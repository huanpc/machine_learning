^ dear all , 
^ what more could you ask for at the end of a hard week than cheap alcohol , comfy chairs and an opportunity to meet other computer scientists ( ! ) ? 
^ if you go to the &name common room ( at the far end of the central corridor on the first floor of the &org ) from 5pm on a friday , this is what you will find . 
^ i 've been a couple of times and it is quite good fun . 
^ there are generally a few people playing games ( go , chess , cards , random pyramid games ) . 
^ &name is about a pound a pint . 
^ check it out !
