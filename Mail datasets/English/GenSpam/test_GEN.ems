^ Volume &NUM : DEVELOPMENT LINGUISTICS - STRATEGIES FOR GROWTH AND CHANGE 
^ ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF LANGUAGE AND LINGUISTICS meets the need for a comprehensive work of reference and deals with all important areas of linguistics and language studies . 
^ The work makes a systematic effort to analyse and describe the current research and thinking in this field , emphasizing the multi-disciplinary nature of the subject . 
^ The volumes are arranged thematically with each volume dedicated to a particular area of specialisation . 
^ In planning the presentation of the Encyclopaedia the main consideration has been in selecting material which present particular theme or idea in a most comprehensive manner making the understanding of this subject much easier . 
^ The main focus in the preparation of this work has been to make it useful for not only the specialist scholars and researchers but also for those wide range of potential users' individuals and institutions' in need of information in this diverse field . 
^ Although the main thrust is on dealing with all major areas in the field of language and linguistics in as comprehensive a manner as possible by treating the ' core ' areas thoroughly , the focus is also on including the new and emergent issues as well . 
^ A significant feature of the Encyclopaedia is its interdisciplinary nature , thus enough space is devoted to aspects of Sociology , Social Development , &NAME , &NAME and Philosophy that impinge on Language . 
^ The work is full of examples and illustrations and contains references and bibliography for each individual subjects being covered . 
^ The comprehensiveness of the scope of this &NAME is indicated by the vast amount of material included covering on one ' hand linguistics as a Science and on the other the Philosophy of linguistics . 
^ It includes Structural linguistics trying to discover the rules of phonology , morphology and syntax that predict how most speakers of the language talk . 
^ The Historical Linguistic covers comparative analysis of cognates and grammar testing the notion that certain languages derive from common ancestral language . 
^ The goals are to reconstruct the features of the Protolanguage , to hypothesize how the off spring languages separated from each other and to establish its common origin . 
^ The volume on &NAME linguistics includes contributions from leaders in this field covering the concepts , language development and functions in detail . 
^ Development of language and its principles has been dealt with separately Recently &NAME have begun to study variations in how people actually use language . 
^ This type of linguistic study called &NAME concerned with the ethnography of speaking is also dealt with in a separate volume . 
^ The Encyclopaedia includes important contributions on the fast developing area of &NAME by contributors who are working on the ' frontiers ' of the study of Language and Linguistics . 
^ Apart from this , the Encyclopaedia covers all major core areas in &NAME &NAME , Development of Language , &NAME , &NAME , Language and Social Development , Problems and Methods In Linguistics and Strategies for Growth and Change . 
^ Readable , comprehensive and current , the Encyclopaedia of Language and Linguistics is intended to serve as a standard reference work in this fast developing and changing discipline .

^ Hi &NAME , continuing on from the last email I sent , sorry about the delay - my code is like a badly sown dress - I pull &NUM thread and spend the next few hours finding where I pulled it apart ! ! 
^ anyway here are the results , as in the last email tungsten example might not result in increase in &NAME , although better than before . 
^ question &NUM however does improve when using a partial &NAME here , ' her ' is resolved to ' actress ' , ' &NAME ' , and ' &NAME ' through &NAME her - &NAME resolution . 
^ As there are very few &NAME matches , the direct substitution results in improvement for these cases . 
^ Perhaps that is a further argument that combined with more complex system that incorporates NE - the system could prefer equal ranking sentences in which the required NE occurs etc ? 
^ anyway table &NUM again ! : 
^ &WEBSITE &CHAR &CHAR &CHAR &CHAR 
^ &NAME - the normal run &NAME baseline + antecedent - manual replacement of sentences + direct substitution - automatic substitution of the pronoun for the antecedent in the original submission sentences . 
^ &NAME - only related &NAME elements &NAME - all elements 
^ The only example where the inner improved using the partial &NAME was in the case of question &NUM where the context was : 
^ ' &NAME &NAME &NAME , mistress of &NAME &NAME &NAME , has been dead for almost &NUM years , but someone remembers . 
^ Earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in &NAME Memorial Park . 
^ Dear &NAME , you are still loved and missed , read the accompanying note . 
^ ' 
^ The original submission sentence read : ' &NAME &NAME &NAME , mistress of &NAME &NAME &NAME , has been dead for almost &NUM years , but someone remembers . ' 
^ however , after pulling in ' actress ' , ' &NAME ' and ' &NAME ' ( as all &NUM had ' &NAME ' arg ) the &NAME selected the correct ( following ) sentence : Earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in &NAME Memorial Park . 
^ Earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on actress &NAME &NAME mausoleum in &NAME Memorial Park . 
^ The real problem is that the shallow parsed &NAME structures result in very few &NAME elements - so the &NAME system is already based mainly upon &NAME and CARG matches . 
^ Therefore without &NAME &NAME representations to start with you are almost always only pulling in the antecedent itself . 
^ hope that 's ok - I 'll be home tomorrow morning if you need to call me !

^ Past Presidents ' Politics 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
</SUBJECT>
<MESSAGE_BODY>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ While I have great respect , both personal and professional , for all our past presidents , I regret that they have chosen to involve us , as &NAME , in this matter . 
^ Although the Presidents state further down in their letter that they are actually divided over the boycott issue and over &NAME &NAME 's actions , the first line of their letter reads : ' We are writing in support of &NAME &NAME ' . 
^ There is no doubt that this line will now receive wide citation in the campaign that supports &NAME &NAME , both in her dispute with &NAME and in her so-called ' personal ' boycott of &NAME nationals . 
^ It may not have been their intention , but with this choice of emphasis the Presidents have given their name , and ours -- for they say : ' We may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the Linguistics Association of &NAME &NAME ' -- to a campaign that says that it is right to limit individuals ' academic freedom if they have a particular nationality , that it is correct to ban fellow scholars not due to their poor professional ethics or even on the basis of their political views but simply because of their place of work ( for those of you who do n't know : both of &NAME 's boycottees are prominent pro-Palestinian human rights activists ) , and that it is legitimate to put political blame for the actions taken by a government on individual fellow academics , although this clearly only holds for &NAME working in &NAME ( I assume that none of us would dream of boycotting , say , Russian colleagues in protest against the flattening of &NAME , or American colleagues in protest against civilian casualties in &NAME , or Turkish colleagues in protest against the -- still existing -- ban on using &NAME in public , etc etc ) . 
^ The Presidents even go on to say that ' we all agree that the discrimination by &NAME against the &NAME raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott , and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention . ' I do not find that acting or arguing against boycotting individuals on the basis of their nationality ( rather than point of view or actions ) diverts either my attention or my energy away from engaging actively for peace in the Middle East . 
^ Quite to the contrary : as an &NAME who has been activley engaged in dialogue with Palestinian friends and colleagues for over &NUM decades now , I feel that the only hope we have is to continue to make use of the freedoms we have as academics to meet and draft ideas for a better future , and for life in peace and collaboration in a country which we must share . 
^ Recall that the talks that had led to the &NAME accords of the early &NUM ( which &NAME appears to oppose , but which brought the only prospect of peace for over a century ) , had been initiated by Palestinian and &NAME academics , meeting abroad , defying a ban on contacts issued by hardliners on both sides . 
^ If we restrict our own freedoms by banning contacts , as &NAME wants , we are doing a service only to those whose aim is to separate our &NUM peoples and to prevent them from ever reaching any common ground . 
^ The Presidents raise concern over ' the potential infringement of &NAME 's liberty ' , and say that ' Whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action , such as the boycott of the &NAME academic community , is not an issue for the employing organisation . ' . 
^ I strongly disagree . 
^ &NUM cannot pretend that we are talking about what an individual acdemic is doing in her free time . 
^ The issue is rather , which standards of academic practice are being set in the public life of our own academic community . 
^ &NAME 's actions were not personal ; they were public gestures by a senior colleague , aimed at changing the standards by which most of us operate . 
^ As members of an academic association in this country , it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour . 
^ It is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate . 
^ The issue of whether or not it is acceptable to ban fellow academics based on their nationality or country of residence or place of work belongs to the code of practice of this academic community . 
^ The issue of whether or not &NAME discriminates the &NAME ( or &NAME the &NAME , or &NAME the Catholics in &NAME &NAME ) , or how to react to such discrimination , does not belong to that code of practice , and is beyond the remit of either the &NAME or an academic institution like &NAME . 
^ In this last respect , I very much regret the double standards that we seem to have in the &NAME : Last autumn , at the &NAME business meeting , I proposed that we should react to the press reports concerning the &NAME Secretary 's statements on the use of mother tongue by immigrants in their homes . 
^ Instead of deciding to act , the assembly accepted a proposal that I should first establish what exactly had been said , that I should then put together a report summarising current research on bilingualism in the family , that I should then draft a reaction citing this research , and then go on to poll the membership via this list , and hope to come up with an agreed statement still to be issued before public opinion completely lost interest in the matter . 
^ It turned out that &NAME had not said what some of the press attributed to him . 
^ Nonetheless , his statement was ambiguous enough to deserve , in my opinion , a reaction clarifying that it is incorrect and improper to suggest a link between linguistic diversity and lack of modernity ( &NAME 's text suggested a link between acquiring English and modernity , while addressing the alleged monolingualism of a large proportion of immigrants ) . 
^ But it took many days to negotiate a text to present on this list , and even the text that was agreed on was not , for some reason , passed on to the list , but was substituted by a notice stripped of any evaluative content . 
^ The &NAME was not , it seemed , as interested in reacting to an issue situated on its own doorstep and which demanded its profesional expertise , as much as it enjoys the inspiration of &NAME &NAME 's ' ban them ! ' campaign . 
^ Perhaps it 's pity that the powers that determine events in &NAME / &NAME are even less affected by what the &NAME says than the British &NAME Secretary .

^ Dear &NAME colleague , This is to report that the recent past presidents of the &NAME have written a letter to the press in support of a fellow linguist . 
^ The letter was published in today 's edition of the &ORG . 
^ The wording makes it clear that we wrote as individuals , not on behalf of the &NAME , but we felt that &NAME members should know about it because we mention the &NAME . 
^ The text of the letter , as published , follows . 
^ &NAME &NAME 
^ We are writing in support of &NAME &NAME , who is under investigation by the University of &NAME Institute for Science and Technology for removing &NUM &NAME members from the editorial board of a journal she privately owns and publishes . 
^ We may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the Linguistics Association of &NAME &NAME . 
^ We believe that &NAME 's treatment of &NAME and subsequent publicity are disproportionate . 
^ Although &NAME denies considering dismissal , &NAME has been publicly reprimanded on the &NAME website and an inquiry set in motion . 
^ Like the rest of the academic community , we are divided over whether or not the boycott of &NAME institutions is justified , and even more so over whether &NAME was right to extend it to individual &NAME scholars . 
^ However , we all agree that the discrimination by &NAME against the &NAME raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott , and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention . 
^ We are also concerned at the potential infringement of &NAME 's liberty by &NAME and at the precedent this would set . 
^ Whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action , such as the boycott of the &NAME academic community , is not an issue for the employing organisation .

^ Dear &NAME contributor , 
^ As I 've noted in earlier correspondence with you , I would like each paper in the volume to contain useful cross-references to other related papers in the book ( assuming that there are other relevant papers ) . 
^ To that end , I 'm writing to suggest that you each make available to the other people on this list your contribution to the evolang . 
^ volume . 
^ I hope and assume that you are currently revising your paper , so I feel it makes sense for you to distribute it as soon as you have a revised version that people could look at . 
^ I 'll leave you each to decide on the best way to do this , but would ask firstly that you undertake to distribute your paper in some way , for instance by sending round an attachment . 
^ ( This list contains only papers that I consider to be related in some way ( &NUM in total ) , so I 've already taken some of the work out of the procedure . ) 
^ Secondly , I ask that you undertake to look at the contributions so received , and refer to them ( as ' &NAME , this volume ' ) where there are interesting relevant points of overlap or controversy , agreement or dispute . 
^ Here , I summarise briefly the contents / key words of the papers on the list ( with apologies to anyone I 've misrepresented - please let me know ! ) : 
^ &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME ; &NAME &NAME : ' Cultural selection for learnability : &NUM hypotheses concerning the characteristic structure of language ' . 
^ ( the relation between language universals and any cognitive basis for language is opaque ; languages themselves adapt to survive by adapting to be learnable ; computational models : iterated learning models ) 
^ &NAME &NAME : ' &NAME of the language faculty and language ( &CHAR ) with decorrelated encodings ' . 
^ ( a correlated simulation model ; genetic assimilation ; protolanguage as learnable without a specific language faculty - can be culturally transmitted ) 
^ &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME : ' Evolution of language diversity : the survival of the fitness ' . 
^ ( Although the assumption that language increases human evolutionary fitness is intuitively appealing , its validity needs to be examined in the light of the indications that a coherent language can emerge in the absence of language-related fitness , e.g. , through a combination of genetic drift and random population diffusion ; computer modelling ) 
^ &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME : ' Acquisition and evolution of natural languages : &NUM puzzles for the price of one ' . 
^ ( simulations charting the emergence and stability of irregularities across &NUM generations of artificial simplicity-based learners using a rudimentary language ; the stability of irregularities in lg . ; &NAME 's Paradox . ) 
^ &NAME &NAME : ' Meaning coordination and communicative success ' ( most previous simulations of lg . 
^ evolution avoid the problem of learning meanings ; this investigates instead the emergence of communication systems without innate or transferable meanings ) . 
^ &NAME &NAME : ' Simulating the evolution of a grammar for case ' ( presents a multi-agent model in which steps towards the evolution of a grammar for case are simulated . 
^ Grammar is seen as an evolving adaptive system that is shaped and negotiated by the agents as they optimise communication . ) 
^ Please let me know if there are any problems or other matters that I can help with . 
^ I do n't think that it 's going to be particularly helpful to me to be included in the ongoing correspondence at this stage , so I 'd be grateful if you 'd delete my address from further exchanges whilst this cross-referencing process is going on . 
^ Thanks .

<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ In text mining , I find it useful to distinguish between these &NUM ways in which text can carry information about real world entities : 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The information about the entity is present as a natural language utterance in the text , e.g. ' Mrs. ' 
^ &NAME lives in &NAME . ' 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ The textual record is linked to the person , and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity . 
^ For instance , Mrs. &NAME in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary , make references to locations , etc. that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in &NAME . 
^ The distinction is not sharp , and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways . 
^ Linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun ' &NUM ' using the ' Sender : ' field of the email rather than a name in the text . 
^ In practice , however , I find the &NUM to be very different . 
^ In particular , &NAME &NUM is much more susceptible to text classification approaches . 
^ One assumes the whole document is ' about ' the person to which it is linked , and you classify the person by classifying the document . 
^ In &NAME &NUM , however , you have to be much more serious about the &NAME , since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you 're interested in , and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference . 
^ Anyway , I 'm trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about &NAME &NUM vs. &NAME &NUM . 
^ ' &NAME ' vs. ' &NAME ' ? 
^ ' Third person vs. First person ' ? 
^ Any suggestions ?

^ Hi all , &NUM absolutely second &NAME 's post . 
^ In fact , I have issues in principle with anonymization , as this will obviously affect phonological aspects of the corpus , due to the very anonymization . 
^ Likewise , it will tend to skew proper nouns , as these are the &NUM anonymized , generally , and these are some issues which interest me particularly . 
^ I know that people have addressed the general issue , and the ethical questions are real , but there must be some way around this problem .

^ I guess that this means ' bad language ' ( I assume it does not rel ate to anonymization issues as they are covered in &NAME 's point &NUM ).If this is about ' bleeping out ' words in corpora , should n't we encourage &NAME not to do this ?

^ &NUM Analyse the CIDE / &NAME definitions for the target verbs to find the candidate substitutable terms . 
^ I am not sure whether this will be too difficult or not . 
^ The idea would be that if you had a definition like CIDE 's 
^ extinguish to stop ( a fire or light ) burning ' 
^ you 'd want to get something like 
^ stop ( &NAME ) burning ' 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ I suspect this will get quite interesting , for example the definition of ' douse ' is : 
^ to stop ( a fire or light ) burning or shining , esp . 
^ by putting water on it or covering it with something . ' 
^ so he 'll need to decide whether or not to get rid of parentheticals , and more importantly , whether he 's dousing a light or fire ! 
^ interestingly , the definition of extinguish does n't have the or shining ' bit in it . 
^ I suspect paraphrasing will only help when the paraphrase is reasonably short . 
^ Again , &NAME might be in a good position to decide on how short . 
^ &NAME seems to be the opposite of what the summarisation crowd call ' content conflation ' . 
^ Example from ( &NAME , &NUM ) : 
^ &NAME defeated &NAME &NUM . 
^ It was a tight game where the lead kept changing ' can be conflated to generate &NAME outlasted &NAME &NUM ' 
^ not quite sure how she does that though . 
^ definitely not from the cide definition of ' outlast ' .

^ Well done the presidents ! 
^ &NAME &NAME 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Dear &NAME colleague , This is to report that the recent past presidents of the &NAME have written a letter to the press in support of a fellow linguist . 
^ The letter was published in today 's edition of the &NAME . 
^ The wording makes it clear that we wrote as individuals , not on behalf of the &NAME , but we felt that &NAME members should know about it because we mention the &NAME . 
^ The text of the letter , as published , follows . 
^ &NAME &NAME 
^ We are writing in support of &NAME &NAME , who is under investigation by the University of &NAME Institute for Science and Technology for removing &NUM &NAME members from the editorial board of a journal she privately owns and publishes . 
^ We may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the Linguistics Association of &NAME &NAME . 
^ We believe that &NAME 's treatment of &NAME and subsequent publicity are disproportionate . 
^ Although &NAME denies considering dismissal , &NAME has been publicly reprimanded on the &NAME website and an inquiry set in motion . 
^ Like the rest of the academic community , we are divided over whether or not the boycott of &NAME institutions is justified , and even more so over whether &NAME was right to extend it to individual &NAME scholars . 
^ However , we all agree that the discrimination by &NAME against the &NAME raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott , and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention . 
^ We are also concerned at the potential infringement of &NAME 's liberty by &NAME and at the precedent this would set . 
^ Whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action , such as the boycott of the &NAME academic community , is not an issue for the employing organisation .

^ She is quiet and a little diffident but I found her very pleasant to work with and , as time passed , she relaxed and became more confident . 
^ I have little doubt that she would fit in well into your office and work diligently and effectively .

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ How are you ? 
^ I thought it was well past time I wrote you a quick email to tell you what has been happening down here . 
^ &NAME was spent writing up though not enough writing since I had to get an extension till the new year . 
^ I still have a lot to do ( and there 's only &NUM weeks left ! ) but I will hopefully be done soon . 
^ Submission day is January 6th which coincides with the start of my new job here in &NAME . 
^ I mentioned &NAME &NAME to you when I came to &NAME for the interview . 
^ Shortly after the &NAME visit , she mentioned an advert for a job and encouraged me to apply . 
^ It sounded like a very interesting project , certainly very different to what I do at the moment ... The hypothesis is that encouraging children to reflect on the double meanings in jokes leads to an increase in their text comprehension . 
^ Pilot studies have supported this . 
^ I get to work in the schools with the kids as well which is one of the very positive aspects to the project . 
^ The name of the project is &NAME . 
^ My role in it is , somewhat unsurprisingly , the techie person -- I write the software and the website . 
^ How is getting the course online going ? 
^ I am still planning on developing &NAME come the new year ... 
^ I hope you and your family are keeping well -- please send them my regards and season 's greetings ! 
^ Take care , 
^ &NAME .

^ Dear all , Interactive websites for teaching &NAME and corpus linguistics 
^ Do you know of any neat websites that could be used to demo and teach about &NAME and corpus linguistics ? 
^ I am surveying what is available , either produced for teaching or which ( like some product demos ) could play a useful role in teaching . 
^ My goals are both for input to our MSc ( &NAME &NAME and &NAME ) and as a small research project into the web and pedagogy ( with ref to &NAME / corpus linguistics ) . 
^ Feedback from students and teachers about how well the sites supported student learning are of particular interest . 
^ Items of most interest are those that do not have access restrictions , do not involve installing anything and will make sense to decent linguistics majors ( eg not too specialist ) 
^ Examples / items already on my list include : 
^ &NAME Research &NAME &NAME 's parser , dependency database , corpus-based word clusters etc &WEBSITE &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME 's OpenMind page for doing manual &NAME &WEBSITE &NAME : &WEBSITE 
^ Web research &NAME labs - sets function ( also now-almost-standard search engine functions like translation , access to online dictionaries , view-as-html , similar-pages ) citeseer 
^ &NAME commercial &NAME tagger and parser 
^ Corpus query &NAME online &NAME &NAME 's Multext-east bilingual concordancing &NAME &NAME 's corpus lingustics ( in Spanish ) &WEBSITE 
^ Other - computer science &NAME learning : &WEBSITE Do n't quite meet the criteria as they 're not very interactive but worth including nonetheless- Corpora 's own archive , plus indexes into it from &WEBSITE &NAME 
^ If I get much interest , I 'll post a summary .

^ DATE : Thursday 16th January &NUM 
^ TIME : &NUM : &NUM - &NUM : &NUM 
^ PLACE : &NAME Theatre , &NAME Research Ltd &NUM &CHAR &CHAR &NAME Avenue ( Off &NAME Road ) &NAME 
^ TITLE : &NAME task versus Filtering / Routing task : No , You &NAME Just Take Your Pick 
^ This talk focuses on &NUM aspect of document-query duality . 
^ In this talk , ' duality ' refers to the fact that given a data set , one might arbitrarily choose to perform either query-oriented estimation or document-oriented estimation . 
^ I explain that this duality is not a choice , but a problem , for almost any conceivable approach to parameter estimation in &NAME , and it is rarely adequately addressed . 
^ Early Language &NAME efforts made this problem worse , in some respects , but a consensus is emerging about how to solve the problem . 
^ I will present a probabilistic solution , whose principles can be adapted to a wide variety of &NAME models ( i.e. even non-probabilistic &NUM ) . 
^ Experiments using the proposed solution show that , at least in &NUM respect , queries are as informative as documents are , contrary to a widely held belief . 
^ There are also important implications for construction of &NAME data sets .

^ &CHAR ) I have now also a semiautomatic mechanism in place that sends &NAME students an invitation to turn their thesis into a &NAME as soon as it shows up as approved in the student-admin database . 
^ &CHAR ) I 'm working with &NAME and &NAME to ensure that we keep a good bibliographic record of all accepted PhD theses in the lab database ( there were a couple of odd glitches to be fixed , e.g. so far we recorded only the first &NUM characters of thesis titles for obscure reasons ) . 
^ I believe , this information should go onto the web at some point when the data set is reliable enough . 
^ &CHAR ) We still have no mechanism in place to ensure that all approved lab PhD theses are easily accessible to other lab members ( other than having to go to the UL ) . 
^ &CHAR significant fraction of students disappear after submission without turning their thesis into a &NAME or at least hand &NAME a copy .

^ We are going to be very short-staffed in Reception over the summer . 
^ We are loosing &NAME &NAME to another job in June , and &NAME &NAME goes on maternity leave at about the same time . 
^ This is good for them but makes life difficult for us ! 
^ It means that &NAME &NAME will be on her own until we can recruit a replacement for &NAME . 
^ &NAME works part-time so it is inevitable that Reception will be closed for considerable periods , probably most of the afternoons and all day on Fridays . 
^ Even before &NAME and &NAME leave , there will be days when staff holidays cause short-term difficulties , so from today &NAME may be closed from time to time . 
^ I very much regret the lack of service and seek your forbearance during a difficult time . 
^ Many thanks

^ Dear Dr. &NAME , 
^ I am a visiting postdoctoral Mathematics researcher at the &NAME institute for Mathematics in &NAME , &NAME . 
^ I would like to apologize for sending you unsolicited e-mail . 
^ If I had not felt myself in desperate need of your guidance I would not have ventured to do so . 
^ At the moment my topic of research is mainly in Pure Mathematics . 
^ Specifically , the subject of my Ph. &NAME has been in Algebraic Topology . 
^ I received my Ph. &NAME degree at &NAME University in &NUM . 
^ I am now a little more than &NUM years beyond my Ph. &NAME and , increasingly , I feel that I do not really want to continue in Pure mathematics . 
^ In fact I would very much like to move into the area of language processing . 
^ This subject seems to encompass all &NUM of my interests : languages , logic and computers . 
^ In particular , I am interested in modeling the human language acquisition process via computer programming and mathematical analysis . 
^ I believe my mathematical background will enable me to quickly acquire the necessary computational background . 
^ This leaves me to concentrate on the formal study of linguistics . 
^ In this light , I thought a good fist step would be to take the &NAME &NAME . 
^ course in &NAME &NAME offered in your department and perhaps continue onto a second research degree . 
^ However , I am told that I can not be awarded a second higher degree from &NAME because of the Ph. &NAME I have already obtained . 
^ ( is this true ? ) 
^ I am writing to you in the hopes that you might have suggestions or advice on possible opportunities for me to do research in your department , interact with the people in your department and attend the courses offered in relation to the &NAME &NAME . 
^ degree I have mentioned above . 
^ I would be grateful for your help . 
^ Yours faithfully , 
^ &NAME &NAME

^ June 30-July &NUM , &NUM &WEBSITE 
^ Corpus linguistics studies take advantage of the existence of large collections of language production ( written or spoken language ) in order to investigate a language . 
^ Foreign language pedagogy is now beginning to see new possibilities for recent advances in corpus linguistics to improve language teaching and learning . 
^ Readily available Korean-language corpora and easy-to-use tools can now be used on the spot in a language teaching context , by teachers and learners without extensive training in computational linguistics , and studies of linguistic features can be tailored to specific pedagogic context and learning requirements . 
^ The &NAME &NAME Institute workshop ' Corpus Linguistics for Korean Language Learning and &NAME ' will acquaint participants with the basic concepts of corpus linguistics , including corpus construction and &NAME , concordancing , frequency counts and ranks , grammatical tagging , and related concepts . 
^ Participants will learn how to access Korean corpora and how to use the available computer programs for Korean corpus analysis . 
^ The workshop will outline techniques for the teacher to use in materials preparation and curriculum design and for the individual learner to use in exploring meaning , structure , and use in Korean . 
^ In the second part of the workshop , participants will engage in individual projects chosen with their own learning goals in mind .

^ ( MESSAGE_BODY ) Hi &NAME , 
^ It appears that the emails you send do not have a ' &NAME ' field in their headers . 
^ Without the content-type field , it is unclear how to interpret the content , and thus for safety sake , my system will remove such emails from the corpus . 
^ I cannot assume that emails that do n't have content-type fields are always in plain text , as this is not the case with some of the emails I have already collected . 
^ This means that you would get a blank response from the &NAME EMAIL thing . 
^ In this case I added a content-type field , specifying plain text so you should have got a reply anyway . 
^ Have you got any idea why your email prog would leave out the content-type field ? 
^ Do many others use the same email client ?

^ We will leave the theme park at about 6pm when it shuts and then go out for a meal and a few drinks in &NAME . 
^ Then I will hopefully be able to book a football pitch ( probably not &NAME Park ) for the Sunday to have a kick about and then we can all go home in the afternoon !

^ &NAME : Document filtering : tasks , models and implementation 
^ Speaker : &NAME &NAME - &NAME Research 
^ &NAME : 
^ Much information retrieval research revolves around a canonical model of a search task : a user issuing a query to a ( temporarily static ) document collection , and being presented with a ranked list of documents ( with perhaps a feedback loop ) . 
^ This model informs many aspects of the work 
^ - - the kinds of theoretical approach taken , many implementation issues including the design of efficient , fast-response systems , the measurement of effectiveness and the qualitative testing of systems . 
^ However , we may take a number of different views of the information task itself and the user context in which that task occurs . 
^ &NUM alternative is represented by the filtering task , as defined for the &NAME exercise . 
^ Here filtering is seen as a content-based , adaptive task applied to an incoming stream of documents , involving user needs represented by profiles . 
^ In this talk , I will explore the nature of this task , and some of the ways in which it must be treated differently from the canonical model . 
^ I will address both conceptual and implementation issues , and discuss some experimental results from &NAME .

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ both &NAME and I have had a go at the CfP . 
^ There are a few things we 're not sure about : 
^ &NUM ) Submission formats do n't appear to be clear from the &NAME web site . 
^ &NUM ) We made up the dates -- do they sound reasonable ? 
^ Let us know what you think ! 
^ &NAME . 
^ Call for Papers : 
^ Journal of &NAME &NAME 
^ Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 
^ &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL 
^ The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . 
^ It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . 
^ The importance of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950's and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . 
^ The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . 
^ This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . 
^ This special issue of the Journal of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in July &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . 
^ Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : 
^ * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . 
^ Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? 
^ How should they be combined ? 
^ Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? 
^ Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? 
^ * Evaluation of &NAME systems . 
^ Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? 
^ Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? 
^ Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? 
^ Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? 
^ * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . 
^ How do these affect &NAME ? 
^ How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? 
^ Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? 
^ What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? 
^ * The effect of &NAME on applications . 
^ To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? 
^ What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? 
^ What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? 
^ * Minimising the need for handtagged data . 
^ &NAME text is expensive and difficult to obtain while untagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . 
^ What techniques can be used to make use of untagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? 
^ What use can be made of parallel text ? 
^ Can untagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ? 
^ Important Dates 
^ Submission &NUM October &NUM Notification of acceptance &NUM November &NUM &NAME copy due &NUM December &NUM 
^ Submission Information 
^ All submissions will be subject to the normal peer review process for this journal . 
^ Submissions in electronic form ( &NAME ) are strongly preferred and must conform to the &NAME specifications , which are available at :

^ Electronic submissions , and any questions , should be sent to &EMAIL

^ Hi ! 
^ As might have been very correctly observed by several of you at different stages , although it is a small one , which should logically help , our &NAME group lacks some of the characteristics that would justify that appellation : we know little or nothing about each other 's research , methods , sometimes even interests . 
^ This is something I know some of us have at some point felt sorry about . 
^ Luckily , &NAME and &NAME have now decided to give it a try . 
^ They asked me to organize something that would allow everyone to get the chance to explain what they are doing , on an informal basis . 
^ However , for the aim to be reached , it is important that everyone of us takes part in the event . 
^ Attendance is therefore highly recommended ( not to say obligatory ) . 
^ The plan , given that we are &NUM of us , is to held &NUM afternoons at a few weeks ' interval . 
^ All members of the group would give a &NUM min talk , &NUM on each afternoon . 
^ Rather than being about results of the research only , these talks should mostly be a short description of current research , methods and tools used and designed , problems met , ie. points that can be useful for the entire group , and about which some useful feedback or ideas could be given by other members of the group . 
^ After each talk , &NUM min would indeed be allocated for questions and / or comments . 
^ After the talks we would then do something together , and &NAME has already offered to host a pizza & drinks get-together at his place for one of the afternoons . 
^ Everything is possible and if you 've got any idea , let me know . 
^ Dates for the &NUM afternoons have been already suggested . 
^ &NAME &NUM or &NAME &NUM June &NAME &NUM or &NAME &NUM July . 
^ We want to make sure that everyone could attend . 
^ Therefore , please send me your comments about these dates , if you definitely ca n't make &NUM or several of them . 
^ I think this is a wonderful idea , &NAME going for . 
^ I 'm sure we can make something of it , provided everyone puts a little goodwill into it . 
^ I 'll be co-ordinating these events , so please send me all comments directly . 
^ If you think this is not the best way of doing it , feel free to send any other idea as well . 
^ Cheers , 
^ &NAME

^ Call for Papers & &NAME : &NAME &NAME on &NAME in Biological & Software Systems 
^ &NAME and &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ sponsored by &ORG ( &NAME of &NAME ) The University of &NAME &ORG &NAME &NAME on &NAME in Biological and Software Systems 
^ &NUM April &NUM ( &NAME ) , University of &NAME , &NAME 
^ &NAME Speakers : 
^ * &NAME &NAME ( &NAME University , &NAME ) * &NAME &NAME ( &NAME University , &NAME ) * &NAME &NAME ( &NAME Institute , University of &NAME , &NAME ) * &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) * &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) 
^ SYMPOSIUM AIMS 
^ This &NAME symposium follows upon the growing awareness from academia , industry , and research communities of the importance of evolvability , tentatively defined as , the capacity of populations to exhibit adaptive heritable &NAME partcular , the symposium focuses on the relation between evolvability and sensor and effector evolution . 
^ The symposium aims to encourage a dialogue between various workers in areas that might benefit from a possible common framework addressing evolvability and sensor / effector evolution . 
^ The symposium addresses &NUM aspects that are believed to be central in understanding fundamental biological mechanisms , like information information discovery , acquisition , processing and transmission , both on the level of populations and individuals : these mechanisms are evolvability and sensor evolution . 
^ &NAME 
^ Darwinian evolution characterized by heritable variation and selection is not by itself sufficient to account for the capacity to vary and inherent phenotypic expressions of fitness . 
^ Rigidity of genotype-phenotype mappings , as often used in evolutionary computation , constrains the dynamics of evolution to a small space of possible biological or artificial systems . 
^ Open-ended evolution is not possible under such constraints . 
^ &NAME , by itself , cannot fully explain the advant of genetic systems , the flexible genotype-phenotype mappings , heritable fitness . 
^ This presents a challenge both to biologists seeking to understand the capacity of life to evolve and to computer scientists who seek to harness biological-like robustness and openness in the evolution of artificial systems . 
^ To what extent does evolvability require a population of discrete individuals on which to act ? 
^ How can higher levels of sensory individuality arise ? 
^ &NAME has been variously defined as the ' genome 's ability to produce adaptive variants when acted on by the genetic system ' ( &NAME & &NAME , &NUM ) , as the ' capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation ' ( &NAME & &NAME , &NUM ) ; and as characterized by evolutionary watersheds ' opening the ' floodgates to future evolution ' , such as segmentation and body plans ( &NAME , &NUM ) . 
^ On the other hand , unconstrained or inappropriately constrained variability and change can lead to lack of stability , ' cancer ' , nonheritability of fitness , lack of evolutionary power , and so on . 
^ &NAME &NAME 
^ In natural evolution one finds impressive examples of the principle of exploiting and creating new sensory channels and information they carry . 
^ &NAME , tactile , auditory and visual , but also e.g. electrical and even magnetic senses have evolved in a multitude of variants , often utilizing organs not originally ' intended ' for the purpose they serve at present . 
^ Biologically evolving systems are able to adaptively construct their own hardware and software . 
^ The new sensors create new ways of giving meaning to and interpreting the world . 
^ Many biological sensors reach a degree of structural and functional complexity and of efficiency which is envied by engineers creating man-made sensors . 
^ Sensors enable animals to survive in dynamic and unstructured environments , to perceive and react appropriately to features in the biotic and abiotic environment , including members of the own species as well as predators and prey . 
^ &NAME artificial sensors for hardware or software systems suggests a similar approach taken for generating life-like behaviour , namely using evolutionary techniques in order to explore design spaces and generate sensors which are specifically adapted with respect to environmental and other fitness related constraints . 
^ The creation of channels of sensory input and effectory output lead to higher evolvability as new relevance criteria are developed that confer a survival advantage to future offspring . 
^ CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS 
^ We solicit abstracts for poster or oral presentation ( appox . 
^ &NUM minute talk ) reporting working in this exciting area . 
^ Talks should address an interdisciplinary audience , but may nevertheless deal with issues at the cutting edge of research .

^ The submission should show author name ( &CHAR ) , full addresses , submission title , and an abstract of not more than &NUM words . 
^ Submissions should include a statement of the preferred mode of presentation : poster / oral . 
^ TOPIC FOCUS ON EVOLVABILITY & SENSOR EVOLUTION 
^ Suitable topics are or involve ( this is not an exhaustive list ! ) : * Evolution of physical sensors * Formation of Relevance criteria * Design concepts for artificial sensors and their evolution , the role of sensors in building complete , autonomous agents and how they interact with the environment * Relationship between sensors , perception and actuation * Simulated artificial sensors , experiments modeling natural sensor evolution * Abstract sensor evolution models , abstract mathematical modeling of evolution of sensors and the information processing required * Features of the Genotype-Phenotype Mapping and relation to sensor evolution * Modularity & &NAME * Evolution of Individuality * Organogenesis * Genetic Control of &NAME &NAME * Signal &NAME & Robustness in &NAME * &NAME of Environmental Variation * Evolution of Complexity * Co-evolution of Control , &NAME , and Ontogeny * &NAME Evolution * Selecting for &NAME * Embodiment and &NAME &NAME * Evolution of Sensory Processing

^ Dear &NAME , &NAME and &NAME , 
^ I should have to do a contract with the &NAME organization if they wish to pursue a bulk order for the Special Issue with us , confirming the financial arrangements I would have to negotiate with them . 
^ If they do not request such bulk order , we do not have to care about an official contract . 
^ Shall I contact &NAME &NAME ? 
^ &NAME regards , 
^ &NAME . 
^ &NAME 
^ The Editors seem to agree on this . 
^ The point about quality made by &NAME will be stressed to the Editors of the SI and we can review the size of the issue a bit further down the line . 
^ What do we do now to formally confirm this with the &NAME &NAME and workshop organisers . 
^ In the past , Academic Press used to have a formal contract with the &NAME &NAME . 
^ What does &NAME do ?

^ The guest editor will by &NAME &NAME &NAME from &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME + a second US editor to be decided . 
^ I support this proposal . 
^ Does everyone else agree ?

^ Further to the above and addressing the issues you raised , the views of the &NAME are that : &CHAR ) &NAME &NAME &NAME would be &NUM &NAME , another ( probably US-side ) to be agreed . 
^ &EMAIL &CHAR ) we should aim for 4th qurater ' &NUM &CHAR ) we should request a double issue based on ~5 papers / issue

^ Many thanks &NAME . 
^ I 'll put these points to the &NAME . 
^ I know there is a strong view that the time between the &NAME and publication of the SI should be short as possible ( without compromising standards ) . 
^ As to number of papers , my guess would be possibly as many &NUM given the status of the meetings , but we could simply restrict it to the &NUM or &NUM for &NUM issue .

^ &NAME 
^ This workshop clearly falls within the scope of &NAME and my initial reaction to your email is very positive . 
^ To move forwards , we need more information 
^ &CHAR ) We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed - preferably &NUM . 
^ &CHAR ) We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you . 
^ I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop . 
^ You then need to give them time to produce the full paper , send it out to referees , allow revisions , final review and accept . 
^ ( This looks to me like 4th quarter &NUM or 1st quarter &NUM ) 
^ &CHAR ) A single issue of &NAME will accommodate &NUM or &NUM papers . 
^ To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue . 
^ How many papers do you anticipate accepting ? 
^ If you can answer the above , then the editors can make a final decision . 
^ Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to &NAME . 
^ Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by &NUM independent reviewers . 
^ The guest editors make the accept / reject decision but one of the regular &NAME editors is assigned to assist in the process ( probably me in this case ) . 
^ If you have detailed questions about publication procedures , please contact &NAME van der &NAME at &NAME ( for email see cc list ) .

^ In essence we 'd like to repeat the successful previous &NAME practice : selected papers for a journal SI .

^ &NAME , I have just received your email . 
^ I sent the &NAME paper at the last minute ( when I heard the deadline got extended ) . 
^ I thought writing it would help me focus and I certainly did not expect it to be accepted as a poster . 
^ I will not present the poster if you think it is a bad idea . 
^ I am sorry that I did not discuss my progress with you earlier . 
^ I would be very grateful if we could meet up . 
^ I have started implementing a system that takes in parsed text and identifies edus according to the guidelines . 
^ I have also read &NAME 's book and his papers describing the semantics of discourse relations . 
^ I have a modified version of the edu report with the discourse relations and their semantics included in it . 
^ I would particularly like to focus on the attribution verbs . 
^ The modified definition of parenthetical units is also not precise enough .

^ TITLE : Automated Application-level Checkpointing of &NAME Programs 
^ Recent trends in supercomputing are leading us towards &NUM new types of supercomputing platforms : large arrays of commodity parts and grid computing . 
^ While both platforms promise to be more cost effective than their monolithic predecessors , they suffer from increased failure rates ( as high as one failed processor a day ) due their size and the fact that they are not manufactured by a single entity . 
^ At the same time many computational tasks like protein folding and materials science simulations are becoming larger , taking weeks , months or even a year to compute . 
^ In short , program runtimes are greatly exceeding the meantime to failure of their platforms . 
^ Our work deals with automatic methods for enabling applications to survive hardware faults . 
^ We have developed a way of recording program state at the application-level by using a preprocessor to get the program save its own state . 
^ Furthermore , we have developed and implemented a distributed coordination protocol that arranges checkpoints from individual processors into a consistent global recovery line . 
^ When any processors fail , everybody else can roll back to their most recent checkpoint and resume their computation , with very little work lost .

^ I use the CLEF Corpora that I have managed for the problem of Multilingual Text categorisation .

^ Original Message From &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) &NAME , 
^ What corpus are you using for your experiments ? 
^ I think that the second solution will work well if you are using a general corpus . 
^ However , one of the problem I have observed when using &NAME in other domains ( like medicine or biology ) is that the translation of domain specific terms will be very poor . 
^ In this case you will need have a domain specific multilingual dictionary that could be included in the &NAME system .

<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ For some days I have sent a message to ask whether you know references in ' categorization of multilingual texts ' . 
^ I thank all the people who answered my question . 
^ I asked this question because I have been interested on this subject for some months . 
^ According to the answers received , I can say that there are not works on this subject compared to works in the &NAME ( cross-language information retrieval ) . 
^ The problem , that I treat , is as follows : 
^ Suppose that we have some corpora in several languages . 
^ The subjects of these corpora are comparable . 
^ Each text of these corpora is label by &NUM or more classes ( subjects ) . 
^ It is about sotries of newspapers in several languages which cover different subjects like ' Conflict in &NAME , Conflict of Interests in &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , Destruction of Ukrainian nuclear weapons , &NAME American car industry , . ... The objective is to use the techniques of texts categorization on these corpora . 
^ Our hope is to be able to know the subject of each new text whatever its language . 
^ At the beginning I had &NUM possible solutions , suppose that &NAME &NUM , .. , &CHAR where &CHAR is the number of languages and &NAME &NUM , ... , &NAME , where C_l_i is the number of classes for the language &NAME : 
^ &NUM the first solution is to learn a model for each language ; thus if I have &NUM languages , I must learn &NUM models ( &NUM for each ) , then , in the phase of classification , for each new text one identifies its language and applies the model of this language on it . 
^ This is the simplest solution and the most direct but this solution is limited because it supposes to have sufficient quantity of texts for each class and for each language and it require &CHAR learning . 
^ &NUM The second solution is to learn on only &NUM language &NAME ( as we do usually ) and then , for each new text , one identifies its language and one translates it by an automatic translator into the language &NAME and then one applies the learned model of the language &NAME on the translated text . 
^ I made experiments on the &NUM approaches and according to obtained results the second solution perfomes well . 
^ Therefore , the introduction of machine translation , in the process of categorization , helps to recognize the subject of a text . 
^ All comments , helps or ideas are welcome .

^ &NAME &NAME , 
^ I 'm working on this topic as part of my Ph. &NAME thesis on &NAME &NAME Signals from &NAME ' . 
^ In this work I have shown that the position of words in the text is more successful at recognizing topic words than non-positional word statistics usually used in &NAME . 
^ By ' topic words ' I mean words that are generally used in discussin &CHAR the topic . 
^ For example : ' Belief Networks ' and ' &NAME &NAME ' are topic phrases for Artificial Intelligence . 
^ Note , however , that this work focuse &CHAR on words only at this stage . 
^ Given a training set for a topic &CHAR , our approach is used to extract ' topic words ' for &NAME Thus , &CHAR is represented by this set of topic words . 
^ When the system is introduced with some new document &CHAR , it uses &CHAR 's topic words to evaluate the intensity of discussion on topic &CHAR in the new document . 
^ The more &CHAR topic words there are , and the more condensed they are , the more intense the discussion at that point in &NAME 
^ I can send you more details as soon as the writeup is done . 
^ Please let me know if you are interested .

^ Hi , 
^ I am want to explore some other way to classify and / or understand texts . 
^ I have some experience in words-occurrence statistic techniques , but I ju st want more :- ) . 
^ In fact I am looking for works about algorithms able to learn grammar basics , phrase structure or just words relationships ( location in text , common topic , .. ) . 
^ The idea is to get an algorithm able to ' read ' a &NAME &CHAR , extract some ' topics ' just in time- and even ' predict ' what will be read in order to get an opinion about the text . 
^ I would prefer some non-natural-language-processing as long as animals can learn a language without grammar knowledge ( .. It seems .. ) . 
^ .. I know , that goes away from classic text classification. . 
^ Does it already exist something going in this direction ?

^ &NUM . 
^ would a side agrement and no &CHAR / &CHAR agreement until funding is raised be constitutional ? 
^ I 've not dealt with a case like the one proposed and wonder whether the savings in not duplicating the work of &NUM &CHAR / hs agreements ( pre-money and post-money ) is not outweighed by the sort of issues indicated above . 
^ Having a simple &CHAR / &CHAR agreement from the outset should n't be too expensive in time or money ?

^ Thanks for your reply . 
^ My main concern with this type of thresholding is that this is no longer a &NAME classifier , because the &NAME decision rule assigns each example to the class with the highest score ( posterior probability ) , regardless of the absolute values of the scores . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ In fact , it is still a Naive &NAME classifier , though with an altered class prior . 
^ For example , if the class &NUM likelihood is twice the class &NUM likelihood , then an even prior ( &NUM for both classes ) will yield &CHAR ' &NUM ' label ( since the posterior for the class &NUM will be larger ) . 
^ But , a prior that weights class &NUM sufficiently heavily ( e.g. &NUM for class &NUM , &NUM for class &NUM ) will yield &CHAR ' &NUM ' label for the document . 
^ If you look at log-probabilities , &NAME &NAME is simply a linear classifier and the class prior is the ' bias ' or ' threshold ' term . 
^ Section &NUM of this paper might help to clarify things a bit :

^ 2nd CALL FOR PAPERS 
^ &ORG-2003 Workshop on &NAME Expressions : &NAME , &NAME and &NAME 
^ &NUM July &NUM , &NAME , &NAME 
^ WEBSITES 
^ Workshop website : &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME website : &WEBSITE 
^ WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION 
^ &NAME expressions ( &NAME ) include a large range of linguistic phenomenon , such as phrasal verbs ( e.g. ' add up ' ) , nominal compounds ( e.g. ' telephone box ' ) , and institutionalized phrases ( e.g. ' salt and &NAME ' ) , and they can be syntactically and / or semantically idiosyncratic in nature . 
^ &NAME are used frequently in everyday language , usually to express precisely ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word . 
^ A considerable amount of research has been devoted to this subject , both in terms of theory and practice , but despite increasing interest in idiomaticity within linguistic research , there is still a gap between the needs of &NAME and the descriptive tradition of linguistics . 
^ Owing to the lack of adequate resources to identify and treat &NAME properly , they pose a real challenge for &NAME . 
^ Most real-world applications tend to ignore &NAME or address them simply by listing . 
^ However , it is clear that successful applications will need to be able to identify and treat them appropriately . 
^ This particularly applies to the many applications which require some degree of semantic processing ( e.g. machine translation , question-answering , summarisation , generation ) . 
^ In recent years there has been a growing awareness in the &NAME community of the problems that &NAME pose and the need for their robust handling . 
^ A considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area , some within large research projects dedicated to &NAME ( e.g. the &NAME Expression Project ) . 
^ There is also a growing interest in &NAME in projects focused on tasks such as parsing ( e.g. Robust Accurate &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) ) and word sense disambiguation ( e.g. MEANING - &NAME &NAME &NAME Language Technologies ) which are required by real-world applications . 
^ Previous workshops on &NAME have focused on certain &NAME types , notably collocations , terminology and named entities . 
^ There are , however , further subtypes of &NAME , which are highly relevant for &NAME tasks but which have not to date received specific attention . 
^ &NUM example are lexicalised ( non- or semi-compositional ) &NAME which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation . 
^ TARGET AUDIENCE 
^ This workshop is intended to bring together &NAME researchers working on all areas of &NAME . 
^ The objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area , to establish common themes between different approaches , and to discuss future trends , with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different &NAME ( sub ) types pose for real-world &NAME applications . 
^ AREAS OF INTEREST 
^ Papers are invited on , but not limited to , the following topics : 
^ * Theoretical research on &NAME 
^ * &NAME taxonomies , classifications and databases 
^ * Corpus based analysis of &NAME 
^ * Cross-lingual analysis of &NAME types , use , and behaviour 
^ * Methods for identification and extraction of &NAME ( machine learning , statistical , example- or rule-based , or hybrid ) 
^ * Evaluation of &NAME extraction methods 
^ * Integration of &NAME data into grammars and &NAME applications ( e.g. machine translation and generation ) 
^ * &NAME &NAME ( or &NAME types ) pose for &NAME applications and solutions proposed 
^ Papers can cover &NUM or more of these areas . 
^ SUBMISSION INFORMATION 
^ Papers should be submitted electronically in Postscript or &NAME format to : &EMAIL . 
^ Submissions should conform to the two-column format of &NAME proceedings and should not exceed &NUM ( &SMILEY pages , including references . 
^ We strongly recommend the use of &ORG-2003 style files , also available from the &ORG-2003 website .

^ Our aim is to understand the principles which allow the design of robust 
^ robot controllers using artificial evolution . 
^ To do so , we seek to distil the critical elements of natural evolution and apply these principles to 
^ our own ends . 
^ Having examined the developmental literature , we hypothesise that evolution acts incrementally and compositionally to construct systems consisting of hierarchical autonomous resonant primitives ( &NAME ) . 
^ This is ' what ' is developed . 
^ ' How ' these HARPs are developed is a related but distinct question which we then address . 
^ Evidence is presented from evolutionary computation , developmental neuroscience , and complex systems research to support the validity of this re-formulation . 
^ The existence of &NAME has been alluded to in &NAME 's ' nearly-decomposable systems ' , in work on the evolution of modularity and in recent work subsumed under the term ' dynamical hierarchies ' . 
^ We hypothesise that degeneracy , canalization , and biological complexity exist as a consequence of the existence of HARPs . 
^ We hypothesise that HARPs can be utilized to help solve the competing conventions problem so facilitating effective recombination . 
^ We hypothesise that HARPs underlie the massive ontogenic re-organizability seen in nervous systems , in genomes themselves , and indeed in any biological system and so confers ontogenic robustness which facilitates increased evolvability . 
^ Evolutionary approaches to neural network design have rarely utilized HARPs , and this review seeks to demonstrate their existence and sets the 
^ background for a research program to investigate them .

^ Everybody concerned with teaching is reminded that the &NAME machines ( which include the student workstations in the Intel Lab and &NAME &NUM ) are updated by the &NAME Service according to a strict annual timetable . 
^ Now is the time to be thinking about any changes that may be needed for the academic year &NUM . 
^ It would probably be best if requests for changes were channelled through &NAME or me , particularly if they might have financial implications . 
^ A copy of the formal notice from the Director of the &NAME Service follows : 
^ ' University Computing Service : Notice by the Director 
^ Public Workstation Facility application / teaching software for the academical year &NUM 
^ This notice is addressed to all those who currently use or who are planning to use the Public Workstation Facility ( &NAME ) , including &NAME &NAME stations , to support their teaching whether for organized courses or for teaching which depends more generally on applications on the &NAME . 
^ Requests for new application software or for new versions of application software are needed by the &NAME Service by the end of Full &NAME &NAME ( Friday , &NUM March &NUM ) . 
^ They should be submitted either by e-mail ( &EMAIL ) or in writing to the &NAME Manager , University Computing Service , &NAME &NAME &NAME . 
^ Software for which requests are received later than this date will not necessarily be installed in time for the start of the &NAME &NAME . 
^ It would also be helpful to be informed of any software that is no longer required . 
^ The list of software which the &NAME Service plans to make available for the start of the &NAME &NAME will be announced on the &NAME Wide Web by the division of the &NAME &NAME . 
^ The programme of installation of the new software will need to start immediately after the end of Full &NAME &NAME , in order that it can be completed by Monday , &NUM September . 
^ This time-scale will enable those , whose teaching depends on these applications , to check that they work correctly and to allow for any necessary remedial action to be taken before the start of the &NAME &NAME . 
^ Those requesting software , whether new applications or upgrades to existing software , are asked to consider the budgetary implications of their requests for themselves and sites . 
^ Those teaching over the period of the Long Vacation should note that the installation of new versions of &NAME software may have implications for them .

^ The educational psychologist 's report recommends that &NAME be allowed to submit his essay &NUM weeks after the exams , but I do n't want him trying to do that at the same time as the project . 
^ What do you think about giving him time after the end of the course for the essay ? 
^ The degree committee meeting is currently set for September &NUM - as long as we have it marked by then , I do n't see any structural problem . 
^ We could ask him to submit by , e.g. , August 29th 
^ - &NAME says she can &NAME it . 
^ I strongly suspect we 'll need to give him extra time for the project too - since this is n't mentioned in the report , I probably ought to discuss it with the college and perhaps ask the psychologist for recommendations . 
^ The college and Board of examinations have agreed a procedure for him taking the exams over &NUM days . 
^ The report recommends that he should not be penalised in the exam for spelling and / or grammar mistakes . 
^ I do n't imagine that any of us would be inclined to do this anyway , but I will ask &NAME to put a note in with the scripts etc. 
^ I have a copy of a fax of the report - we 'll get a proper copy tomorrow or Friday in the post . 
^ He has a number of identifiable problems , most seriously that he has impaired auditory working memory ' - this is leading to comprehension problems . 
^ I will attempt to take account of this when supervising his project .

^ Dear everyone , 
^ My apologies for for the misunderstanding which resulted in &NAME 's email being sent out to everyone inadvertantly . 
^ Fellows and staff email addresses are currently only available on the College intranet . 
^ An email policy is in preparation , &NUM aspect of which will be to ask people for permission to include email addresses on the College internet ( which means they will be accessible to anyone looking at our web site from anywhere in the world ) . 
^ In the meantime , we will NOT be putting anyone 's personal email address on the College internet . 
^ This is entirely separate to the University 's email address directory , which can be searched at : &WEBSITE It also works on the basis of ' opting in ' , which means that someone is only included in the directory if they have given explicit permission . 
^ Thank you .

^ I have &NUM kids ( &NAME , &NUM ; &NAME , &NUM ) and an American wife -- &NAME , who was born in &NAME ( hence the annual rtn ) .

^ I bike to school with &NAME on the crossbar and &NAME on her bike and then on to work every day . 
^ I 've stopped fencing for the moment except with plastic broadswords -- there are signs that at least &NAME will become a keen fancer via this route , but &NAME is going to be a singer , dancer and mummy in that order ' and is already quite genuinely accomplished at &NUM , averagely frighteningly &NUM teen at &NUM , and fastening onto other people 's babies with a vengance -- so probably no room for fencing .

^ What is the problem precisely ? 
^ If it is to categorise the language of documents then I can see that this is a good approach . 
^ However if it is to apply a set of subject categories to multilingual documents then obtaining suitable training data will be a more difficult problem . 
^ You would need a sample of documents about each topic in each language . 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME , Open University , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME : &NUM ( &NUM ) &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE 
^ Both language modeling papers I listed mentioned a simple technique for obtaining training data using a standard search engine such as &NAME i.e. you can simply specify the language of the document to be searched for .

^ &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) : 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ By ' Multilingual &NAME &NAME ' I mean the problem of automatically assigning a category to a document whatever it is the language . 
^ The suggested approach , build separate language models for the different languages , supposes to have a sufficient quantity of texts in each language ( and for each category ) to be able to learn a model . 
^ In the real life this 
^ is not always true . 
^ &NAME , 
^ At &NUM : &NUM &NUM / &NUM / &NUM , you wrote : 
<TEXT_EMBEDDED>

^ Many thanks &NAME . 
^ I 'll put these points to the &NAME . 
^ I know there is a strong view that the time between the WShops and publication of the SI should be short as possible ( without compromising standards ) . 
^ As to number of papers , my guess would be possibly as many &NUM given the status of the meetings , but we could simply restrict it to the &NUM or &NUM for &NUM issue . 
^ Otherwise , all seems well . 
^ I 'll cc send this message to the &NAME for comment .

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I believe that we approached you some time ago to investigate the possibility of a special issue of the Computer Speech & Language journal on &NAME &NUM : The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop ( I 've attached the draft &NAME with more details ) . 
^ ( Given that the &NAME &NAME ' &NUM Workshop will be held in conjunction with &NAME ' &NUM , we might want to consider including papers from both workshops in the special issue . ) I recall you being favorable to our query , although we had not yet formulated a real proposal . 
^ Can you still accommodate us ? 
^ If so , under what parameters / conditions ( e.g. , turn around time , page count , page size , guest editor / &CHAR ) ? 
^ Are you also working under &NAME van der &NAME and , if so , would you like me to ask her about this ? 
^ We published a special issue of &NAME journal using an expedited round-robin review process on the &NAME Speaker &NAME &NAME &NUM that was published as almost &NUM &NAME &NAME ' pages in a triple volume within only a few months . 
^ I think the quality of the papers was reasonably good , although we might have erred on accepting a few too many papers for the special issue and disrupting &NAME 's page quotas for that year . 
^ There was a special issue of Speech Communication on an &NAME predecessor workshop , but that took much longer ( too long ? ) to publish . 
^ I 've included an excerpt from some discussions on these pros and cons and would like to know if you agree with this assessment , especially with respect to &NAME .

^ - ------ Forwarded Message 
^ Apologies for multiple postings . 
^ Call for Papers : 
^ Journal of &NAME &NAME 
^ Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 
^ &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &NAME University , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME , &EMAIL 
^ The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . 
^ It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . 
^ The usefulness of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950's and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . 
^ The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . 
^ This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . 
^ This special issue of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . 
^ Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : 
^ * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . 
^ Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? 
^ How should they be combined ? 
^ Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? 
^ Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? 
^ * Evaluation of &NAME systems . 
^ Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? 
^ Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? 
^ Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? 
^ Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? 
^ * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . 
^ How do these affect &NAME ? 
^ How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? 
^ Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? 
^ What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? 
^ * The effect of &NAME on applications . 
^ To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? 
^ What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? 
^ What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? 
^ * Minimising the need for hand-tagged data . 
^ Hand-tagged text is expensive and difficult to obtain while un-tagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . 
^ What techniques can be used to make use of un-tagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? 
^ What use can be made of parallel text ? 
^ Can un-tagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ?

^ Hi &NAME 
^ Along side my report I 've been doing some work with &NAME . 
^ I grabbed the opportunity to get her software working with mine because when I tried before she was quite busy . 
^ We 've been looking at the contribution a &NAME makes to the speed of learning . 
^ We can run experiments first using my learner on it 's own and then with the with the feedback from &NAME 's &NAME module . 
^ Looks like we 'll get quite a speed up in learning . 
^ Thought this might be interesting in terms of empricism vs. nativism , showing we can learn without a large amounts of innate knowledge but it it takes much longer and possibly too long in terms of the cut off . 
^ We have just noticed there is a conference ( boot-la - &CHAR think ) where this work might fit quite nicely . 
^ Do you think it would a good place to submit something ? 
^ I can ask my college for funds .

^ I am at a loss to understand the recent allegations that there is a shortage of projectors in the lecture theatres . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ OK , one of these were me . 
^ The first time the projector had been moved from the projector stand ( why ? ) and placed in the cupboard underneath . 
^ Now I know this I can look there , but at the time I just struggled on with one . 
^ The second time , some kind soul had removed one into the preparation room ! 
^ Again , it 's simple when one knows all the places they might have been hidden , but at the time it 's easy to believe the ' &NUM has been playing up and has been removed ' thought . 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ I checked this morning and there are : 
^ - In &NAME , &NUM projectors , the correct number 
^ - In &NAME , &NUM projectors , &NUM more than should be there . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ It was n't me who borrowed one , but I can understand the ' I 'm about to lecture and need a second projector but one has disappeared crisis ' . 
^ As a meta-comment to the current issue , I suspect the &NAME projectors get moved because someone using the &NAME projectors finds they get in the way . 
^ A really nice long-term solution is to arrange that the &NUM desks ( on which the projectors sit ) just have a camera ( above or below ) so that images , written in real-time , can be projected onto the &NUM &NAME projectors ...

^ &NAME RESEARCH LECTURE 
^ SPEAKER : &NAME &NAME INSTITUTION : Interview Talk HOST : &NAME &NAME DATE : Tuesday March &NUM , &NUM TIME : &NUM : &NUM - &NUM : &NUM PLACE : &NAME Theatre , &NAME Research Ltd &NUM &CHAR &CHAR &NAME Avenue ( Off &NAME Road ) &NAME TITLE : &NAME : A Variational Inference Engine for &NAME &NAME 
^ In recent years variational methods have become a popular tool for approximate inference and learning in a wide variety of probabilistic models , with applications ranging from bioinformatics to machine vision . 
^ For each new application , however , it is currently necessary first to derive the variational update equations , and then to implement them in application-specific code . 
^ Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone . 
^ In this talk I will give an introduction to variational inference methods and describe a general purpose inference engine called &NAME ( Variational Inference for BayESian Networks ' ) which allows a wide variety of probabilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding . 
^ The talk will include a demo of &NAME being used with a number of different models .

<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ What 's the deadline for the workshop paper ?

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ The workshop deadline is tomorrow , so I think that I 'll submit what I 've got so far , which suggests that the performance of the &NAME and &NAME algorithm is on average only &NUM better when it 's using the &NAME and &NAME parser than when it uses &NAME ' GRs . 
^ ( The performance is significantly better though . )

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ Here are the baseline results for my classifier on the lingspam corpus : 
^ precision for GENUINE : &NUM recall for GENUINE : &NUM 
^ precision for &NAME : &NUM recall for &NAME : &NUM 
^ F1 for GENUINE : &NUM F1 for &NAME : &NUM 
^ There seems to be some confusion in the literature about the exact definitions of precision and recall for the 2-class classification problem . 
^ I define recall as &NUM ( &NAME + FN ) and precision as &NUM ( &NAME + FP ) 
^ where &NAME true positive &NAME false positive &NAME false negative 
^ i.e. recall is measuring the number of correctly classified units for class &CHAR against the number missed , whereas precision is measuring the number of correctly classified units for class &CHAR against the total number of class &CHAR classifications made . 
^ In some of the literature these measurements are the other way around ! 
^ This gives a precision / recall / F1 for each class .

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>

^ This is already standard practice , though they simply type banal headers and do n't bother to model real text statistically . 
^ The point of a statistical approach is that it can always renew / adapt it 's model of spam but needs a good idea of what a genuine email looks like too , esp .

<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ It depends very much on the subject . 
^ For example , I could send you the contents of my ' supervision ' folder , which is full of emails related to supervision organisation . 
^ But that might bias things a bit ( I mean , you might conclude that genuine email is more likely to contain words like ' supervision ' than it actually is ) . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>

^ Bias from any &NUM source is not likely to be a problem as we plan to gather a large corpus -- ideally 250k or so of emails . 
^ &NAME will get in touch about what you might donate -- thanks .

^ I 'm not &NUM convinced that it 's not copyright violation for me to use other people 's emails without asking them .

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>

^ Try it and see for yourself -- copyright is in verbatim text and has to be asserted at the time of dissemination . 
^ Nevertheless , you are right that there is an issue of privacy , so you shld not submit anything that you think your friends would object to once anonymised .

^ It might make things better if people can anonymise their mail BEFORE sending it to you ( rather than trust that you 're not accidentally reading the original version ) .

<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ It might be quicker just to look at lots of &NAME threads or something like that ( I think , at the moment , any thread that is ' big ' is not likely to be spam , although it 's theoretically possible that spammers will reply to real threads ) .

^ You might be interested in some initial results ( the test set is &NUM genuine emails and &NUM spam ) :

^ For the spam emails :

^ &NUM &NUM classified as GENUINE 
^ A reasonably good starting point I think - plenty of room for improvement , but relatively high success at classifying genuine email is encouraging , as that is perhaps the most safety-critical aspect . 
^ I have n't studied the spam results in detail yet , but I suspect many of the misclassifications are due to the fact that I am only classifying the body text at the moment , and many of the training spam emails only contain a subject and perhaps a web-link or something in the body .

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ What do you mean with ' plain document ' ? 
^ You can write quite a lot of formats with word . 
^ If ' plain ' means ASCII-text with linefeeds , you can simply write a perl script like 
^ while ( ( ) ) { chomp ; print ' ( line ) ' ; print $ _ ; print ' ( /line)n ' ; 
^ You can also load your document with &NAME and save in &NAME 's native format -- it will be &NAME then , but the markup is probably not what you need .

^ Hey &NAME , 
^ I guess you looked at the website right ? 
^ Making the corpus ( body of email data ) available to the academic community means just that ! 
^ The idea is that the anonymisation procedure removes any references to real people / places / organisations / locations etc. and then the corpus is used as a benchmark training and testing resource for academics doing research into the junk email classification problem . 
^ That means that they will use computers to generate statistical probabilities of certain words appearing at certain places in emails , and then use these to classify new emails as either genuine or junk . 
^ Having a corpus that multiple people test systems on is vital for reproducibility of experiments , etc. 
^ Do n't worry - noone as seen any of the emails you let me use . 
^ ( Obviously I did n't use any of the &NUM from &NAME , etc. anyway ! ) The idea of the website is to convince people that it is safe to use the emails they donated as part of this corpus because it will be impossible to tell where the emails came from , where they were sent to , who they were about , etc. etc. 
^ But this will only happen with explicit permission from the donor , and if you 're not happy about yours being used in that way , then that 's fine ! 
^ It 's still been really useful for me to use them thus far . 
^ Speak soon ,

^ I am chairing a workshop &NUM July &NUM , after &NAME &NUM ( &NAME ) intended to address questions related to multilingual NE recognition and reusability of statistical and symbolic methods across languages . 
^ I encourage you and ( and others ) to submit a paper to the workshop and / or to attend it . 
^ Here 's the relevant info ( website to be up by &NUM January , and an official &NAME to go out via the customary channels : tentative submission deadline &NUM March &NUM ) . 
^ ( Note : &NAME is providing some travel funds , to help defray expenses for students . ) 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME Natural Language Group Title and description : Multilingual and Mixed-language Named &NAME &NAME : &NAME &NAME and Symbolic Models 
^ Organizing Committee : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME 
^ Description : Named Entity ( NE ) Recognition systems vary widely , from high-speed bulk methods optimized for indexing , to deep semantic parsers tuned for specific domains . 
^ Optimal ways to combine statistical and symbolic models also vary , depending on applications and tasks . 
^ Is it possible to 
^ - maximize use of knowledge-rich resources ( e.g. lexicons , NE grammars , parsing ) while permitting corpus-based training for domain or language ? 
^ - acquire and share resources ( including lexicons and grammars ) across languages ? 
^ - balance performance speed with reasonable accuracy ? 
^ - use specific language patterns while permitting rapid transfer to another language ? 
^ - minimize variability in results across language types ? 
^ We welcome research on combined models , in which these tradeoffs are calculated in particular ways . 
^ We hope that the workshop will bring together work on robust and deep multilingual and mixed language NE recognition from different perspectives . 
^ Possible topics include 
^ - the role of the lexicon vs. dynamic processing information 
^ - grammars and lexicons shared ( or ported ) across languages -acquisition of multilingual resources ( e.g. from corpora ) -translating NEs across multiple languages 
^ - domain tuning 
^ Papers may cover &NUM or more of these ( or related ) areas . 
^ Demonstrations of implemented NE systems are also welcome .

^ Hello list members , My Ph. &NAME thesis is to be on named entity recognition for Norwegian . 
^ I want to use existing programming tools implementing different statistical methods . 
^ Most of my reading has been on maximum entropy modelling . 
^ Do any of you have any experience with existing tools that can be used for named entity recognition ? 
^ Ideally I would like to be able to experiment with the kind of information provided to the system , so I want open source code that can be modified . 
^ In the case of maximum entropy modelling I would appreciate the possibility of trying different algorithms . 
^ It would be an extra bonus if I could try out the frequency redistibution algorithm advocated by &NAME . 
^ I intend to post a summary of the comments received . 
^ I appreciate your help .

^ &NAME : Experiments on the Automatic Induction of German Verb Classes 
^ Speaker : &NAME &NAME im &NAME - University of &NAME 
^ &NAME : 
^ The verb is central to the structure and the meaning of a sentence , so available lexical resources on verb knowledge represent an important means for Natural Language Processing applications . 
^ This talk focuses on the automatic induction of verb classes : a clustering methodology is developed which utilises the relationship between verb meaning components and verb behaviour to provide a classification of German verbs . 
^ In the first part of the talk , I describe the acquisition of lexical syntactic and semantic verb properties from an unsupervised trained statistical grammar model . 
^ The properties are used to define German verbs on &NUM levels of verb description , purely syntactic frame types , prepositional phrase information and selectional preferences . 
^ In the second part of the talk , I describe the adjustment of the standard clustering algorithm k-Means to the task of inducing semantic verb classes from the various verb descriptions . 
^ The clustering parameters , clustering evaluation and clustering results are interpreted and discussed .

^ If anyone can help on the day , mainly presiding but la ying out pistes etc as well , please just turn up . 
^ Start time will be around 
^ &NUM 30am . 
^ All help will be greatly appreciated and more importantly needed . 
^ As a postscript the consensus is for a meeting to discuss the future of the club . 
^ I think possibly the last week of March would be good . 
^ Week commenc ing 24th . 
^ Please would people email availability that week so the meeting can be arranged .

^ the &NAME in &NAME seems to go wrong , possibly when there 's no tree . 
^ in the stuff below ( from /usr / groups / corpora / trec8qa / parses3 / q2 ) there should be a ( &CHAR ) before the ( ' &NAME etc and the ( S) ( &NUM ) after it is also bogus .

^ I have a suggestion for a streamlined book reviewing procedure -- add my addr to the inside front cover as the addr for publishers to send review copies with a note that unsolicited books not appropriate for review will not be returned . 
^ I 'll handle the reviewing process up to the point where I have an acceptable review ( as outlined in the previous email ) . 
^ Then I 'll send it to &NAME , if you like cced to you or someone in &NAME . 
^ After that you and &NAME can take over wrt publication issue , proofing , production etc 
^ That way , we 'll reduce &NAME 's load and I wo n't waste my time sending her emails she apparently loses , or farting about with her spreadsheets recording who is reviewing what etc. I will , of course , keep track here of who is reviewing what , and it would be nice if &NAME cld manage to pay the surface mail costs of forwarding books ( e.g. via an annual bill from our accnts dept. )

^ For the attention of the library committee : 
^ There has been a request at the SSCOM for out-of-hours access to the library by students . 
^ The initial request is believed to be from Diploma students , but there is a feeling that this is likely to be the thin end of the wedge . 
^ In order to guide the library committee in deciding the policy , I have been asked by the &NAME to write a note about the technical and administrative issues involved . 
^ Access control to the &NAME and major areas within it is controlled by electronic locks operated by cards . 
^ There are &NUM types of cards and associated reader : 
^ - The ' &NAME ' cards read by proximity readers 
^ - The University card , read by &NAME ' swipe ' readers 
^ At present , students on taught courses other than the &NAME are NOT issued with &NAME cards ; they only have University cards . 
^ Just &NUM doors are fitted with &NAME readers alongside the &NAME readers : student entrance , &NUM door to &NAME , and &NUM door to the west terrace . 
^ Therefore as things stand we cannot straightforwardly offer card access to the library for &NAME and Diploma students . 
^ Possible solutions if we wish to do so are : 
^ &NUM Extend the ' unlocked ' hours . 
^ All of the electronic doors can be put on a time schedule , which can be quite complex . 
^ It is quite straightforward to extend the hours that the doors are unlocked , giving access to anybody who can get into the building . 
^ This could in principle be combined with paying somebody to supervise the library . 
^ &NUM Equip the &NUM doors on the route to the library with &NAME readers . 
^ This will have a capital cost ( it needs more than just the reader ) and it may be difficult to conceal the new wiring in the existing 
^ walls neatly . 
^ It will also take time to organise . 
^ &NUM &NAME all students with &NAME cards , which would allow us fine-grained control over the access each could have . 
^ Although superficially attractive , it is precisely what we wanted to avoid when we took the decision to install &NAME support alongside &NAME . 
^ There would be some cost in supplying the physical cards , but this is small in comparison with the administrative burden of issuing cards , handling lost cards etc. The Continuum system is such that the card handling procedures have not been as easy to automate as we had hoped , and a significant amount of Computer Officer time is required to deal with them . 
^ &NUM As &NUM , but restrict the card issue to individuals who make a good case for it - a ' sticky door ' policy . 
^ This is predicated on the assumption that relatively few students are likely to wish to use the library out of hours in practice . 
^ The danger is that many would apply ' just in case ' , or in the mistaken belief that the card would give access to the rest of the building . 
^ We could consider discouraging this by charging a deposit , but it might be hard to justify this being more than the replacement value of the card - under &pound; &NUM - a relatively trivial sum .

^ Re this extraordinary stuff from the &NAME - &NUM min breakdown no non-examined lectures 
^ is * anybody * in the &NAME resisting this sort of crap ? 
^ &NAME may think they are promoting better higher education but what they are actually doing is destroying it . 
^ ( or shd one just be cynical and tell lies , or waffle on about the fact that any material in any lecture can be some sort of prerequisite / background for some exam question in the sense that knowing it will support better motivated answers to the actual questions asked . ... ) 
^ I am saddened by the fact that , going through slides of some of &NAME 's talks , it 's clear that though they give the very solid framework , what he actually said was what mattered ; and while he certainly had more detailed notes for undergraduate lecturing , the idea that what he said as opposed to what the students were supplied in written form with was &NAME ornament or reiteration is really lowering . 
^ And I bet that the more you go the &NAME cut and dried route the less likely you are as a lecturer to be remembered &NUM or &NUM years later , as I have had messages saying about &NAME .

^ Obviously if &NUM person ( or more ! 
^ there 's not only you and &NAME ! ) goes away , their tasks have to be replaced and that will inevitably mean sharing out some of the burden among the rest of us . 
^ I am concerned because some people are already working beyond reasonable capacity . 
^ This is a real issue as &NAME has a history of people being overworked and then off sick . 
^ Even if we were to get a fractional appt , which is what I will argue for , that still leaves admin tasks to be shared out , because temporary fractional appointments will not be expert admin people ! . 
^ They wo n't be likely to be able to carry the kind of burden that more experienced colleagues can . 
^ That makes it all the more difficult to alter the &NAME role along the lines agreed by all of us . 
^ And a fractiuonal appointment is likely to be for less than a semester / year . 
^ In your case , I had hoped that you could have taken on rather more in your year tutor role , as 2nd year tutor is one of the admin jobs that hitherto has not been hugely demanding . 
^ I was hoping that we could institute a new , better , fairer system for teaching and admin that would give us all research time , including sabbaticals on a rota ( rather than a ' competetive ' basis ) . 
^ But getting such a system in place is a team effort and takes time . 
^ It 's going to be much harder to do that if people are away . 
^ There is also the question of the &NAME replacement - applying for sabbatical leave is making a powerful statement about being out of the running for that . 
^ I personally would rather the &NAME issue were dealt with before sabbaticals were considered . 
^ It 's all very complicated , and so I can only say that you should do what you feel you have to do . 
^ There 's an inevitable tension between personal interest and team interest , but fortunately it will be up to the &NAME committee to decide about research leave , and not up to me . 
^ Sorry &NUM cannot be of more concrete help &NAME . 
^ shell xx 
^ &NAME , I thought you were . 
^ &ORG , I 've been trying to reach you on the phone this am but you are busy , busy , busy . 
^ I thought you were meeting with &NAME and &NAME today to discuss , amongst other things , the sabbatical situation . 
^ Or is this just in my head ( somehow the 18th has stuck in my brain as an imp . 
^ date ) . 
^ I really would like to discuss this situation with you . 
^ If I want to be able to do this plan in &NAME , I will need to set wheels in motion - the logistics are endless . 
^ Incidentally , I still have not heard back from &NAME regarding my original email , though I did write to her to that effect about &NUM days ago ( message also not acknoweldged ) . 
^ Though she and &NAME both told me I should go for the round of readerships in the university in June , by her not responding to my precise questions surrounding this , I do wonder how much she really is behind me .

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ Unfortunately , a second presenter , &NAME &NAME , has also had to cancel due to illness . 
^ There will , therefore , be major changes to the proposed programme . 
^ &NAME &NAME , &NAME in Politics at &NAME University , and I will be taking the place of &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME .

^ If you ca n't do this , can you please send me their email addresses and I will contact them directly myself . 
^ I will also need to revise some of the materials for the packs . 
^ Ideally it would be wonderful if you could make copies of the revised materials and give them to &NAME ; if you ca n't do this , and I know you are already stretched , please let me know and I will take them to Staples here in &NAME .

^ To &NAME &NAME : 
^ I wanted to express my support for what you 've written . 
^ I could n't have expressed it better , but your letter echoes my own reaction to the initial past presidents ' letter . 
^ I 'm a bit confused by Ad &NAME 's letter , disagreeing with you having apparently said that ' an academic boycott is hence something that should not be debated by institutions like the &NAME . ' 
^ On the contrary : your letter states , ' As members of an academic association in this country , it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour . 
^ It is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate . ' 
^ I take it , then , that you agree with Ad &NAME , who says ' I think we all have the intellectual responsibility to debate exactly these issues . ' 
^ Thank you for furthering this debate and pointing out some subtleties involved in the issue in question .

^ The problem is that taking them into account , which we 'd be fools not to , will make the squib longer not shorter .

^ What you suggest , have a smaller piece in &NAME as a pointer to the larger squib in &NAME , may still make perfect sense , the only question is what ground should be covered in this 1k review , do you see it essentially as a precis of the squib , or do you think it should concentrate on other points , such as the &NUM you bought up ?

^ WORKSHOP ON ADAPTIVE TEXT EXTRACTION AND MINING ( ATEM-03 ) ( plus introductory TUTORIAL ) 
^ at the 14th European Conference on &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) and 7th European Conference on Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in &NAME ( &NAME ) 
^ &NUM September &NUM [ tentative ] &NAME ( &NAME ) 
^ Important facts : 
^ - submission due : &NUM June &NUM 
^ - Web page : &WEBSITE 
^ MOTIVATION Vast quantities of valuable knowledge are embedded in unstructured textual formats . 
^ &NAME of text are currently available on the public Web , in intranets and other private repositories , and on our personal desktop machines . 
^ In many cases , the only way to access such documents is through blunt instruments such as keyword-based document retrieval . 
^ In recent years , there has been significant research ( and considerable commercial interest ) in technologies for automatically extracting and mining useful structured knowledge from unstructured text . 
^ Current trends suggest a movement away from pure natural language processing approaches requiring the manual development of rules , to a shallower , less knowledge intensive techniques based on techniques from machine learning , information retrieval and data mining . 
^ Adaptive text extraction and mining is an enabling technology with a wide variety of applications . 
^ On the Web , automated knowledge capture from text would open the way for both better retrieval , and advanced business applications ( e.g. B2B / B2C applications mediated by knowledge-aware agents ) . 
^ For knowledge management , capturing the knowledge contained in a companys repositories would encourage knowledge to be shares and reused among employees , improving efficiency and competitiveness . 
^ Extracting information from texts is an important step in capturing knowledge , e.g. for populating databases or ontologies , supporting document &NAME ( e.g. for the Semantic Web ) , for learning ontologies , etc. 
^ THE WORKSHOP The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from different communities ( e.g. machine learning , text mining , natural language processing , information extraction , information retrieval , ontology learning ) to discuss recent results and trends in mining texts for knowledge capture . 
^ Members of other communities ( e.g. information integration and data mining ) could find the workshop very interesting as well . 
^ Previous workshops on the use of machine learning for information extraction were held at &ORG-1998 , ECAI-2000 , and IJCAI-2001 . 
^ AREAS OF INTEREST Areas of interest for the workshop include ( but are not limited to ) : 
^ * machine learning and natural language 
^ * learning to annotate documents 
^ * ontology learning 
^ * information retrieval and learning 
^ * information integration from textual and multimedia resources 
^ * relevant aspects of human-computer interaction and semi-supervised learning 
^ SUBMISSION DETAILS ATEM-2003 will accept &NUM types of submissions : long papers that describe completed research ( maximum &NUM pages ) ; and short papers that describe ongoing work or challenging ideas ( maximum &NUM pages ) . 
^ The most interesting papers presented at the workshop will be considered for a special issue of a scientific journal . 
^ Manuscripts should be formatted for &NAME paper , and must be submitted in either &NAME or Postscript format . 
^ Send submissions to ' &WEBSITE ' with the subject ' &NAME submission ' . 
^ IMPORTANT DATES Please note the following deadlines : 
^ - Paper submission deadline : Friday &NUM June &NUM 
^ - Paper acceptance notification : Friday &NUM July &NUM 
^ - Paper camera-ready deadline : Friday &NUM July &NUM 
^ - &NAME date : Monday &NUM September &NUM [ tentative ] 
^ JOINT TUTORIAL Researchers who are interested but not yet involved in adaptive text extraction and mining are encouraged to attend the tutorial ' Information Extraction from Web Documents ' at &ORG-2003 . 
^ This introductory tutorial has been organized by the workshop chairs to complement the research focus of ATEM-2003 . 
^ SPONSORSHIP The workshop will be partly funded by a grant from the European Project ' &WEBSITE ' .

^ I wonder if you could do me a quick favour to make sure that I do n't lose my &NAME email account during my year out ? 
^ &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) would just like a short note to confirm that I need my email account for academic purposes . 
^ I 'm doing some travelling now and expect to come &NAME to graduate early next year . 
^ My college gave me a prize for my performance on the &NAME course , which was a nice surprise ! 
^ I hope all 's well with the new &NAME bunch . 
^ All the best , &NAME 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ &NAME , To keep your accounts for longer than a &NUM month period you will need to get authorisation sent to us ( an e-mail will be fine ) from your department , stating that you will be using your account for academic purposes .

^ Thanks &NAME , that 's absolutely fantastic . 
^ At some point in the future we are hoping to make publicly available an anonymised corpus for standardised testing of email filtering . 
^ Would you be happy for your ( anonymised ) data to be included in this corpus ? 
^ Thanks again - your contribution will make a big difference to my project and I hope to the advancement of this field .

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>

^ hmm , looking at a folder on PINE , it appears to be &NAME , which is the standard &NAME mail folder format , so I 'll use that . 
^ My e-mail client is &NAME ( &WEBSITE ) but there are scripts to convert between almost any e-mail folder format to any other . 
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ In terms of numbers , between &NUM would be ideal . 
^ Genuine mailing list emails are also useful because it 's mostly text-analysis that we 're interested in. 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>

^ I created a folder containing &NUM e-mails from a variety of sources . 
^ It was 47Mb , so I compressed it with &NAME and uploaded it to &WEBSITE If you want something smaller , I 'm sure you could run a script over it to strip out all attachments . 
^ &NAME this is useful !

^ &NAME , 
^ at long last I seem to be making progress towards getting a publisher . 
^ It turns out for some reason Festschrifts are generally poor sellers , so one has to do it but not place the emphasis on that . 
^ Could you give me your opinion about the feasability of holding some sort of conference or meeting in &NAME on or around the relevant date - &NUM August &NUM . 
^ It might be an idea sound &NAME out about this and to check the date - I 'm working off Who 's Who , but mistakes are always possible . . ... at the same time ask him about whether there is any chance of getting &NAME &NAME to contribute a preface page - this would make the whole thing enormously more attractive to publishers . 
^ Is this OK ? 
^ I 'm also going to circulate the group about whether the book should be published prior to the date of a meeting .

^ Dear Fellows We have a Fellows ' photograph album in the &NAME . 
^ In the past every new Fellow has been asked to submit a photograph for it . 
^ The album has proved very useful for new Fellows in identifying old &NUM , and for old Fellows in identifying new &NUM . 
^ It also provides lots of amusement . 
^ When a Fellow leaves , the photograph goes into the archive - for ever . 
^ We are often asked by press and publishers for copies of such photographs , and indeed they expect us always to have them . 
^ Unfortunately , in recent years , Fellows have been very bad at responding to the request for a photo , and I believe also that in the last year or &NUM the responsibility for making the request has fallen between &NUM stools . 
^ As a result the photograph album is losing both its usefulness and its entertainment value . 
^ I am also aware that a number of Fellows will be leaving shortly and we shall have no photographic record at all . 
^ THIS MESSAGE IS A PLEA FOR A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU - if you know we do n't have one already . 
^ The convention used to be for a studio portrait ( one of the reasons we stopped getting them , I suspect ) ; however , we should be happy to accept anything , however snappy . 
^ If sending as a jpeg is easier , then so be it . 
^ Please send your photograph to me as soon as possible , and thank you in advance for your co-operation in contributing to &NAME 's historical record .

<MESSAGE_BODY>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ &NAME , 
^ I 've finally managed to finish the review of the &NAME book , which &NAME handed down to me . 
^ Sorry it took an extra &NUM weeks than expected , but a bunch of things came up right at the time I had planned to do it ... 
^ Anyway , I 'm attaching it to this message . 
^ Let me know if you need anything else , or if something is n't quite right . 
^ Also , since this is my first book review , feel free to let me know if I have n't adequately done the job ! 
^ Cheers , &NAME 
^ &NAME &NAME , editor . 
^ &NAME : Foundations of Speech-to-Speech Translation . 
^ &NAME . 
^ &NUM . 
^ &NAME &NUM . 
^ &NAME &NUM pounds ( hardback ) . 
^ xii+679 pages . 
^ &NAME was a project for speech-to-speech translation that lasted &NUM years and encompassed &NUM research groups , primarily in &NAME . 
^ The original goal was to develop a portable translation system for German and English for the domains of appointment scheduling and travel planning . 
^ Later , translation between German and Japanese was added and both a telephone translation system and a remote maintenance system for &NAME were developed . 
^ This book contains &NUM articles , grouped into &NUM sections , which address various aspects of the &NAME project . 
^ The title is somewhat misleading , as the phrase ' foundations of speech-to-speech translation ' seems to imply that the book will be instructive with respect to the task , or at least contain comprehensive high-level discussion about it . 
^ Instead , most articles of the book report on specific components and approaches developed and utilized to support speech-to-speech translation in &NAME . 
^ This is fine , but readers should be aware that the book is in no way a textbook ; background knowledge relevant to the individual topics is assumed by the authors of most articles . 
^ Having said this , if the term ' foundations ' is taken to mean consideration of all the various kinds of data , components , techniques , etc. that could take part in performing the task , then the articles of the book certainly cover the ground extensively . 
^ The articles themselves vary in their focus and emphasis . 
^ The stated goals of &NAME were essentially oriented toward producing an end application , and this course provided an excellent setting for a considerable amount of research to be done . 
^ Thus , some articles could be roughly characterized as ' here is how we made it work ' , while others could be captioned as ' here is this interesting thing we did within the scope of the project ' . 
^ As such , there is material of interest for both academically and commercially oriented readers . 
^ Throughout the book , there is a strong emphasis on producing modules that can perform their computations in real-time , and with such a large number of different technologies applied in &NAME , this should be of interest to those interested in developing various kinds of practical &NAME systems . 
^ With all the different topics covered , much more high level discussion of how the various bits and modules fit together would have been very welcome , including ( even brief ) overviews of the different sections explaining , basically , what the different articles are about and why they are there . 
^ Such overviews also could have provided a forum for more meta-level discussion on how well the different approaches and strategies worked out . 
^ It would also have been useful to have a map of the system with pointers to the articles where the relevant modules are discussed ; it is sometimes hard to tell what depended on what from just reading the articles , and it is often necessary to cross-reference several articles to properly situate them within the context of the overall system . 
^ The articles are too numerous and diverse in specialization to comment on each one individually in a short review by &NUM reviewer ; however , I will try to give an overall sense of the book 's contents in the remainder of this review . 
^ The first section contains &NUM articles that provide an overview of the completed &NAME system and facts and figures about the project itself . 
^ The overview is quite useful for getting a feeling for the system as a whole before launching into the articles on the specifics . 
^ It provides very high-level descriptions of some of the various components and how they fit together , as well as general discussion regarding the scope of the task which was undertaken , the data collection effort , and software architecture . 
^ It concludes by summarizing some of the lessons learned over the course of the project ; unfortunately , only &NUM pages are devoted to this , when in fact it seems that it would be worthy of its own chapter . 
^ Also , the overview clearly stays focused on the successes of &NAME , whereas it would be very beneficial for the reader , whether research or application oriented , to also hear about the problems that were encountered and the things that did not go so well . 
^ The next section contains &NUM articles that deal with topics in processing spoken input , with all its messy details , and transforming it into representations that can be processed by the syntax , semantics , and translation components . 
^ The first half of the section is concerned with the methodologies and techniques for speech recognition , covering topics such as language identification , providing robustness in the face of various noise conditions , optimizations for improving the efficiency of speech recognition components , and investigations into new techniques for capturing long range dependencies in language modeling . 
^ The latter articles report on the creation of pronunciation dictionaries from data to provide variants for canonical pronunciations , the &NAME and classification of prosodic information , detection of emotional behavior by users , and the detection and correction of speech repairs as a filter process between recognition and subsequent processing stages . 
^ The third section is the largest -- it includes &NUM articles addressing lexical and syntactic processing . 
^ &NUM different approaches to parsing were developed and integrated : a robust chunk parser built from a cascade of finite state transducers , a probabilistic &NAME parser , and an optimized &NAME &NAME &NAME Grammar ( &NAME ) parser . 
^ These approaches , which are each discussed in separate articles , provided the means to balance robustness with accuracy and depth of syntactic analysis . 
^ There is also a further , brief article describing how their results were combined . 
^ While the &NAME parser provides full semantic analyses , the chunk parser and &NAME parser produce only syntactic trees ; how interpretations are read from these trees is discussed in an article on semantic construction . 
^ The use of a &NAME syntactic framework such as &NAME required considerable justification in the face of the cost of developing grammars and efficient parsing techniques , the third section contains an article that lays out some of the arguments for using &NAME over other available frameworks and answers some of the concerns regarding the efficiency and complexity of having deep analysis as such at all . 
^ &NUM further articles describe aspects of the &NAME grammars which were developed for German , English , and Japanese . 
^ Since the results of the &NUM parsers need to be integrated into a single interpretation for further processing , it was necessary to develop a standard interface representation that abstracted from the particularities of each of the approaches . 
^ For this , &NAME &NAME Terms ( &NAME ) were developed and employed , and are motivated and described in detail in the fourth article in this section . 
^ &NAME provide an underspecified , flat representation that permits many different kinds of information about an utterance to be stored and accessed , including basic predications , scope constraints , sorts , discourse relations , syntactic features , tense and aspect , and prosody . 
^ The final article of this section describes the multilingual lexical databases that were developed and highlights some of the issues in dealing with the morphology of the different languages and ensuring that it was possible to retrieve translation equivalents from &NUM language to the other for the semantic transfer translation component . 
^ There are &NUM articles on aspects of semantic processing in the fourth section . 
^ The first discusses how the analyses produced by the &NUM different parsers were combined to produce a single semantic output , and the second deals with processing the intermediate &NAME hypotheses of the parsers in robust manner that corrects certain recognition errors and disfluencies in the semantic output of each parser . 
^ The next paper focuses on how some of the non-local ambiguities in &NAME were resolved by incorporating discourse and prosodic information . 
^ The rule-based module employed for this handled aspects such as verb and adverb disambiguation , anaphora and ellipsis resolution , and focus projection . 
^ The final article in this section relates how the semantic databases were designed to support multiple languages and ensure that they map material in a given source language to comparable semantic relations in &NAME to assist in semantic transfer translation . 
^ In the fifth section , we come to descriptions of the actual translation engines employed in &NAME . 
^ &NUM main approaches were explored : semantic transfer , statistical translation , substring-based translation , case-based translation , and dialog-act based translation . 
^ The different engines tackled the problem in significantly different ways that gave them , in some cases , complementary strengths and weaknesses . 
^ Echoing the multi-engine approach to parsing discussed earlier , the translations ultimately produced by the &NAME system were chosen from those created by these different modules , based on the confidence values they assigned to their outputs . 
^ The sixth section contains &NUM articles which address the recognition , representation and use of discourse information within the system . 
^ The first article explicates the representation of dialog , including illocutionary force , propositional content , and temporal expressions , and the following article discusses how dialog structures are produced for the purposes of both context-sensitive translation and producing multilingual summaries of the dialogs mediated by &NAME . 
^ The final article describes the module which performs contextual disambiguation using the variety of sources of information built up during the ' deep processing ' path in &NAME and which plays a role in semantic transfer translation . 
^ The seventh section deals with sentence realization and speech synthesis . 
^ First to be discussed is the &NAME generation component , which takes the &NAME output by the semantic transfer translation module and determines how they should be expressed . 
^ After a &NAME is fully specified , it is handed to &NUM syntactic realization components , one which uses &NAME Grammar ( &NAME ) and another which uses &NAME . 
^ The grammars for the former realizer are compiled from the English and Japanese &NAME grammars discussed earlier ; the HPSG-to-TAG compilation process is the subject of the second article in this section . 
^ The next article deals with the creation of dialog minutes and summaries , a useful task which crucially relies on the dialog processing component described in the previous section and the generation component covered in this one . 
^ The final article discusses the concept-to-speech synthesis component used for producing the final spoken output of the system . 
^ The articles in the eighth section describe various aspects of the data collection and corpus creation efforts and evaluation and analysis of different components of &NAME . 
^ These include information about recording , transcription , treebanking , and analysis of the data utilized to develop the &NAME system . 
^ &NUM articles provide evaluations of the speech recognition and synthesis components and the quality of the different translation paths . 
^ These evaluations were carried out at different sites from those which produced the modules , which was certainly of particular importance for the translation evaluation which involved &NUM competing approaches . 
^ There is a further article on a module which attempts to select the best output from one of the translation modules based on the confidence values they produce ; this article might have been better situated in the fourth section of the book , especially since it provides some higher level discussion of the different translation approaches . 
^ Finally , the &NUM articles in the ninth section deal with concerns of software architecture and integration . 
^ Since &NAME involved &NUM research groups with scientists and programmers with varying competencies with respect to programming skills and knowledge of software engineering , it was no small task to coordinate the components that were produced at the individual sites and enable them to work together as a whole . 
^ A special group was devoted to this task , and the article on their effort provides an informative look at the technical ( and sociological ) issues which were overcome in this integration . 
^ The other article describes how &NAME was extended to provide telephone translation services . 
^ &NAME tackled all sorts of problems on all sorts of fronts , resulting in an impressive and extensive body of work that led to &NUM scientific publications and &NUM spin-off products . 
^ The project 's funding and activities provided an immense boost for computational linguistics research and development in &NAME . 
^ This book provides significant insight into the project , and it will be useful to researchers and commercial developers who are interested in specific aspects of speech-to-speech translation and how they fit within the context of an overall system for translation . 
^ The articles are so diverse that it is hard to imagine any single person reading all of the articles contained in the collection since only a subset of them are likely to be of particular interest to any given reader ; nonetheless , it will certainly be an excellent resource for anyone who is specifically interested in &NAME itself and can use it to quickly find information on all the modules in &NUM big handy volume .

^ This workshop clearly falls within the scope of &NAME and my initial reaction to your email is very positive . 
^ To move forwards , we need more information 
^ &CHAR ) We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed - preferably &NUM . 
^ &CHAR ) We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you . 
^ I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop . 
^ You then need to give them time to produce the full paper , send it out to referees , allow revisions , final review and accept . 
^ ( This looks to me like 4th quarter &NUM or 1st quarter &NUM ) 
^ &CHAR ) A single issue of &NAME will accommodate &NUM or &NUM papers . 
^ To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue . 
^ How many papers do you anticipate accepting ?

^ Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to &NAME . 
^ Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by &NUM independent reviewers .

^ But perhaps the bad tokenization was interacting because I think it 's not as frequent as it was in the other file I was looking at .

^ &NAME - 
^ There was a slight confusion in your original message . 
^ Having studied as an undergraduate at &NAME does not mean that the student meets the residence requirement for the PhD . 
^ However , it does indicate that he is a &NAME graduate , and so could submit for a PhD under the special regulations , which would be much more appropriate for someone who was effectively external . 
^ You could advise him as you intended , but he would not have to pay any fees apart from a modest examination &NAME when he had published an appropriate amount of work .

^ &NAME Council wish to put on the record that their intention is not to a ssert 
^ ownership of copyright in lecture notes or books except where explicitly 
^ agreed as part of a commissioning process , for example as might occur for the 
^ creation of material for e-learning.94 
^ The Head of Department interpreted this to mean that the authors of mater ial 
^ which is explicitly commissioned would have to agree to the commissioning and 
^ the transfer of copyright . 
^ As far as he was aware , no such commissioned 
^ material for teaching under the Syndicate 's jurisdiction had been produ ced . 
^ It was his belief that if the Syndicate felt that there was a case for 
^ material to be commissioned , for example for an e-learning course , then he 
^ would consult the Department before proceeding . 
^ He suggested that ' license to use ' rather than copyright transfer would then be a more appropriate approach . 
^ Following further discussion , Professor &NAME reiterated that the position 
^ was clear : copyright remained firmly in the hands of the author . 
^ &NUM Calculators for use in &NAME The currently approved calculator had been discontinued and its replacement 
^ had features that were a cause of concern to the Board of Examinations . 
^ The Teaching Committee had considered the matter and the Syndicate accepted their 
^ recommendation that they would accept any calculator that satisfies the various Natural Science and Engineering committees . 
^ &NUM Membership of the Degree Committee Dr &NAME 's impending promotion to Professor entitled him to serve ex officio 
^ on the Degree Committee thus creating a vacancy for &CHAR co-opted member .

^ the Chairman of the &NAME &NAME Committee , for &NUM year from &NUM January to &NUM December &NUM .

^ thanks I saw it earlier today . 
^ for some odd reason this looks almost identical to ANOTHER earlier &NAME : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ also organised by the same people ( I think ) . 
^ ( I 've been asked to review for it and got that old &NAME + lutz stuff to do ) 
^ I could rehash some of that &NAME stuff , but I think it would be sexier to do something on co-training instead ( this can be thought of as similar to &NAME , but in a more constrained setting , so more likely to work ) . 
^ we 've got a paper at this year 's eacl on it ( and also &NUM at naacl too ) if you 'd like to read more about it . 
^ btw , as part of my fast-track grant I promised to add maxent parse selection to the &NAME / &NAME . 
^ for a variety of reasons , the student wo n't be able to do it . 
^ but , I could devote some time to it .

^ Aims & Scope of GRAMMARS : 
^ GRAMMARS is an international forum for the dissemination of high-level original research in the intersection between mathematical / computational linguistics and formal language theory . 
^ The journal is based on the fact that a certain gap exists between linguists---trying to find adequate formal tools for natural language description and computer scientists---often unconcerned with the descriptive applicability of the generative devices they design . 
^ The aim of the journal is to bring both communities together and to provide a platform for discussion .

^ But there is a problem with the &NAME test of too many &NUM in the slices , as your &NAME paper points out &NAME . 
^ For example , in the &NAME and &NAME comparison only words with a frequency of &NUM or more ( in the joint corpus ) had few enough &NUM for the test to be applicable . 
^ This means that one of the word types in the joint corpus were omitted from the comparison . 
^ But if there is n't enough data we should n't be drawing any inferences , so that seems right . 
^ A name or technical term that gets used lots of times , but in only &NUM or &NUM documents , is not good for basing any inferences on .

^ I propose to do nothing about this , on the following basis : 
^ &NUM ) The letter is not to us and does n't ask us to do anything . 
^ &NUM ) &NAME 's dissertation was read by the ext . 
^ examiner and his oral was attended by him too . 
^ This is our standard practice wrt borderline candidates . 
^ &NUM ) The ext . 
^ examiner can recommend changes to int . 
^ examiners ' marks . 
^ &NUM ) Having the ext . 
^ examiner read all the dissertations , as opposed to a sample and all the borderline &NUM , would seriously increase the workload ( unnnecessarily ) and consequently make it hard to recruit any ext . 
^ examiner . 
^ Have I missed something ( other than the general zeitgeist , which I think is best resisted ) ?

^ I figured out I would go ahead with the ' C181 MERGERS / ACQUISITIONS ' topic code but did n't know where to find the relevant files in the huge corpus as the files had &WEBSITE ' ( these did contain some code info ) .

^ * &NAME of the Product ( suggest easy on the consultancy . 
^ Naturally , there will be implementation , best practice assessment etc - which we know will be the cash cow in the short term etc. Never mention costs , daily rates should only be discounted under extreme conditions and never mentioned up front ) 
^ * Simple Example ( possibly linked to a &NAME &NAME ) 
^ * Detailed Textual Analysis 
^ * Which leads to : What are the advantages ? 
^ Or why should you consider ilexir instead of the competition ? 
^ ( Best of breed , emphasise University heritage , years of rigorous testing , proven . 
^ &NAME I ca n't tell if &NUM is good or exceptionally good . ) 
^ Best , 
^ &NAME . 
^ &NAME / &NAME &NAME , thanks for making the introduction . 
^ As promised , I 'm sending you a bit more draft text that addresses in less technical terms what we are about and what makes the technology unique . 
^ When finished this , will be part of the ilexir website . 
^ Comments very welcome . 
^ I 'm also including some urls pointing to the existing non-commercial licence and quick demo for researchers of the system . 
^ &NAME , if you think there is a potential connection / collaboration here , then please do get back to me best ,

^ &WEBSITE &NAME &NAME provides commercial licensing , support and consultancy for the robust accurate statistical parsing ( &NAME ) toolkit . 
^ The toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification , summarisation , mining and querying . 
^ It is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems , which go beyond pure term indexing or domain-specific entity extraction . 
^ The &NAME toolkit is a package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to , properties predicated of these relations , and relations which hold between them . 
^ For instance , the following text sentence-from the transcript of President &NAME 's speech at the &NAME Museum Center on 7th October , &NUM -- is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath : Members of the &NAME of both political parties , and members of &ORG &ORG , agree that &NAME &NAME is a threat to peace and must disarm . 
^ Entities : [ Member+s of the &NAME of both political parties ] [ Member+s ] [ the &NAME ] [ both political parties ] [ political parties ] [ parties ] [ &NAME &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ &ORG &ORG ] [ &ORG ] [ the &ORG ] [ the Council ] Relations : [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] The actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats ( href ) Term-based systems represent text documents as ' bags of words ' ( i.e. sets of characters between white spaces ) but will not directly recover the entities referred to in a document , such as ' &NAME &NAME ' , ' political parties ' , ' &ORG &ORG ' or ' members of &NAME of both political parties ' . 
^ Representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides a better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents , such as ' the &NAME &NAME Council ' or ' the &ORG ' , and thus also a better way of classifying , summarising or querying document content via salient entities . 
^ The &NAME system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in a domain-independent way into names ( subdivided into places , people , organisations ) , numbers ( including ranges , dates , etc ) , measure phrases ( ounce , year , etc ) , temporal expressions ( days , weeks , months ) , directions ( north , south , etc ) , and so forth . 
^ Relational representation of entities provides a natural and effective mechanism for cross-indexing alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations ( href ) . 
^ Extant systems for extracting entities from text , based on deterministic finite-state pattern matching , rely heavily on manually-supplied domain-specific lexical information from the outset . 
^ The relational information recovered by the &NAME system can be used to index ' who did what to whom ' and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across a document collection . 
^ A relational pattern like ' [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] agree [ ? ] ' ( ' What does the &NAME &NAME Council agree ? ' ) can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise , specific and small amounts of focussed information . 
^ This approach to information retrieval deals naturally with non-contiguous text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation ( [ the &ORG ] [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] ) as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems , such as negation ( [ the Council ] [ not agree ] [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] $ neq $ [ the Council ] agree [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] ) . 
^ The &NAME toolkit achieves about &NUM accuracy recovering entities and relations from arbitrary English texts , without making use of domain-specific lexical information . 
^ It has been used to date to analyse about &NUM million words of English . 
^ A recent paper from a refereed conference proceedings gives more details about each module of the toolkit and compares performance to related systems . 
^ &NAME and performance for specific applications can be considerably improved by semi-automatic customisation on domain and / or application specific text . 
^ The toolkit is fully compatible with existing &NAME standards for text &NAME up and can be used to leverage web sites which will conform with emerging standards for the semantic web ( &NAME / &NAME href ) . 
^ A non-exclusive commercial licence to use the &NAME toolkit , which includes &NUM hours support and consultancy to assist with customising and integrating the toolkit into the client 's application , costs $ pounds $ &NUM , &NUM . 
^ The toolkit is available free for non-commercial use including prototyping and proof-of-concept work in industry . 
^ Support for this and / or general consultancy on &NAME / IR applications and systems is available from &NAME Ltd at a rate of $ pounds $ &NUM / hour . 
^ The cofounders of &NAME are &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME . 
^ The &NAME toolkit is the product of collaborative research at the University of &NAME , &NAME Laboratory and University of &NAME , &ORG . 
^ &NAME &NAME has sole rights to commercial exploitation of the toolkit and works closely with these academic groups to continuously enhance and improve the performance of the toolkit .

^ For further information , please visit : &WEBSITE 
^ Dear &NAME 
^ Please find below this week 's issue of &NAME , written exclusively by &NAME Group Analysts . 
^ DISCOVERING A STRATEGY 
^ Discovery - whether of information by an individual , or of services by an organisation - is essential for the effective use of the &NAME . 
^ The Web is an increasingly tangled morass of data , the vast majority of which is not relevant to specific searches ; nevertheless , search engines are regularly deceived into delivering hits that will waste the time of any searcher . 
^ This is annoying for an end-user , but potentially very expensive for a business , which will lose productive employee time to sifting through search results . 
^ Ensuring the filtering of information in a dependable manner is therefore a real business opportunity at both the individual and corporate levels , and at present the dominant force in this space is &NAME . 
^ THE BIG &NAME &NAME has rapidly risen as a force to be reckoned with in the search field , due to the strength of its algorithms and rapid brand creation , but it is now also positioning itself as a potential rival to the established portal businesses , such as &NAME ! , &NAME , and &NAME 's &NAME &NAME . 
^ These sites have made considerable use of &NAME 's leading search technology , which is increasingly placing them in potentially awkward positions . 
^ On the &NUM hand , &NAME searches are regularly driving new visitors to their sites , and indeed &NAME ! 
^ has been utilising &NAME search technology since &NUM . 
^ On the other , &NAME is adding functionality and features , such as news and shopping capabilities , that undermine some of the core businesses involved in these sites , and its influence is constantly growing . 
^ As part of its response to this threat , &NAME ! 
^ has recently acquired &NAME , a search company based on technology that failed to compete with &NAME . 
^ No announcement has yet been made that &NAME will replace the use of &NAME at &NAME ! , but this is clearly only a matter of timing . 
^ On the face of things , this seems an uncertain strategy , as the &NAME search technology is perceived as being inferior to that of &NAME . 
^ However , &NAME ! 
^ has clearly recognised that in order to protect its long-term interests it must avoid any dependence on third-party search technology , particularly when this is provided by an increasingly competitive business . 
^ Much of the real value in the long-term discovery market will be in the fee-based provision of service-oriented searches in the Web services arena , which will attract corporate business . 
^ Emerging standards , including the Universal Discovery Description and &NAME ( &NAME ) , and the recently announced WS-Policy , will combine to simplify the process of providing and acquiring business services on-line . 
^ However , these initiatives will not initially serve the needs of many smaller companies , which will lack the developmental resources required to utilise them ; this leaves a vast discovery market that the leading brand portals will be able to enter as providers of service . 
^ &NAME GROUP OPINION:- The search industry has consolidated very rapidly in recent years , and &NAME is the clear winner at the individual user level . 
^ If the portals are to succeed in preventing their core businesses from being leeched away by the expansion of &NAME into new territories , they must begin to make more decisive moves to position themselves as credible service providers in the discovery space ; if this is to be done successfully , it will require investments in both technology and brand creation . 
^ The portals must position themselves as discovery service providers now , which will require investments in search technology such as that made by &NAME ! , or they may find that &NAME will dominate that market as well . 
^ MAKING DATA QUALITY COUNT 
^ It does n't matter how efficiently a company 's &NAME , or &NAME solutions are able to group and segment customers and their data to support the latest marketing campaign or promotional mail shot . 
^ If the source data itself is of a poor quality , then the information extracted may already have been compromised . 
^ When you also consider the high levels of project failure reported within customer facing IT sectors , it should be seen as a fundamental issue to ensure that data quality and accuracy is made a prime consideration . 
^ THE BIG &NAME Many enterprise level organisations keep commercial information about their customers , and the products and services that they provide across a number of data stores . 
^ Sometimes this may cause an inability to correctly identify customers , or alternatively to identify the same customers more than once . 
^ All of which can cause important customers to receive incorrectly addressed , duplicate , or inappropriate information . 
^ The results being , possible lost sales opportunities , money wasted on capturing and maintaining useless or duplicate records , and probably most importantly from a corporate perspective , presenting an image to the outside world of inefficiency . 
^ There are also other issues to be considered , perhaps fraud prevention may be an important area , especially to those delivering services in the financial sectors , or the prevention of money laundering could be a key issue . 
^ In each case the quality of the source data is important , and lack of data quality can lead to undesirable activities being hidden . 
^ Holding and maintaining records on a database , whether customer , product , or other record types has a measurable cost both in terms of storage , maintenance , and support activities . 
^ Therefore , the value that can be derived from deploying a good quality data cleansing tool can be measured in a number of ways including : reduced staff costs in the customer support and systems maintenance areas , reduced mailing costs by ensuring that offers made are correctly targeted and individual customer duplications are removed , and increased sales revenue through having the ability to accurately identify cross-selling and up-selling opportunities . 
^ &NAME GROUP &NAME Very few vendors working in the mainstream &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME arenas would argue against the fact that data quality , or lack thereof , is one of the main issues when attempting to deliver effective business solutions . 
^ Our view would be that there are at least &NUM major areas of concern to be considered when looking at improving data quality within an organisation . 
^ Firstly , there is the initial issue of data cleansing , which often in the past has focused on one-shot attempts to clean up customer and associated data with a specific goal in mind . 
^ Secondly , and an issue for any organisation that is serious about the quality of data that it continues to maintain , there is the question of how to permanently maintain data integrity once the initial cleansing exercise has been completed . 
^ When selecting a solution to imbed or run alongside mainstream infrastructure systems we would recommend that the selected system should be capable of providing both batch and real-time cleansing facilities especially in environments where data change is dynamic , and especially where customer contact is made on the basis of the organisations in depth knowledge of the customer . 
^ SPENDING BEFORE INFORMATION 
^ Despite figures that show that only &NUM in &NUM members of the public are accessing Government Web sites , e-tail Web sites would appear to be faring rather better . 
^ As is usually the case , the trend has been set in the US with customer sales reaching just under US $ &NUM billion in &NUM , but it appears that the &NAME is now following &NAME , and is in serious catch up mode with on-line shopping growing &NUM times faster in the &NAME than in the US at present . 
^ Although consumers still have concerns over the security of e-tail sites , there are advantages to shopping on-line and it would appear that these advantages are at last making a breakthrough . 
^ THE BIG &NAME The Government has recently vowed to dedicate more funds to increasing the number of people who access its services on-line . 
^ However , it appears that e-tailers hardly have to try . 
^ The interactive &ORG ( &NAME ) has found that &NUM million &NAME shoppers bought on-line in November &NUM , spending &NUM billion pounds . 
^ This figure is expected to rise to more than &NUM in the next few months according to a &NAME poll carried out on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry ( &NAME ) . 
^ The &NUM billion pound figure for November is the biggest ever amount spent on-line in the &NAME , and represents a &NUM rise on October 2002's figures and a spectacular &NUM rise on the same period for the previous year . 
^ The benefits of buying on-line include time and monetary savings , home delivery of goods , and better consumer rights . 
^ These benefits have , however , always been available and do not explain the huge rise in e-tail sales . 
^ &NAME has been improved , which may have helped to allay some people 's concerns , although a survey carried out by &NAME &NAME found that around &NUM of its respondents still felt ' uncomfortable ' giving out their credit card information on-line , and similar percentages were worried about the security of on-line financial transactions , and on-line privacy in general . 
^ The rise in broadband take-up is also thought to be partly responsible for the rise in e-tail sales , with its ability to make browsing and accessing e-tail sites even faster . 
^ e-tailers in the &NAME have been found to be better at converting browsers into customers . 
^ Nielsen//Net Ratings found that of the &NUM large developed economies they surveyed , the &NAME converted the most browsers into paying customers . 
^ Other research by &NAME also revealed that more people would be prepared to shop on-line if there were better guarantees about issues such as security and the quality of merchandise . 
^ The &NAME Government is helping to promote on-line buying by , for example , publishing examples of people who have benefited by making purchases on-line and generally promoting the on-line message . 
^ &NAME GROUP &NAME Ease of use issues are important where both Government and e-tail Web sites are concerned , but at the end of the day shopping i.e. spending money on things you want or need , especially from the comfort of your own home , is far more attractive than finding out information mostly concerning the payment of bills , or mundane issues such as rubbish collection . 
^ It may also be a case of preference and tradition . 
^ People often wish to hear a real person tell them local government type information or to deal with a complaint , but are quite happy to shop alone . 
^ &NAME e-tail sites are adept at attracting browsers and enticing them to part with their cash and can be secure in the knowledge that improvements to security will result in increased numbers of on-line consumers . 
^ OUTLOOK WINTRY ( FOR &NAME 'S IT STAFF ) 
^ &NUM saw IT jobs continuing to be axed by employers in the &NAME . 
^ Reductions in end-users ' IT spending reined in the requirement for development and integration expertise from consultancies , as well as causing the loss of jobs amongst in-house IT staff . 
^ IT budgets are likely to be severely limited in &NUM , with forecast growth as low as &NUM . 
^ THE BIG &NAME Looking back only a few years , many factors combined to produce a boom in &NAME IT employment that will almost certainly never be repeated . 
^ The recession of the early 1990's left businesses and the public sector with a backlog of change requirements , and facing a looming deadline to do something to address the &NAME issue . 
^ These circumstances saw many embark on the wholesale replacement of enterprise systems , by customised redevelopment or more commonly by the procurement of package solutions , both of which were readily supplied by a hungry and helpful IT industry . 
^ &NAME of utilities , and the rapid growth of the mobile telecommunications industry were also significant drivers of IT spending . 
^ After the millennium , and the loss of confidence in dot-anything there has seemed an uncertainty about how to deploy IT budget to best advantage . 
^ The Government 's determined spending is a sole exception , perhaps unfettered by such considerations . 
^ Organisations ' current IT spending plans reveal the priorities for the near future to be asset protection and consolidation . 
^ Such investment as there is will be aimed towards security , &NAME ( to derive value from existing data ) , content management ( with the same objective ) , or application integration ( to enhance value from legacy systems and other existing software ) . 
^ Like an increasing proportion of business requirements , these will be addressed with maximum use of packaged solutions in order to hasten implementation and Return On &NAME ( &NAME ) . 
^ &NAME has proved attractive to many companies , enabling them to reduce staff numbers and stabilise or reduce spending on IT . 
^ The service provider to whom in-house IT staff have been transferred use the human resources flexibly , according to which of its customers need bodies from the pool of expertise , achieving more efficient and dynamic deployment of staff . 
^ Overall , the number of IT resources required is reduced . 
^ Indeed , the outsourcing providers themselves increasingly consolidate and merge , gaining further efficiency via reduction in numbers of consultants . 
^ &NAME GROUP &NAME Advice for those hoping to thrive or perhaps even survive at a time of so much aggregation must be to work with a significant market player . 
^ Skills in greatest demand change constantly , but nevertheless must be kept up to date - understanding what is shaping the employment market place is the best guide to what skills will be needed ( &NAME Group 's analysis is an invaluable aid ) . 
^ Ominously for some , offshore service providers have already provided cost-efficient expert resource , and are likely to build on their success by competing more directly in the &NAME market . 
^ &NAME Group has built a considerable reputation , not only for the quality of its technical research , but also for the ability to relate complex technical issues to the needs of business .

^ Hi &NAME ! 
^ Your email would be very gratefully received . 
^ I 'm more concerned with genuine email , as I already have a LARGE amount of junk , extracted from an online archive . 
^ The easiest way to donate email is to simply send the back-end ' message folder ' files , which include all of the header info . 
^ For example , if you have a folder entitled ' msgs ' then it will appear as the file ' msgs ' in the ' ~/mail / ' folder wherever your email is stored ( i.e. in your hermes filespace ) , which can be accessed via ftp or similar . 
^ These files can be fed directly into the anonymiser . 
^ Thanks very much for your help &NAME ,

^ Re : E-mail &NAME &NAME 
^ I get a fair bit of mail , junk and otherwise which I 'd be happy to donate , if anonymised . 
^ I currently use &NAME which , since tweaked , seems to do a fairly good job of filtering my mail , but I can always filter it out to you rather than marking it as &NAME and putting it in the trash . 
^ Let me know how you want the mail , whether you want mail forwarded , copied in its raw state ( including all headers ) or whatever . 
^ I do n't know whether you just want my &NAME account ( which is mainly &NAME stuff + &NAME ) or my general account e-mail too ( which includes stuff from outside uni , various ( high-traffic ) mailing lists , occassional random e-mail from someone who used my software which I wrote before coming to uni ( or a complaint from someone who 's been infected by a virus and thinks I gave it to them ) etc. I rarely get any viruses , since &NAME seems to stop prolific viruses in &NAME and my external account is scanned in &NAME , although I do get the empty messages without the worms ( hey , my &NAME folder is full of e-mails from &EMAIL at the moment ! ) . 
^ Let me know if & how I can assist anyway

^ UNIVERSITY OF SUSSEX 
^ DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATICS 
^ &NAME &NAME Available 
^ &NUM 3-year PhD studentship are available starting on or around &NUM October &NUM associated with the following &NUM &NAME EPSRC-funded projects . 
^ COGENT : Controlled Generation of &NAME ' , 
^ Natural Language Generation ( &NAME ) technology has reached a level of maturity where applied systems exist in a range of specialised real-world domains ( such as weather bulletins , software documentation , health and legal advice and stock market movements ) . 
^ However , developing such systems currently involves hand-crafting and special-purpose tuning by &NAME experts which is non-portable , non-scaleable , time-consuming and expensive . 
^ Wider deployment of language generation requires more generally applicable and reusable &NAME components based on wide-coverage grammars ; however , at present effective techniques for such wide-coverage generation are not well understood . 
^ The COGENT project will investigate systematically the characteristics of wide-coverage generation and to develop techniques for controlling it effectively . 
^ As well as furthering our understanding of wide-coverage generation , the project aims to deliver a substantial and novel resource to support future research in this area , and practical implementations of wide-coverage controllable generators . 
^ The project is in collaboration with &NAME , University of &NAME . 
^ Natural Language Service Composition 
^ The pervasive computing environment of the future will provide a wide variety of services within the network . 
^ The value of such services will be greatly enhanced if we are able to tailor our computing environment by composing services . 
^ For example you might want to arrange for your heating to be turned off when your calendar indicates that you will be out of your house for more than a day . 
^ This project investigates how &NAME techniques can help make service composition a possibility for non-technical users . 
^ Services , such as heating systems and personal calendars , advertise themselves to a service directory that will develop an ontology of services . 
^ This can be exploited to constrain the discourse domain in which users describe new features . 
^ The interface will guide the user to an unambiguous expression of the new feature that can be mapped onto a standard component architecture of services . 
^ These studentships would be suitable for people interested in carrying out research into areas such as 
^ * statistical &NAME 
^ * applied natural language semantics , 
^ * lexical acquisition for practical language processing systems or 
^ * the association of linguistic knowledge with ontologies 
^ Applicants for these studentships should have a good first degree and / or postgraduate qualification in computer science , computer processing of language , or similar . 
^ The studentships covers tuition fees for &NAME nationals ; the projects also pay a ( tax-free ) stipend starting at &NAME &NUM a year . 
^ The grants include funds for attendance at relevant workshops and conferences . 
^ See ( &WEBSITE language processing work at the University of &NAME . 
^ Interested candidates should email their &NAME ( as plain text , postscript , or pdf ) as soon as possible to : Dr &NAME &NAME , e-mail : &EMAIL .

^ At the moment I am taking non-spam emails on a personal-use only basis . 
^ If I get to the point where distributing the corpus for wider use is a viable option I will need to go back to the people I got the emails from and get specific permission . 
^ My current ( quite underdeveloped ) thoughts on anonymising are as follows : 
^ - replace person names in body text and subject field with some form of ' Proper Name ' tag 
^ - remove email addresses from body text and subject field ( perhaps replaced with an ' Email Add ' tag containing the domain , if non-sensitive ) 
^ - remove postal addresses from body text ( and subject field ) ( again , may be replaced with a ' Postal Address ' tag ) 
^ - probably ignore From and To field information ( although could retain non-sensitive domain data ) 
^ It is likely that any classification-based spam filter would be used in conjunction with a black / white list technique , so From and To information would be incorporated into that rather than the text classification side .

<CONTENT-TYPE> text/plain; charset="us-ascii" </CONTENT-TYPE>
<MESSAGE_BODY>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ There are &NUM verbs in &NAME , so it wld be interesting to know how well these map to the frequency ranking from &NAME -- maybe we shld use Comlex as our list of verbs to build entries for ? 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Yes , that would also enable me to use consistent method for lexicon building / filtering . 
^ We may want to omit some of the low frequency Comlex verbs , though ... I made some calculations . 
^ There 're now &NUM new files in /usr / groups / dict / subcat / rasp_lexicon 
^ &NUM ) in-comlex 
^ which contains &NAME frequencies for the &NUM Comlex verbs : &NUM verbs occur more than &NUM times &NUM verbs occur less than &NUM times 
^ &NUM ) not-comlex 
^ which contains frequencies for the &NUM , &NUM non-Comlex verbs in &NAME : &NUM verbs occur more than &NUM times ( most are &NAME spellings or noise from the tagger / parser ) &NUM , &NUM verbs occur less than &NUM times 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ There are another &NUM which occur btwn &NUM times and &NUM which occur &NUM times -- how do we know that &NUM is the correct cut-off ? 
^ Maybe we shld be thinking more in terms of &NUM egs / verb so that we can allow for parse failures etc ? 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Yes , I meant &NUM occurrences after parsing ( i.e. after failures ) . 
^ The above freqs were calculated from parsed data . 
^ To end up with &NUM , we 'd need some &NUM egs / verb as input to parsing . 
^ That 's really the minimum . 
^ The accuracy of both subcat acquisition and clustering drops sharply if we use less than &NUM parsed sentences ( not sure about wsd / sel . 
^ prefs , but I 'd imagine it 's the same ) . 
^ Generally , of course , the more data the better . 
^ In my recent experiments , I got best subcat and clustering results with my biggest dataset -- &NUM egs per verb . 
^ For the * really * frequent verbs , should we use all the data we have in &NAME , or do we set some upper bound ? 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Perhaps this would be a sensible way to proceed : 
^ Use some correlation of the &NAME ranking and comlex to choose 5-6k verbs that we shld do ( i.e. add non-comlex verbs that occur more than &NUM times in &NAME 
^ Get all the relevant sentences from the &NAME and ( re ) parse them and extract patternsets 
^ Get more sentences for those verbs underrepresented in &NAME ( ( &NUM egs ? ) by creating queries to &NAME designed to find pdf / ps documents containing them , feed these sentences through pdftotext / pstoascii some special preprocessing , and then rasp 
^ I think I can set up the pipeline to parse and extract patternsets ) , but it wld be good to check manually with &NAME that we 'll find enough relevant sentences this way for a small sample of underrepresented candidates ... 
^ Proceed as before 
^ Any thoughts ? 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ This sounds good . 
^ I can do the manual checking for &NUM frequency ranges of ( samples of ) underrepresented verbs e.g. by next week .

<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ Here enclosed the mail we sent to &NAME &NAME , editor of the volume of papers arising from the recent &NAME Conference &NUM , to protest against an incorrect editorial choice since she chose as a reviewer the very proponent of the theory we critically examined in our submitted contribution . 
^ Our intention is to let the community know this dysfunctioning since it will become impossible to establish a debate if the criticized theorist can stop it as reviewer . 
^ Sincerely yours &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NAME , Christian &NAME 
^ &NAME , As you know , the article that we have submitted for the Language Evolution volume belongs to a set of articles that refute point by point &NAME &NAME 's theory [ that ' Neanderthal man did not have the anatomical prerequisites for producing the full range of human speech ' ] . 
^ We received the &NUM reviews of our paper , and we told you that we felt it absolutely shocking that &NUM of them had been done by Ph.D 's . 
^ We proposed in consequence that at least a third reviewer should be solicited . 
^ Your answer was negative , indicating ' I know from personal experience that one can often feel extremely angry when receiving rather negative reports . ' Of course , we are perfectly aware that it is not pleasant to have a submitted paper discarded but that is not the question ( each of us has already published a large number of papers in his life , and knows what a review process is ) . 
^ In your answer you add : ' &NAME , I submitted a paper to Lingua which argued against the work on language evolution by XXX . 
^ When the reports arrived , it was clear that he was &NUM of the referees ( ... ) This is by no means an isolated experience for me : in my experience both with the &NAME &NAME ( of which I am an editor ) and in my own research , it is 
^ * normal * for &NUM of the reviewers to be the person whose work is called into question ' . 
^ We do not think that this procedure is * normal * , particularly if there are only &NUM reviewers , and there is a serious problem with the present review process . 
^ Indeed , the main opponent has been chosen as reviewer , which is definitely not correct , the more so since he used a number of arguments that clearly escape the scientific debate ( e.g. fraud accusation which is absolutely unacceptable , and that we will certainly not accept and let propagate as such ; and a curious citation about &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , which has obviously nothing to do in a review process ) . 
^ Hence we are in a situation in which since the beginning , it is obvious that &NUM reviewer over &NUM will fight against this paper by any means ( even arguable &NUM ) and certainly refuse it . 
^ This is definitely unacceptable . 
^ We feel that you and Ph. &NAME are unable to take the measure of a controversy which is fair and needs to be editorially processed with a debate . 
^ We will let the community ( and first the Programme Committee of &NAME &NUM and the editors of Journals in the field of Phonetics and &NAME &NAME ) know about this review process , and make their own judgment . 
^ We hope that it will help improve further debates happen in a sounder way in the future . 
^ Sincerely yours &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME &NAME , Christian &NAME 
^ &NAME - Surprisingly , the &NUM reviewers of our abstract to the &NAME conference , were quite positive about our work , as you can see . 
^ FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on the EVOLUTION of LANGUAGE &NAME , March &NUM , &NUM 
^ Dear Colleague , 
^ Thank you for submitting an abstract to this conference . 
^ I am pleased to tell you that the abstract submitted under the first-author name below has been accepted as the basis for a talk for the conference . 
^ boe 
^ Meanwhile , I include , beneath the dashed line , our referees ' comments on your abstract . 
^ Best wishes , &NAME &NAME 
^ Title of Paper : The size of the pharynx : An irrelevant parameter for speech emergence and acquisition 
^ Since &NAME & &NAME postulated in &NUM the theory that &NAME were a speechless species , the potential speech capability of &NAME has been a debated question . 
^ These authors claimed that the development of a low laryngeal position was a necessary condition for the realization of a sufficient number of vocalic contrasts , since the potential vowel space was enlarged due to an enlarged pharyngeal cavity . 
^ Like newborn infants , &NAME did not possess this ' anatomical basis of speech ' , and therefore could not speak . 
^ In this study , we refute the &NAME arguments developed by &NAME & &NAME . 
^ We quantify the vocal tract geometry by a &NAME &NAME Index corresponding to the length ratio of the pharyngeal cavity to the oral cavity . 
^ Using a new anthropomorphic articulatory model controlled by lips , jaw and tongue parameters , we introduce variations of the &NAME to approximate a vocal tract of a newborn infant , a child , a female adult and a male adult . 
^ We generate the potential maximum acoustic vowel space ( with &NUM , &NUM vowel items ) corresponding to these &NAME &NAME Index variations and we compare the results in the acoustic spaces of the first &NUM formants with well known data of phonemes of the world 's languages . 
^ Our simulations show that the Maximal Vowel Space of a given vocal tract does not depend on the &NAME &NAME Index : gestures of the tongue body , lips and jaw allow compensation for differences in the ratio between the dimensions of the oral cavity and pharynx . 
^ We infer that the vowel space of &NAME ( with high or low larynx ) was no smaller than that of a modern human and that they could produce all the vowels of the world 's languages . 
^ Our study is strictly limited to the morphological and acoustic aspects of the vocal tract , and we cannot therefore offer any definitive answer to the question of whether &NAME spoke or not . 
^ However , we do feel safe in claiming that &NAME were not morphologically handicapped for speech . 
^ A low larynx ( and large pharynx ) cannot be considered to be the ' anatomical prerequisites for producing the full range of human speech ' . 
^ If &NAME could not talk , it is unlikely to have been for the articulatory acoustic reasons advocated by &NAME & &NAME . 
^ &NAME were no more vocally handicapped than children at birth are . 
^ The brain is entirely capable of controlling a vocal instrument with a somewhat longer or shorter pharynx : these differences do not actually change the capacity for maximally contrasting vowels . 
^ There is therefore no reason to believe that the lowering of the larynx and a concomitant increase in pharynx size are necessary evolutionary pre-adaptations for speech . 
^ Referee &NUM 
^ Definitely accept . 
^ Convincing attempt to deal with a previously proposed aspect of the theory of speech evolution by deducing corollaries from emprical &NAME analysis . 
^ Referee &NUM 
^ Definitely accept . 
^ This paper is among the first to challenge the well known hypothesis of &NAME and his colleagues concerning the role of the lowered larynx in expanding the potential vowel space of &NAME sapiens , a hypothesis that has largely gone unchallenged ( despite sceptical murmurs from the wings ) for nearly &NUM years . 
^ The argument of the paper may not be without its difficulties , in so far as it rests on a model of vowel production by a modern vocal tract . 
^ Moreover , if &NAME 's hypothesis is indeed false , we are left without a plausible account of why the larynx lowered and , as &NAME observed , increased the probability of death by choking . 
^ Nonetheless , the author 's thesis is clearly argued and will doubtless stimulate much valuable discussion at the conference .

^ Executive Summary : &NAME access to nearly all &NAME machines in the Lab will soon cease to permit ' ssh &NAME ' and ' password based ' . 
^ This only effects people logging into &NAME Lab machines from outside the Lab . 
^ If you cannot connect , please try connecting to &WEBSITE , and seek help from &EMAIL 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ Currently most machines in the Lab allow access using ssh protocols &NAME and &NAME , using password or publickey based authentication . 
^ V1 and password access are security concerns ( protocol problems and keyboard sniffers respectively ) , so &WEBSITE and &WEBSITE already has the restrictions ) . 
^ ssh-relay2 will not allow ssh &NAME connections , but will allow password based authentication . 
^ As such , if you try to login and there is a problem , try ssh-relay [ &NUM ] to check whether it is related to the changes . 
^ You should be able to use the ssh or slogin command to connect from the relay machines to your desired machine . 
^ Feel free to use the relay machines as a transition aid , but note that they will not allow such access indefinitely , so ensure that your ssh client can use publickey based &NAME access . 
^ If your remote ssh client had been using ssh &NAME to connect to Lab machines in the past , the machine may only have the ssh &NAME public key of the Lab machine , so when using ssh V2 it may complain that the key is unknown . 
^ If so , look for the host 's fingerprint on the web page &WEBSITE ssh-relay3 is &NUM &NUM : &NAME : ad : &NAME : &NUM : &NAME : c7 : &NAME : df : fd : &NUM : &NAME : &NAME : &NUM : &NUM : a2 . 
^ Better still would be to jot down the fingerprint in advance . 
^ With the fingerprint , try connecting to the host again directly , and when asked whether to continue , check the fingerprint , and continue if it is correct . 
^ Otherwise , contact sys-admin . 
^ If your client does n't support ssh &NAME or publickey , try upgrading to a later version . 
^ &NAME users can use &NAME , and &NAME users can use PuTTY . 
^ Other packages which are layered on ssh ( scp , cvs , rsync , pscp , &NAME , etc ) will be similarly effected . 
^ If you do n't have a public key , you will need to generate &NUM and arrange that the private part is available on the client ( outside the Lab ) machine , and that the public part is registered in ~ /.ssh / authorized_keys in your Lab filespace . 
^ See &WEBSITE key , register it for incoming calls , and converting it to a suitable form for the Windows ssh agent pageant ' . 
^ Use a good pass phrase to encrypt the key , and do * NOT * use any existing password . 
^ Anyone setting things up in advance can test that things are working by &WEBSITE which already has the restrictions in force .

^ Other money constructions do show up with the &NAME tag in &NAME , usually when it includes a &NAME like million , etc.

^ Dear &NAME , Many of you may by now have heard the shocking news that the University of &NAME is intending to close its Linguistics Department . 
^ &NAME &NAME has written to ask whether colleagues might feel able to write to the &NAME &NAME in protest . 
^ My own feeling is that it would be right to do so , but I would not wish to speak for the Association without asking members for your views . 
^ If the general feeling is that the Committee should not write on behalf of the &NAME , I will be writing in any case , in my own capacity as a Professor of Linguistics at another &NAME University . 
^ However , my feeling is that a letter from one of the main learned societies in the academic discipline involved might be helpful to the case . 
^ Views , please ? 
^ I will be away from &NAME from lunchtime on Sunday until Thursday morning , and not accessing e-mail , but on my return I will post a summary if colleagues have contacted me off- list . 
^ Best wishes , April Professor April &NAME Head of Department Department of English Language and &NAME University of &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME 
^ President of the Linguistics Society of &NAME &NAME For more information on the &NAME , including details of how to join , see &WEBSITE

^ &NAME , 
^ As far as can remember , ' dereferencing ' is the linguistic term for linking pronouns ( &CHAR , YOU ) and other references ( &NAME , THAT ) to persons and objects ( and subsequently loaned by IT for variables ) Implicit vs. explicit then seems a natural way to make the distinction you 're after . 
^ Quite a mouthful , though &SMILEY 
^ &NAME : The border between the &NUM depends on the &NAME &NAME : at the low end only equation type dereferencing ( &NAME &NAME lives in &NAME &NAME ) , at the high end also sophisticated dereferencing of pronouns over sentence boundaries . 
^ Even simple cases can throw you : People having more than &NUM residence ( like president &NAME ) , refugees who are often indicated by their country of origin even when actually living in the &NAME ( &NAME &NAME from &NAME )

^ Whilst trying to observe and not react for a while so as to cut my email writing time , &NUM cannot but reply to this string with an unequivocal , no , &NAME is definitely not a waste of time , but a cornerstone of corpus linguistics . 
^ It is obvious that for the small corpus designer , &NUM million or less tokens , markup is a considerable investment in time . 
^ However , if one holds , as I do , that a corpus is not a simple mass of data , but a carefully compiled selection of texts , then we need a means to treat them as texts , to store both their general features and their particularities . 
^ This the &NAME does . 
^ In my own work in the field of English for Academic Purposes , I tend not to use the corpus header but a standard individual header so as to stock all the bibliographic information and socilinguistic parameters associated with the text . 
^ The depth of markup depends on my needs , and time , for an individual text . 
^ In this way I can move with ease from a fully annotated single text to a more lightly marked up corpus . 
^ This is possible because of the encoding possibilities of the &NAME . 
^ Education is very much part of the answer . 
^ Easy access to vast amounts of downloadable data has meant that a number of ' corpus &NAME ' neither know nor care about the niceties of corpus creation , and the whys and wherefores of selecting and marking up data . 
^ Ease of access has become the main criterion , potentially to the detriment of the discipline itself . 
^ Easy solutions do not necessarily answer the most pertinent questions . 
^ It is true that all this takes time , but if we throw out all that is time-consuming drudgery from corpus linguistics , we may find that we have thrown out our text baby with the corpus bathwater and are only left with ready-made corpora for ready-made answers . 
^ Back to some time consuming markup .

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ Yes , I have some sympathy with the point you make . 
^ The thing that has attracted me to the &NAME in the past , though , is once the effort is made to get to grips with it ( and it is daunting ) there is usually a well thought through solution contained in it for almost any problem situation you come across in encoding a corpus ! 
^ With that said , it is a clear theme of the posts so far that there is , at the very least , an advocacy issue related to the &NAME in corpus linguistics , which is interesting . 
^ Best , 
^ &CHAR 
^ Interesting question ... 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ There are &NUM issues here : 
^ &NUM Ignorance and confusion . 
^ Most people have only a vague idea what &NAME is or does or what it is good for . 
^ There would need to be a effort to ( re- ) educate the potential users of &NAME . 
^ Does &NAME do something different from &NAME ? 
^ Absurd question I know but that is the kind of confusion which I suspect exists . 
^ &NUM Complexity . 
^ When it was introduced many people reacted against it as too complex . 
^ Now they have all adopted xml , rdf etc. which are much more complicated to use . 
^ So potential users ' perception would now be ripe for a re-presentation of &NAME . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Related to both of these issues is that of the documentation available to educate people & help potential users understand what &NAME is , does , & is good for . 
^ A research assistant & I have recently been poring over a 
^ couple chapters of the &NAME guidelines , looking for guidelines & relevant examples to add some markup to our already ( mostly ) TEI-conformant corpus markup scheme . 
^ Although the documentation is extensive , it is inadequate 
^ in many ways , missing examples , not very good at giving a larger picture to people who are n't sure if they need / want the &NAME at all or who just need some pointers to a few relevant sections . 
^ If the only people who can read the documentation and make use of it are information / library science people who are specifically trained in that area , then it 's no wonder &NAME & others who are in the business of building corpora are not using it or promoting it .

^ Greetings ! 
^ We 've certainly lost touch , have n't we ? 
^ I saw your new book advertised in a &NAME brochure ( congratulations ) . 
^ It was quite strange , really : when I saw the &NAME return address on the envelope and started to open it , I actually thought of you before I 'd even seen the brochure . 
^ So I figured I was meant to email . 
^ Your career seems to be thriving , so I hope that means you are , too . 
^ And my &NAME , you 're now over &NUM ! ! ! 
^ I turn &NUM tomorrow , so no sympathy from me for a youth such as you . 
^ I hope all is going well ( seems like it ) , and that you 're still biking , fencing , and whatnot . 
^ Do you even get over here to the land of ice and snow , or are you pretty much Euro-focused these days ? ? ? 
^ Take care , and all the best , &NAME

^ This all looks excellent . 
^ Thanks for getting the ball rolling . 
^ Getting &NAME and &NAME to do one on &NAME 's would be especially good since ( &CHAR ) its a hot topic in both speech and language , and ( &CHAR ) getting their names on the journal as guest editors would add further credibility to &NAME as a journal that &NAME folks should read .

^ &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME have agreed to do one on &NAME . 
^ There is a Senseval competition next summer they are both helping to organise next summer , so the plan is to draw many papers from participants but leave it open to others . 
^ They are preparing a call for us to vet and pass on to &NAME 
^ &NAME &NAME ( and possibly &NAME &NAME ) want to do one on structured language models for &NAME , &NAME etc -- &NAME suggested this as he was worried that not enough good material would be forthcoming for one on unsupervised grammar induction . 
^ Further down the road , there is the possibility of one on stochastic &NAME , based on a workshop / conference due to happen next spring I think , but the organisers are still thinking about it . 
^ With luck the &NAME &NUM wld be ready for 2nd quarter &NUM

^ Hi &NAME ,

^ &NAME . 
^ Section &NUM : no full stop at end of sent with footnote &NUM 
^ &NAME output is not consistent : Figure &NUM does n't include positions whereas in section &NUM we have position numbers . 
^ Section &NUM : ( arg - &CHAR &CHAR - ) ( arg - &CHAR &CHAR - ) 
^ do you really mean for one of the args to have an extra space ? 
^ If they represent the same relations , they should look identical . 
^ When talkiing about table &NUM , you should say that mu represents the mean . 
^ Section &NUM : footnote &NUM should come after the full stop . 
^ Table &NUM : antecendent - ) antecedent 
^ Table &NUM reference in text +anaphora - ) +antecedent

^ Workshop themes 
^ The workshop is intended to address what we view as &NUM central issues for the development of computational models of human language processing . 
^ We feel these issues represent the current stumbling blocks to constructing the next generation of models , and our aim is to hear concrete views on how to tackle these problems now and where research efforts should be directed in the medium term . 
^ &NUM Models of working memory in language processing : to what extent does human working memory influence language processing behaviour , are the mechanisms for language processing adapted to take memory constraints into account ? 
^ More generally , how should theories of sentence processing be situated within , and reconciled with , more general accounts of cognitive processing and cognitive limitations ? 
^ &NUM . 
^ Broad coverage : how can we develop psycholinguistic models that scale up in such a way that explains both high performance in general as well as the more pathological behaviours focused upon in psycholinguistic research ? 
^ What kinds of mechanisms ( statistical , constraint-based , ... ) and linguistic theories ( dependency , generative , incremental ) seem most promising for developing broad coverage models ? 
^ &NUM . 
^ Semantics in performance : how can we extend current syntactically-based accounts with implementable approximations of human semantic knowledge ( lexical , sentential , as well as plausibility ) ?

^ Dear All , 
^ &NAME &NAME from the &NAME will present a seminar to the &NAME group entitled : 
^ ' Solubility and protein-solvent interfaces of monomeric proteins ' 
^ DATE : 23rd April ( Wednesday ) 
^ TIME : 11.30am-12.30pm 
^ TRANSPORT : 
^ &NUM &NUM a.m. Tennis &NAME Road , in front of the new &NAME department 
^ &NUM &NUM a.m. &NAME ( roundabout ) 
^ and back after the talk . 
^ Can people who are planning on using the bus please email back to me , so that we have some idea of the numbers on the bus 
^ Also , as you know there is a &NAME talk at the &NAME on the 22nd April . 
^ There will also be a bus running to this talk , leaving &NAME / &NAME at 
^ &NUM 40am . 
^ ABSTRACT : &NAME is understood in the relationship between the sequence , structure and solubility of a protein . 
^ However , it is clear that the function of a protein is intimately related to its solubility , namely that structural proteins are insoluble while enzymes must have a very high solubility . 
^ Our inability to predict solubility presents practical difficulties , especially for &NAME &NAME Initiatives as up to &NUM of non-membrane proteins cannot be crystallised due to insolubility of the sample . 
^ Furthermore , it seems plausible that the mechanisms responsible for the formation of insoluble amyloid fibrils are similar to those at play in the formation of the random insoluble aggregates that form in inclusion bodies . 
^ It is clear that the hydrophobic ( or polar ) content of the surface of a protein plays a key role in its solubility . 
^ Given the collective behaviour of water , we hypothesise , that individual surface residues may not necessarily play a decisive role in dictating its solubility but that patches of residues may well do so . 
^ To examine this , we construct a score based on the average hydrophobic / polar content of surface patches of atoms ( or residues ) over a set of &NUM monomeric proteins . 
^ To see if the resulting distribution of scores is unusal we compare the distribution of scores for each protein with the scores from an equivalent randomised surface . 
^ We can also examine the variation of the score for each patch over homologous proteins . 
^ Here too we can compare the distribution of scores with scores generated from randomised sequences . 
^ In the first case , we find that the atomic patch score , have distributions with shorter tails than those generated from the randomised surfaces indicating that the surface atoms are arranging themselves so as to avoid extrema of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity . 
^ Perhaps more interestingly , in the case of examining the hydrophobic patch score as it varys over sequences , we find that hydrophobic patches tend to be supressed , suggesting that surface residues can evolve in a collective fashion . 
^ We argue that this confirms our initial hypothesis , what its consequences are and some future research we can carry out . 
^ I hope to see many of you at the talk , 
^ Regards ,

^ &NAME , 
^ I am looking for a large hierarchical corpus of text documents , for a research in the field of hierarchical classification .

^ Dear All , 
^ This information has been sent to us by the University Computing Service . 
^ Introduction of spam scanning 
^ On Thursday morning ( &NUM ) we will be installing the first stage of the email scanning system on ppsw ( the central email relay ) . 
^ This will scan messages for spam-like features , and score them accordingly , to make it easier for users to filter their email . 
^ An easy to use interface that will allow users to control the level of spam that arrives in their &NAME inbox will be introduced on &NAME next week . 
^ Note that we are not changing the central filtering rules at this stage , only adding an &NAME to messages coming into the University that will allow users to filter their own mail so that spam is delivered into a separate mailbox that may be examined at &NAME . 
^ More information , including details of how to filter your messages to remove spam from your inbox on systems other than &NAME , can be found in recent editions of the &NAME Service Newsletter : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ As a result of this work there may be some interruptions to the flow of email during installation and final testing , but this should only result in messages being delayed , not lost or rejected . 
^ Email will not be unduly delayed when the system is in normal operation . 
^ &WEBSITE &NAME Leader , &NAME Officer Computer Office , &NAME College University of &NAME &NAME Road , &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM &NUM &WEBSITE Today 's the day I do nothing .

^ &NAME &NAME , 
^ If you do n't mind I have a few questions in regards to starting my &NAME project . 
^ Firstly I have assumed as I have n't heard any differently that I am being permitted to continue with the course even though my overall grade was C+ ( although will have to raise this to a B- to pass the course ) . 
^ Am I able to start my project before the start of the second year ? 
^ I know that I would like to do a project in a speech rather than a language area ( as this relates to my current job ) . 
^ My employers have some ideas on the kind of areas they would like me to work on but I am not sure what the process is of making this official or finding someone to supervise me . 
^ Should I submit a proposal to you and then a supervisor would be assigned or should I go through another route ? 
^ The preliminary discussions I have had about my project with my employers all relate to areas that would have a direct commercial use i.e using existing recognisers ( in our case it would most likely be Nuance&SMILEY and working on how to optimise their use in various situations . 
^ Is a project along these lines acceptable ? 
^ Thank you for your time , &NAME

<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ The thing I showed you the other day was for the tagger , NOT the tokeniser . 
^ The syntax is : &CHAR fn where fn the file containing the exclusions 
^ The tokeniser is a standard flex ( bog-standard &CHAR lexical analyser-generator ) program , and as such would probably need to have the exclusions written into the .lex file containing the lexical rules . 
^ It is n't difficult to modify the lexer ( I 've made quite a few modifications for my dodgy email data ) , and the whole thing compiles into a &CHAR program , so you could modify it to take a list of exclusions ; however I do n't think flex automatically generates an exclusion list feature ( although I could be wrong - have a look at the online documentation ) . 
^ I guess that 's not great news , but I hope you can do something with it .

^ We are pleased to announce the &NAME release of the WordNet : : Similarity package . 
^ This is a significant upgrade to our previous Distance packages . 
^ You can find &NAME : : &NAME ( including &NAME ) at : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ This package consists of &NAME modules along with supporting &NAME programs that implement the semantic similarity measures of &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME &NAME ( &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) . 
^ The package contains &NAME modules designed as object classes with methods that take as input &NUM word senses from WordNet . 
^ These methods can be embedded in any &NAME program and will return the semantic similarity between the senses according to the requested measure . 
^ There are also support programs for generating information content values ( &NAME &NUM ) for WordNet concepts from a variety of corpora , including the &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME , or any raw text provided by a user . 
^ The information content values are required by the measures of &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME , and could also be useful in a wide range of WordNet based applications . 
^ The package also provides a simple command line interface that returns the similarity measure of &NUM given words . 
^ This is very similar to our earlier version of the Distance package . 
^ A number of switches and options have been provided to enhance the output with trace data and other information . 
^ Please download and give Similarity a try ! 
^ We anxiously await your feedback and suggestions . 
^ Thanks , &NAME and &NAME

^ 2nd &NAME WORKSHOP ON ROMANCE CORPUS LINGUISTICS 
^ Corpora and Historical Linguistics : Investigating Language Change through Corpora and &NAME 
^ organized by the Department of Romance Languages of &NAME University 
^ &NAME im &NAME ( &NAME ) , September 11th-13th , &NUM 
^ SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS 
^ The 2nd &NAME &NAME on Romance Corpus Linguistics will be dedicated to the questions how the methods and techniques of modern corpus linguistics can be put to use in order to investigate diachronic developments and language change , and which innovative insights may result from the application of corpus linguistic methods in the field of historical linguistics . 
^ Language change shall be considered , in this context , on different levels : as long-term change that modifies profoundly the language ( &CHAR ) involved , even altering its ( their ) typologic structure , processes the study of which require historical corpora of considerable extension ; and as medium- and short-term change , that emerges already from the comparison of very few text or speaker generations and for which corpora with reduced diachronic depth are sufficient . 
^ The workshop will include the following &NUM panels : 
^ * Panel &CHAR ' Corpus projects , language data management and tools for analysis ' : This panel will be open for the presentation of currently on-going or completed corpus and database projects ; the main focus will be on projects with a historical perspective on long- , medium- or short-term language change . 
^ * Panel &CHAR ' Corpus-based diachronic studies on Romance languagues ' : For this panel , contributions on diachronically oriented research on specific issues in Romance linguistics , empirically based on corpora and databases , are invited . 
^ Keynote speakers : 
^ * &NAME L' &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME / &NAME ) 
^ * &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME + &NAME , &NAME / &NAME ) 
^ * &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME &NAME da &NAME &NAME &NAME / &NAME ) 
^ * &NAME &NAME ( &NAME State University , &NAME / &NAME ) 
^ A half-day para-workshop , directed by &NAME Pr' vost ( &NAME &NAME + &NAME , &NAME / &NAME ) and &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME / &NAME ) will be organized within the conference , where the machine-readable treatment and mark-up of historical texts and diachronic language data will be exemplified , illustrated and discussed . 
^ Paper submissions : Please submit paper proposals for either of the &NUM panels by sending an abstract ( approx . 
^ &NUM words ) including your name , academic affiliation , mail and e-mail address . 
^ Abstracts in electronic form ( &NAME , MS-WORD or &NAME files ) , sent as e-mail attachments to &EMAIL are strongly encouraged . 
^ The deadline for submission of papers is March 15th , &NUM . 
^ Papers may be read in German , any Romance language , and English . 
^ Confirmation of acceptance of your paper will be sent out before March 30th , &NUM . 
^ If there are more proposals than panel slots , a part of the contributions will be presented during a poster session . 
^ For detailed information on the conference venue , the conference program , on the registration procedure and attendance fees , social program , travel and accomodation , please have a look at the conference web page at &WEBSITE registration form is available ) , or contact the workshop 's convenor :

^ Gosh , you 're quite right - I do n't think any of us spotted that possibility . 
^ Sorry . 
^ But surely the fact that we did n't spot it shows it 's not a likely reading . 
^ Personally I hardly ever use ' may ' deontically - I 'd always use ' can ' . 
^ &NAME 
^ At &NUM : &NUM &NUM / &NUM / &NUM &NUM , you wrote : 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ As &NAME , surely a better form of wording could have been found ... 
^ the sentence ' we may speak for a large body of opinion in our field because we are the past presidents of the &NAME ' is inherently ambiguous in just the way it seems the authors strove to avoid - the modal auxiliary verb ' may ' is liable to be interpreted under its deontic reading ( ie : ' we have permission / are authorised to speak for a large body etc ' ) rather than under its intended epistemic reading ( ' it is possible that we speak for a large body etc ' ) . 
^ It is precisely this ambiguity that makes me somewhat concerned that the letter 's contents may be taken to have my support , without my being consulted . 
^ &NAME &NAME University of &NAME 
^ &NAME &NAME wrote : 
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Dear &NAME , In this message I speak entirely for myself . 
^ I understand why &NAME and &NAME objected to the letter that I signed , along with all the other past presidents of the &NAME since &NUM . 
^ ( There were actually one of us , but the &NAME lost count when it cut the list . ) 
^ I 'm sorry they felt we were speaking , or could be understood to be speaking , for the &NAME , because that was certainly not my intention nor is it ( in my opinion ) even a reasonable interpretation of what we actually said : 
^ ' We are writing as &NAME in support of our colleague , Professor &NAME &NAME , who is currently under investigation by &NAME for removing &NUM &NAME members of the editorial board of a journal she privately owns and publishes . 
^ Although we write as individuals , we may speak for a large body of opinion in our field because we are the past presidents of the Linguistics Association of &NAME &NAME since &NUM . ' 
^ All we said was ' we * may * speak for a large body of opinion ' . 
^ Not that we 
^ * did * speak for a large body , less still that we spoke for the whole of the &NAME . 
^ When I signed it I thought it was a reasonable assumption that , since presidents are elected , there must be quite a lot of people who accept them as similar in values etc. When one of past presidents agree on something , it seems likely that quite a few other members would agree on it as well . 
^ Maybe I was wrong , but I do n't think any of us know . 
^ &NAME asks ' why now ? ' No particular reason ( except that Christmas had been mentioned by &NUM journalist as the deadline for the &NAME inquiry ) . 
^ Maybe we should have acted sooner . 
^ Just to remind you of the points we did and did not make in the letter : 
^ - We did * not * make any judgement on &NAME &NAME 's form of the boycott ; the rights and wrongs of this were n't at issue . 
^ - We * did * say &NAME 's treatment of her was over the top . 
^ - We * did * say we objected to &NAME 's assumption that it had the right to inquire into her private political activities . 
^ Personally I stick by the last &NUM of these points .

^ Yes , we 've evolved a DeathBot here in the Robot Lab . 
^ I used the fitness function - Minimise the number of deaths in the next &NUM years . 
^ The lifetime of the &NAME is &NUM days , it can kill as many people as it likes within those &NUM days to achieve this end . 
^ Unfortunately it came across a local minima whereby it killed everyone within the first &NUM days ( &NAME evolution ... ) . 
^ After a tweaking of this fitness function with reward in proportion to the ' &NUM / ( &NUM + ( means deaths * ends deaths ) ) ' it fails to find a solution . 
^ Any suggestions how to encode the minimum number of people it should kill in &NUM days to reduce the total in the next &NUM years ?

^ Hi -- &NAME &NAME seems to be in a tizzy after his meeting with you . 
^ I guess the point is for him to find a project that would let him develop some skills in corpus work , independent of the framework he presents his results in ? 
^ Or did you really advise him not to do a thesis in &NAME ? 
^ - &NAME 
^ Dear Doctor &NAME , 
^ I have just come back from my interview at &NAME with Doctor &NAME and Doctor &NAME . 
^ They agree to take me in. They have asked me about what I would like to do for my summer project . 
^ I tell them that I want to try testing my PhD project , that is , treating agreement as a function from semantic structures to syntactic structures , with &NAME . 
^ But then I learn that Doctor &NAME is basically a &NAME person and Doctor &NAME a Categorial Grammar person . 
^ So I suggest something to do with the &NAME system whose manual you have given me to have a look . 
^ However , Doctor &NAME suggests that the best project for me in this summer would be something that requires me to use some unix tools to do some text searching , extraction so that I can familiar myself with these skills normally possessed by &NAME graduates . 
^ Of course , I know that this is only the methodology to do a project . 
^ I still have to get a theme . 
^ The problem is I know absolutely nothing about the methodology . 
^ So I have no idea of what it is capable to do ? 
^ Can you suggest some reports of projects done by others for me to read so that I can get some ideas of what I can do ? 
^ Or do you have something that you find interesting ? 
^ Doctor &NAME asks me to say hello to you . 
^ I am looking forward to seeing you . 
^ Enjoy your trip in &NAME . 
^ Respectfully yours , &NAME &NAME &NAME

^ &NUM &NAME have asked whether they will be founder .

^ &NAME has also asked that the wording be changed so that anti-dilution applies in the event of any issue of any shares to anybody ( presumably provided this falls below the &pound; 100k funding limit . 
^ &NAME &NAME comment , it seems to me that &NAME will apply if shares are sold at a price to &NAME and &NAME at par value which is below market value , howsoever that market value is caused e.g. purchase of &NAME , or price established by new investor purchasing at a premium . 
^ I am not a tax expert . 
^ To entirely resolve any tax issues we would have to employ a full blown shareholder 's agreement having taken appropriate advice . 
^ &NUM days to decide whether to take up the shares is fine with me . 
^ &NUM ( 2iii ) The level of &pound; 100k is established as funds are difficult to obtain nowadays and onerous conditions are likely to be imposed . 
^ &NUM &NAME has asked whether we could enter into a full shareholders agreement which could apply also to any new investor . 
^ Generally I find that any substantive investor will wish to impose their own agreement whatever . 
^ I should reiterate that the draft was created on the basis that there is a shortage of funds to pay for a complex agreement and that my instructions were on the basis that a short and straightforward version would do .

^ Thanks for your responses . 
^ I take the point about ensuring &NAME is exploitable , but am still uneasy over the rather vague wording . 
^ Since we are already offering a non-commercial licence and plan to publicise a commercial one as soon as we incorporate , perhaps a simple and easily verifiable condition that we do offer and continue to offer and publicise the offer of a non-exclusive commercial licence for the &NAME software would suffice and be straightforwardly verifiable ?

^ THIRD CALL FOR PAPERS AND WORKSHOPS 
^ Corpus Linguistics &NUM will be a forum for all concerned with the computer-assisted empirical analysis of natural language . 
^ Our definition of ' corpus ' is broad , and we therefore welcome those working on substantial literary texts or other kinds of text collection as well as more ' traditional ' corpus &NAME . 
^ Similarly , we wish to encourage further cross-fertilization between work occurring in language engineering ( e.g. information extraction , parsing ) and linguistics . 
^ We believe that corpus &NAME should be aware of the late st developments in language processing .

^ The conference will include invited talks from : &NAME &NAME - &NAME and the lexicon &NAME &NAME - topic &NAME &NAME &NAME - topic &NAME &NAME &NAME - Everything you wanted to know about the American National Cor pus ... but were afraid to ask 
^ The aims of Corpus Linguistics &NUM are : 
^ &NUM to encourage dialogue between those working on similar issues in diffe rent languages and between areas with a ( perhaps as yet untapped ) potential to interact . 
^ &NUM to encourage dialogue between researchers using corpora in linguistics and those using corpora in language engineering . 
^ For the main conference , pap ers of ca . 
^ &NUM minutes are invited on topics such as : 
^ corpus-based studies of any language level in any language contrastive corpus linguistics computer-aided studies of style corpus- or text-based lexicography corpus / text building , encoding and &NAME development of corpus-based language engineering tools applications of computer-aided text analysis in non-linguistic fields ( ma rket research , advertising , media studies , sociology , psychology , etc. ) Proposals for workshops ( half day or full day ) are also invited .

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ sorry I totally dropped the ball on this email ! 
^ I 'm finally just doing my grading for the semester and am cleaning up my mailbox and found this . 
^ &NAME , I 'm swamped right now . 
^ but I think it 's a great idea , I 'd love to have an issue on semantic parsing or &NAME interpretation or something . 
^ I 'll start the process of talking to some of the other folks that are working on this and see if they think an issue would be interesting .

^ &NAME , 
^ As a member of the ed. board of &NAME Sp & &NAME , I wonder if I can interest you in being editor of a special issue ? 
^ &NAME &NAME and I are actively encouraging submission of articles in stat . 
^ &NAME and I 've arranged for a special issue on &NAME ( edited by &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME ) which shld appear 2nd quarter &NUM , hopefully capitalising on the output of Senseval-3 . 
^ However , we wld like to have at least &NUM more , also signalling a shift of emphasis away from the signal processing / lg modelling areas . 
^ I do n't have a strong feeling for what I want the issue to cover , but e.g. something in the statistical parsing area would be very appropriate . 
^ The timescale wld probably be 4th quarter &NUM , so we 'd want final versions of all papers by Sept04 suggesting first submission deadline of around end of Jan04 for comfort . 
^ Would you be prepared to edit such an issue ? 
^ -- this involves writing a ~500 word call for papers that wld both appear in the jnl and be sent to relevant lists , arranging and participating in the refereeing process , and writing a short intro to the issue . 
^ You cld either do this alone or enlist another colleague ( e.g. &NAME &NAME ? ) . 
^ It wld also be fine to submit a paper yourself ( see the recent special issue on generation ) -- in this case we wld arrange independent refereeing . 
^ You cld count on my support throughout this process , both in terms of liaising with &NAME and assisting with the refereeing , as I am sure wld the other relevantly qualified members of the editorial board ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME ... ) . 
^ &NAME handle the paper submission , formatting and copy editing side of the process . 
^ all the best ,

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ Here 's a little test prog I put together that shows a fairly easy way of using &NUM arrays : 
^ @test ; 
^ $ size_x_axis &NUM ; $ size_y_axis &NUM ; 
^ $ test [ &NAME [ &NUM ] &NUM ; $ test [ &NAME [ &NUM ] &NUM ; $ test [ &NAME [ &NUM ] &NUM ; $ test [ &NAME [ &NUM ] &NUM ; 
^ for ( $ x0 ; $ &CHAR ( $ size_x_axis ; $ x++ ) { for ( $ y0 ; $ &CHAR ( $ size_y_axis ; $ y++ ) { print $ test [ $ x] [ $ &CHAR ] . 
^ ' &CHAR ' ; 
^ output : 
^ &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM 
^ &NUM hashes are also very easy to use , in a similar way . 
^ The only funny thing about this is you only specify the size of the &CHAR and &CHAR axes for the purposes of looping - the actual arrays are allocated dynamically and implicitly by perl . 
^ Later ,

^ I 'm not at all certain how to give a &NUM array 
^ Is there a way I could just use a &CHAR like notation &NAME [ x] [ &CHAR ] - There was a suggestion on the web about a hash . 
^ undef %hash 
^ $ hash [ $ x, $ y } 
^ Is hash a reserved word or just %StateArray ?

^ Dear all 
^ As a part of a classified ads posting system , a group of natural language processing students supervised by me have to develop a gross language detection system for the Spanish language . 
^ I do not know if there is any work in this area ( except maybe [ &NUM ] ) . 
^ Dou you have ideas of how to do this ? 
^ It seems rather heuristic , but my basic idea is : 
^ &NUM To build a dictionary of forbidden words ( &CHAR * * &CHAR , etc ) 
^ &NUM To develop a set of regular expresions that allow to detect variations of the forbiden words ( e.g. if ' xyzt ' is a forbidden word , then we have to 
^ detect ' &NAME ' , ' &NAME ' or little letter changes for slang - &CHAR ' &CHAR ' instead 
^ &CHAR ' &CHAR ' , etc ) . 
^ Thank you for your help

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ The problem might be with your input files . 
^ If you , for instance , load corpus files from the first &NAME corpora &NAME ( not the &NUM version ) and choose e.g. the whole &NAME folder , you automatically load each file twice ( &WEBSITE ' to ' &WEBSITE ' . 
^ This last file includes all the other files , so you can simply load this &NUM file if you do not need to know which of the A-R texts the examples in your &NAME concorda nce come from .

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I 've read through the qa / anaphora paper and here are some comments : 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : do you really mean that ' The &NAME system recovers &NAME representations ' ? 
^ &NUM ) Tables and figures seem to be rather confused in the first half of the paper . 
^ The &NAME output should probably be &NUM huge figure with a caption ( it does n't have one now and so it merges in with the table below , it 's also odd that you 're referring to Figure &NUM when you 've never referred to Figure &NUM ) . 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : Table &NUM gives the mean reciprocal rank ... This should be Table &NUM . 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... unanswered questions by about &NUM -- you need to backslash the % sign . 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... weights selected are valid -- see Table &NUM . 
^ This should be Table &NUM ! 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : Why are the definite descriptions in Table &NUM being referred to as interD -- can you not have intraD too ? 
^ How about ' &NAME &NAME , the president of the club , ... ' ? 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... is not sufficient ( contx- , i.e. where ... Needs a ~ sign between i.e. and where - ) i.e. ~where 
^ &SMILEY Section &NUM : missing reference : 
^ @inproceedings { Kennedy : &NUM , AUTHOR ' &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME ' , TITLE ' &NAME for Everyone : &NAME &NAME Resolution without a &NAME ' , BOOKTITLE ' Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Computational Linguistics ( { COLING }' &NUM ) ' , YEAR &NUM , PAGES { 113--118 }} 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... given in Figure &NUM - ) needs to change figure number . 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : All of &NAME 's non-coreference ... Also need to add that the salience factors can be obtained from the GRs . 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : &NAME and &NAME forthcoming : rather optimistic is n't it ? 
^ Maybe it 'd be better to cite my &NAME paper . 
^ That 's got all the same results except for &NAME and is already published . 
^ @inproceedings { Preiss : &NUM , AUTHOR { J . 
^ Preiss } , TITLE { Choosing a &NAME for &NAME Resolution } , BOOKTITLE { Proceedings of DAARC } , YEAR &NUM , PAGES { 175--180 }} 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : I 'd rather not give the optimal weights . 
^ These were n't obtained from the manual re-annotation and I did n't use them in the stuff that I gave you , so it 'd invite too much criticism ( from myself if not form anyone else ! ) . 
^ &NUM ) I like your ' The results were &NAME ' ! 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : stat-of-the-art - ) state-of-the-art 
^ &NUM ) Section &NUM : ... other statistical parsers ( e.g. &NAME ... Are n't you using statistical in a rather non-technical sense ? 
^ I do n't think that you can say that &NAME ' stuff is statistical . 
^ &NAME that helps , thanks for writing the paper in the first place .

^ OK -- we also have the 100M word American &NAME Corpus now -- speak to &NAME if you ca n't find it , so it wld probably make sense to pull egs from this too .

^ &NAME got back to me just now , telling that we have n't got &NAME yet . 
^ The &NAME website ( &WEBSITE by autumn &NUM .

^ &NAME 7k sentence / ver if we are talking 5k verbs or so is not a problem but gathering / finding them maybe ! 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ There are enough occurrences in &NAME ( )300 parsed egs ) for &NUM out of &NUM Comlex verbs ( /usr / groups / dict / subcat / rasp_lexicon / in-comlex ) . 
^ I selected a number of remaining , underrepresented verbs ( from a few freq . 
^ ranges ) and checked manually with &NAME how many occurrences can be found in pdf / ps documents . 
^ I came up with the following statistics ( obviously not fully accurate , but gives a rough idea ) : 
^ &NAME &NAME # # &NUM duplicate - &NUM , &NUM &NUM reunite - &NUM , &NUM &NUM rejoice - &NUM , &NUM &NUM lighten - &NUM , &NUM 
^ &NUM misjudge - &NUM , &NUM &NUM absolve - &NUM , &NUM &NUM computerize - &NUM , &NUM &NUM sweeten - &NUM , &NUM 
^ &NUM pacify - &NUM , &NUM &NUM authenticate - &NUM , &NUM &NUM amputate- &NUM , &NUM &NUM resettle - &NUM , &NUM 
^ &NUM overstep - &NUM , &NUM &NUM embezzle - &NUM , &NUM &NUM smarten - &NUM , &NUM &NUM disinherit - &NUM , &NUM 
^ &NUM overreach - &NUM , &NUM &NUM reread - &NUM , &NUM &NUM humanize - &NUM , &NUM &NUM misquote - &NUM , &NUM 
^ &NUM inundate - &NUM , &NUM &NUM mispronounce - &NUM , &NUM &NUM abominate - &NUM &NUM reinsure - &NUM , &NUM 
^ &NUM miscall - &NUM &NUM piddle - &NUM &NUM contemn - &NUM &NUM declassify - &NUM 
^ &NUM misconduct - &NUM &NUM underspend - &NUM &NUM dissatisfy - &NUM &NUM calumniate - &NUM 
^ &NUM disinfest - &NUM &NUM asseveriate - &NUM 
^ ( some spellings / verbs could be &NAME here and explain higher freqs . ) 
^ I think it would be good to either search data from internet for all the &NUM underrepresented Comlex verbs in &NAME ( i.e. all verbs marked with frequency less than &NUM in /usr / groups / dict / subcat / rasp_lexicon / in-comlex ) , or set the &NAME freq . 
^ threshold very low ( ( &NUM occurrences ) . 
^ It might make sense to also set an upper bound on the highest freq . 
^ verbs -- perhaps somewhere around &NUM , &NUM - &NUM , &NUM raw occurrences . 
^ I do n't think we need more than that , and parsing will be faster when the data is not so huge . 
^ ... Finally , about the trip to &NAME . 
^ I asked &NAME about the budget . 
^ She gave the following figures : 
^ &NAME has a total of &NAME &NUM ( after &NAME 's trip ) &NAME / I4 has a total of &NAME &NUM 
^ Can we use &NAME / I4 for travels ? 
^ If so , me going to &NAME would exhaust &NAME , but leave some &NUM in &NAME / I4 . 
^ Perhaps still enough for you to attend &NUM or one of the conferences next year ? 
^ &NAME

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I think it definitely makes sense for me to evaluate my thing on the &NAME . 
^ Subjects should be straightforward , I 'll read up on what &NAME did for objects and obliques . 
^ My algorithm is actually more involved than her baseline . 
^ for example , it looks like the base line would &NAME anything at &NUM position as a subject . 
^ mine would n't if it was in a &NAME or appositive . 
^ similarly , the basline would probably find an object relation between every verb and &NAME in &NUM position . 
^ mine would n't if there was a relation with the next verb , for example , in ' he said [ the ball ] was &NAME ' . 
^ Also her evaluation is for all &NAME . 
^ My evaluation is for only &NUM . 
^ So I do n't think my &NUM is incompatible with her baseline of &NUM . 
^ But it makes sense for me to evaluate against her as well for my thesis . 
^ the reason I have confidence in my algo is that I 've been through the mistakes my anaphora resolution algorithm makes and they tend not to be due to incorrect &NAME labelling . 
^ I actually did the evaluation on the gold standard afterwards , when I was writing the paper . 
^ I 'm not claiming that an approach so shallow can handle all &NAME , but I think it will do ok even on the &NAME for subjects and objects . 
^ - &CHAR .

^ &NAME stopped : &NUM spam messages I 've blocked : &NUM spam messages &NAME checked : &NUM , &NUM messages 
^ &NAME : &NUM ( &NUM false positives ) Recall : &NUM ( &NUM false negatives ) 
^ &NAME uses community-based filtering : &WEBSITE The community is now more than half a million people . 
^ There are &NUM things I particularly like about &NAME : ( &NUM ) It does not use filter rules . 
^ You just install it and it works ; no tweaking rules . 
^ ( &NUM ) Its precision is perfect . 
^ It has never blocked a message that was n't spam . 
^ - &NAME . 
^ I posted a plea for help with spam a while back , so thought I 'd let you know what solution I ended up with . 
^ My big constraint was that I get most of my mail through &NAME &NAME , which requires an &NAME connection to download mail over the open &NAME . 
^ That seemed at first to rule out a lot of spam solutions . 
^ The first one I tried was &NAME Inspector , which creates and periodically updates a set of native &ORG filtering rules . 
^ This would be an elegant solution , except that effectiveness was quite low . 
^ I also found at least &NUM bug , in that it corrupted some of my existing filtering rules while producing whitelist rules from my address book . 
^ I then decided to bit the bullet and deal with the &NAME problem directly , by installing stunnel ( &WEBSITE is proxy that runs on a range of client machines . 
^ It makes the &NAME connection to external servers and provides a local server that provides a nonencrypted connection . 
^ That opened up a range of spam filtering possibilities . 
^ I ended up choosing POPFile ( &WEBSITE It has a learning capability , ability to write ( regrettably simplistic ) hard rules for handing mailing lists , and relatively simple installation . 
^ My impression was that &NAME Assassin was harder to install , but I also seriously considered that one . 
^ I 've been using POPFile for about a day and have been quite impressed . 
^ It uses naive &NAME classification on words and on some aspects of the header , and has a nice interface for labeling training data . 
^ It operates as a proxy , and can insert tags in the header and / or subject lines , so is compatible with any email program . 
^ There 's lots of ways it could be improved on both the usability and machine learning fronts , but it 's not bad at all and is already making my life much easier . 
^ It only trains on those examples you tell it to , and if I recall correctly the documentation encourages you to only train on examples it made a mistake on ( ' conservative training ' in &NAME 's sense ) .

^ They are function words and therefore it would ( maybe ? ) be even be more surprising to have &NUM identical forms here . 
^ From some preliminary tests , however , they seem very close indeed . 
^ What I am wondering about is , if I use quantitative measures , such as the z-score , what would be a sufficient difference between &NUM measures ( the point of delicacy or resolution ) to distinguish synonyms from near-synonyms ?

^ &NAME , 
^ I am looking for a large hierarchical corpus of text documents , for a research in the field of hierarchical classification . 
^ I would like to get your opinion about the followings : 
^ &NUM &NAME - &NAME Collection Version &NUM . 
^ Is it 's hierarchy deep enough to make a point when it comes to showing the dependency of classification results on the hierarchical structure of the corpus ? 
^ &NUM &NAME - Open directory project . 
^ Why are there no researchs refering to data from the &NAME ? 
^ &NUM &NAME ! 
^ - There are several works done on data which was gathered from &ORG's science hierarchy . 
^ How can I get a copy of it ? 
^ Do I need &ORG's permission ? 
^ How do I get it ? 
^ &NUM US Patents - Where can I get this one ? 
^ &NUM Any other suggestions ? 
^ Since I could not find many research works using the &NAME corpus , even though it looks like a good one for a comparison bassis among works in the field , and several works are using &ORG's science hierarchy , it seems like a good idea to have both tested and put into the research . 
^ Looking Fwd to getting your comments on those thoughts ,

^ Hi &NAME , I sent another email previous to this one but not sure if it got through ! 
^ if so ignore this email ! ! 
^ I had time to look over the article over the weekend and found a few corrections : * Section &NUM - Figure &NUM not yet included ( probably know already : ) ) * section &NUM - table numbering wrong in paragraph &NUM and &NUM - typo - ( &NAME ) vs ( &NAME ) - paragraph &NUM should end something like ' ... number of unanswered questions by about &NUM in training ( &NAME &SMILEY data . ' 
^ I 'm not sure what you require in order to get the results for your &NAME algorithm on the &NAME &NUM &NAME contexts ( section &NUM ) . 
^ If you need result ( submission ) files then let me know which &NUM and I can get them for you asap ! 
^ otherwise if you need to alter my code you can access my unix account using : user name : &NAME passwd : &NUM
^ I made a back up of my &NAME directory in my home directory - in a directory called ' &NAME ' ! ! : The &NAME file lets you know which files are which - the &WEBSITE c++ file - the options for which are in an appendix in my writeup . 
^ To compile after changing the &WEBSITE file ( just a script file ) to &WEBSITE are example scripts that take a question number as input ( the position of the question 's &NAME structure in the compiled &NAME file - numbering starts from &NUM ) 
^ I will be leaving tomorrow and it will take me a few days ( ! ) to get back over that side of the world ! 
^ but if you have any questions I 'll check my email tonight and when I get back too ! 
^ I 'm not sure how much time I 'll be able to spend on coding if you need me to interface with your code given this paper is due during exam time ! 
^ But I can probably come in and spend a morning in the labs with you if you need me to .

^ If you are making grant application to a Research Council which has a large equipment component please read on . 
^ &NAME have recently turned down such an application ( from &NAME ) on the grounds that large items of equipment should be funded through the &NAME ( Scientific Research Infrastructure Fund ) &NUM initiative . 
^ This is causing the University to think about allocating some of its &NAME money for equipment --- possibly as much as 10M . 
^ We do n't know how much they will allocate , but a reasonable guess is that the &ORG will be able to bid for between &NAME and &NAME . 
^ The rules on what you can bid for are pretty simple : 
^ &CHAR ) anything that is coupled to a research application ( but I assume if the application is unsuccessful you lose the &NAME allocation ? ? ? )

^ Theories of evolution of human cognition suggest very plausibly that the neocortex was evolved because of complex societies of our ancestors ( vertebrates with high neocortex / body ratio have complex societies ) . 
^ The society makes the individuals more complex , their abilities make the society more complex ... And all characteristics of human cognition are strongly linked to social abilities ( e.g. abstractly think what the other is thinking I am thinking , etc. ) 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>

^ This causal link is n't clear . 
^ It could just as easily be that larger brains ( evolved due to some other pressure ) enabled individuals to perform tasks leading to more complex social structures . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Yes , in the beginning . 
^ But once you have a complex society , there is a positive feedback which presses the individuals to develop ' better ' social skills , which in turn makes the society more complex , and so on ... 
^ It would be interesting to see which constrains could break this feedback ... probably lack of environmental resources could limit population sizes ... or on the other hand , if the resources are plenty enough , and you are already ' clever ' enough , you can survive being lazy and watch Big Brother all day ...

^ I will be coming to College for 11am tomorrow ( Thursday ) and can bring keys for anyone in College .

^ Hey there , 
^ &NAME is an &NAME document type ; it includes some features ( namely opening tags appearing without closing tags and attribute values appearing without surrounding quotation marks ) that do not constitute well-formed &NAME . 
^ &NAME is precisely a version of &NAME that has been designed to be conforming &NAME . 
^ The osx program , part of the &NAME package ( a successor to &NAME &NAME 's sp package ) can automatically convert &NAME files to corresponding &NAME files ; you could give that a try . 
^ &NAME is maintained along with &NAME ( &WEBSITE 
^ I believe osx is written in C++ ... 
^ You should be able to validate the resulting &NAME documents against the &NAME &NAME , although I would imagine you 'll need to make minor changes for full validity . 
^ &NAME that helps .

^ Let me know . 
^ Thanks for the resolution corrections , most were OK according to my &NAME criteria : 
^ I only resolved third person pronouns , that 's why ' you ' was n't linked . 
^ Antecedents were only chosen from available noun phrases , so if the tagger got a part of speech wrong , a pronoun may have been assigned antecedent_does_not_exist . 
^ What 's the difference between xmods and xcomps ? 
^ I 've been trying to get my Re-implemented &NAME software to output basically all relations , but I 'm really struggling with the comps and mods . 
^ I do n't seem to be able to find a distinguishing pattern myself , so I ca n't get a computer to do it ! 
^ E.g. the xmods / xcomps with ' to ' : 
^ xcomp to wanted wait xmod to wait make 
^ in ' ... wanted to wait to make ... ' 
^ How can you have : 
^ xcomop to continue place 
^ but

^ The first point is obvious if one contemplates trying to do psycholinguistic experiments with the data . 
^ It would for example seriously compromise a comprehension study if proper names are bleeped out , or even replaced by others . 
^ No psychology reviewer would ever accept that such data is as naturalistic as untreated data . 
^ The second point is almost as obvious , because humans are adept at inferring personal identity from all kinds of things , including voice quality , ear shape , gait and so on . 
^ Therefore , whatever &NUM does , short of blanking everything out , it is difficult to credibly claim that the risk of unintended identification has been avoided . 
^ &NAME &NAME 's &NAME documentation makes the case that such identification is highly undesirable . 
^ The only way I can see to handle this is to deal with the problem at the outset by making completely clear to participants what will happen to their data , and obtaining informed consent . 
^ If this is not done , the data is effectively lost to responsible researchers , and cannot be used except at risk of infringing participants rights . 
^ If , as in the case &NAME has , promises have been made to participants , those promises must be honoured . 
^ It may or may not be possible to recover data that is both useful and distributable under these circumstances . 
^ The same difficulties are also present for audio ( the &NAME audio has never been distributed , even though it exists ) . 
^ The risk of identification is just too great and the consequences of that too severe to be acceptable . 
^ Although the visual cues to identity are absent , speaking style persists . 
^ One may feel that the risks are less , but they still exist . 
^ And , here 's the rub , the same arguments apply , albeit more weakly , to text-only corpora . 
^ While voice quality is now absent , substantial cues to personal identity may persist in lexis and other idiosyncrasies , not to mention that people are extremely adept at reconstructing material from context . 
^ Once again , the risks are arguably less than in the other media , but they still exist . 
^ So , notwithstanding valiant efforts to anonymise in such a way that the scientific usefulness of the data is preserved , the original decision to promise anonymity comes back to haunt us . 
^ I lean to the view that there is no difference of principle between the different media . 
^ Is even &NAME 's rigorous approach to anonymization enough in practice ? 
^ Perhaps , but that depends on a very iffy judgement call . 
^ The lesson seems to be that great care is needed in collecting informed consent for corpus work . 
^ None of this addresses the additional point made in &NAME 's post about collateral damage to people and organisations not involved in the recording . 
^ I could imagine a prosecution against both participants and corpus distributors for defamation or slander . 
^ That would be bad . 
^ Perhaps corpus collectors need to indemnify participants against this , or perhaps it suffices to warn people that they are ( in effect ) speaking in a public place . 
^ Or perhaps we have a duty of care to ensure that our participants do not put themselves at risk ( doubly likely since many corpora include contributions by children ) . 
^ And that leaves aside the much more likely cases where nasty stuff in the corpus evokes resentment and unhappiness , but not enough to lead to prosecutions .

^ On &NAME &NAME 's posting , to me there is an important difference between ' bad language ' and individuals ' names , or information that could lead to identification of individuals . 
^ Like &NAME &NAME , I do n't believe there is any real reason to censor the ' bad language ' ; it is important linguistic data , and we are all grown-ups . 
^ But I do think that before such a resource is made public , strenuous efforts should be made to eliminate any possibility of users identifying either the individuals who produced the material , or any individuals or individual institutions written about . 
^ Actually , under various national Data Protection laws I suspect it might be illegal not to do this , even if the material is simply held at &NUM institution and not circulated . 
^ But it ought to be done anyway , for reasons that I discuss at some length in the ' ethics ' section of the documention file accompanying my &NAME Corpus ( available via the Web , from my home page &WEBSITE CHRISTINE ) . 
^ I discuss there what seems to me to have been inadequate practice in this respect in the spoken section of the British National Corpus . 
^ There are places where really damaging things are said in a quite casual way in conversation about people , or organizations , who / which might easily be identified by people who know them ( and could probably be identified by strangers with only minimal detective work ) . 
^ The recorded speakers had no motive to worry about this , but I believe corpus &NAME have a responsibility not to let such casual gossip about identifiable people be turned into permanent public records .

<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Dear all 
^ I have seen in several paper that very rare terms ( e.g. those ocurring in 
^ less than &NUM to &NUM documents ) are often deleted from the representation of documents for text categorization . 
^ I am on the need of doing the same , because I am working now on a big number of documents for a binary classification problem , and the indexing of documents for learning is qui te slow . 
^ According to &NAME 's law , if you delete terms ocurring in less than &CHAR documents , you will get much less terms and indexing will be much faster . 
^ After indexing , I am applying term selection with Information Gain . 
^ I plan to keep about &NUM to &NUM of the original terms . 
^ If I prevoiusly delete those ocurring in less than &CHAR documents , I will probably not miss any top scoring term , but I would like to have a theoretical background to so it safely . 
^ So , is there any theoretical result that allows to delete terms occurring 
^ in less than &CHAR documents , that supports there will be no miss of information for a rather balanced and large binary classification dataset 
^ Thank you

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ &NAME , &NAME is a form of &NAME , is n't it ? 
^ For converting between different &NAME specs ( as defined by a &NAME or &NAME &NAME ) , you should take a look at &NAME ( &NAME transforms ) . 
^ This is an XML-based programming language . 
^ There are quite a few &NAME processors out there that include &NAME libraries , such as Saxon and &NAME . 
^ You write the &NAME , and apply the &NAME to the input &NAME to generate the output &NAME . 
^ Check out &NAME , &NAME and &NAME Schemas at the &NAME ( &WEBSITE

^ Dear Fellows and Staff 
^ A number of you have asked for guidance on whom to contact in College now that we have no Domestic &NAME . 
^ I am hoping to compile an indexed guide during the &NAME , but for now , perhaps the following will be of help . 
^ Most aspects of college life previously co-ordinated by the Domestic &NAME are now being run by Heads of Departments , and co-ordinated through the Heads of Departments Committee . 
^ I have listed individual members below , with job titles and contact details . 
^ If you prefer , you may contact &NAME &NAME , who is the secretary to the committee : email &EMAIL or &NAME &NUM and she will put items of business onto the next committee agenda or , if urgent , forward them to the appropriate departmental head . 
^ &NAME is the Maintenance secretary and uses the Maintenance pigeonhole in College . 
^ The Heads of &NAME &WEBSITE chair of the committee is the &NAME &NAME and he attends Council on behalf of the committee . 
^ Heads of Departments who previously reported to the Domestic &NAME now report to the &NAME and I act as a sort of go-between . 
^ I hope this is helpful - do let me know if you need any other information at this stage or if you are aware of any aspects of college life not covered by the new arrangement .

^ sorry meant to send this . 
^ It 's my abstract for &NAME . 
^ &NAME &NAME - &NAME University 
^ &EMAIL 
^ &ORG &NAME &NAME Building &NUM &NAME &NAME Avenue &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ A Computational Model for Lexical Acquisition of a Categorial Grammar 
^ A model of lexical acquisition has been developed in order to learn both the semantic and syntactic category of lexemes associated with a generalised categorial grammar . 
^ Computational simulation shows that acquisition is possible when some prior language knowledge is assumed . 
^ The effects on acquisition have been explored when aspects of this prior knowledge are varied . 
^ At this conference &CHAR would present the acquisition model , focusing particularly on the novel syntax learner , as well as the results of acquisition experiments that have been run from different starting points in terms of the prior knowledge assumed . 
^ In child language acquisition theory it has been suggested that children have an innate ability to recognise the category of particular types of words and this ability in turn helps them to determine the category of other words . 
^ Whether this innate ability to categorise applies to ' names and object words ' or ' actions words ' has been much discussed . 
^ The difference in acquisition rate in each case is investigated . 
^ The method assumes a pipelined approach to acquisition . 
^ Each utterance in turn is first processed for the acquisition of semantic information and subsequently for the acquisition of syntactic information . 
^ It is assumed that this is compatible with children 's behaviour . 
^ It is likely that children acquire all the information they can from an utterance when they hear it and then discard it . 
^ It would be impractical for the child to store many utterances to process later . 
^ The syntactic learner relies on output from the semantic learner . 
^ This also echos children 's behaviour since they pass through a single word acquisition phase before they begin to acquire syntax . 
^ The semantic learner produces a mapping between words and their semantic representation using , amongst others , the theories of cross-situational learning and covering constraints and is based on &NAME 's work on &NAME &NAME Techniques . 
^ A fundamental assumption is employed to link the &NUM learners ; the number of words that the semantic category of a word is dependent upon is the same as the number of words that the syntactic category is dependent upon . 
^ The syntactic learner attempts to create valid parse trees for the categorial grammar thus resolving unknowns in the syntactic category types . 
^ This is achieved by first assigning skeleton categories to words in the current utterance - using the fundamental assumption in conjunction with information already extracted by the semantic learner . 
^ All possible binary tree structures for the utterance are then considered . 
^ &NAME trees are discarded whilst any valid trees add weighting to the syntactic categories of words at their leaf nodes . 
^ For a very simple example consider the sentence ' The grinch cries ' . 
^ Using the scenario where children have an innate ability to recognise names and objects , we already know that : 
^ ' grinch ' is of semantic category &NAME and syntactic category &CHAR , 
^ In order to find a skeleton category for the remaining words we look at their semantic category and then apply the fundamental assumption : 
^ ' the ' has semantic category THE ( &CHAR ) and syntactic category x|y ' cries ' has semantic category &NAME ( &CHAR ) and syntactic category u|v 
^ where | is used to represent either forward or backward application and &CHAR , &CHAR , &CHAR , &CHAR are syntactic categories ( which may be either atomic or complex ) . 
^ A possible parse tree for this sentence is : 
^ &CHAR ? 
^ u|v / ' cries ' x|y &CHAR ' The ' ' &NAME ' 
^ The syntax learner could then discover the following unknowns : 
^ &CHAR &CHAR sx / ' cries ' &CHAR / &CHAR &CHAR ' The ' ' &NAME ' 
^ The input to the system is a collection of utterances paired with semantic representations . 
^ These semantic representations are the hypothesised meanings a child may assume for an utterance . 
^ The correct interpretation may or may not be included amongst the semantic representations . 
^ The affect of this type of noise on the system may also be investigated . 
^ Children learn their native tongue because it is the language of their environment . 
^ In the early stages of acquisition the only language that children are exposed to is that of their caketakers . 
^ This implies that the caretakers ' utterances are the only input needed to begin acquisition . 
^ To mirror this situation , from which children actually learn , I use real data ; the interaction between a child and her parents . 
^ Since the child involved did successfully learn English , it is reasonable to assume that the utterances the child heard the parents say are sufficient for learning ( provided a capable model and correct starting assumptions can be found ) . 
^ The &NAME 's Corpus of the &NAME database has been used for this work . 
^ The corpus contains a selection of interactions between a child and her parents from the age of &NUM year &NUM month to &NUM years and &NUM month . 
^ The corpus has been preprocessed by &NAME . 
^ All phonological annotations and grammatical structures not covered by her grammar , including interjections and elliptical material , have been removed . 
^ The child 's sentences were also excluded from those remaining so that the parents ' sentences only are given as input to the system . 
^ The learner has been run on the first &NUM utterances of the corpus . 
^ The semantics learner will currently achieve recall of &NUM with precision &NUM . 
^ The syntactic learner is dependant upon the recall of the semantic learner in that it can only proceed when a skeleton syntactic category is available for every word in the utterance ; when this is the case the success rate is high with precision in the high &NAME . 
^ A previous investigation into lexical acquisition in the framework of a categorial grammar was discussed by &NAME . 
^ His approach differs from this in several respects . 
^ &NAME 's syntactic learner was entirely algebraic in nature ; the syntactic categories were derived by solving a set of simultaneous equations . 
^ In order to constrain his search space &NAME had to specify the syntactic categories allowed . 
^ This meant defining a category set before learning began . 
^ This is equivalent to assuming a child has innate knowledge of which syntactic categories are allowed in it 's language . 
^ The learner presented here is not restricted in this way . 
^ &NAME 's learner was used in conjunction with a parameter setting system ( &NAME ) in order to &NAME hypothesised category sets . 
^ For this purpose the learner was successful but &NAME still made several assumptions that would correspond to innate language ability in a child . 
^ In order to investigate these assumptions a new learning model is needed . 
^ The learner presented can acquire language from reasonably little prior knowledge and as a result the effects on learning rate as introduced by these and other assumptions can be investigated .

^ CORPUS LINGUISTICS &NUM 
^ &NAME University ( UK ) , &NUM - &NUM March &NUM 
^ CALL FOR PARTICIPANTS 
^ Corpus Linguistics &NUM will be a forum for all concerned with the computer-assisted empirical analysis of natural language . 
^ Our definition of ' corpus ' is broad , and we therefore welcome those working on substantial literary texts or other kinds of text collection as well as more ' traditional ' corpus &NAME . 
^ Similarly , we wish to encourage further cross-fertilization between work occurring in language engineering ( e.g. information extraction , parsing ) and linguistics . 
^ We believe that corpus &NAME should be aware of the latest developments in language processing . 
^ We also believe that language engineers should be aware of the findings and needs of corpus &NAME . 
^ The conference will include invited talks from : &NAME &NAME - Corpora and the lexicon &NAME &NAME - topic &NAME &NAME &NAME - &NAME , phrase , or function : a comparison between frame semantics and local grammars &NAME &NAME - Everything you wanted to know about the American National Corpus ... but were afraid to ask 
^ There will be &NUM pre-conference workshops : 
^ Corpus-Based Approaches to Figurative Language Learner Corpora : Design , Development and &NAME &NAME Corpora : Linguistic Requirements and Technical Perspectives Shallow Processing of Large Corpora ( &NAME &NUM ) 
^ Details of the workshops , and the more than &NUM accepted papers and posters are available on the conference website : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ The aims of Corpus Linguistics &NUM are : 
^ &NUM to encourage dialogue between those working on similar issues in different languages and between areas with a ( perhaps as yet untapped ) potential to interact . 
^ &NUM to encourage dialogue between researchers using corpora in linguistics and those using corpora in language engineering .

^ Hi &NAME , how 's life ? 
^ How 's the teaching going ? 
^ I am listening to ' &NAME ' by Jars of &NAME on my &NAME player at the moment - I remember you used to like it . 
^ Actually , I think ' If I Left the &NAME ' is probably my favourite album of all time ; I just ca n't seem to get tired of listening to it ! 
^ It often reminds me of the ' MOG ' . 
^ I had such a good time doing that - it was a great idea of yours . 
^ I 'm enjoying my project work at the moment - quite a cushy life really . 
^ I work hard , but only during fairly civil hours ! 
^ I spoke to &NAME the other day - seems like ( as per ) she 's been through some pretty catastrophic stuff recently ! 
^ I met &NAME &NAME 's brother in &NAME bar the other day ( &NAME ) ! 
^ He 's at &NAME , and just about to finish his first year . 
^ I knew I recognised him from somewhere but I just could n't think where . 
^ Then he asked me if I 'd been at &NAME University and it suddenly clicked into place . 
^ Anyway , hope you 're well . 
^ Love &NAME

^ &NAME 
^ This workshop clearly falls within the scope of &NAME and my initial reaction to your email is very positive . 
^ To move forwards , we need more information 
^ &CHAR ) We will need the names of the guest editors to be appointed - preferably &NUM . 
^ &CHAR ) We need a draft schedule to publication so that we can identify the best issue to allocate to you . 
^ I assume that you will select authors at or around the time of the workshop . 
^ You then need to give them time to produce the full paper , send it out to referees , allow revisions , final review and accept . 
^ ( This looks to me like 4th quarter &NUM or 1st quarter &NUM ) 
^ &CHAR ) A single issue of &NAME will accommodate &NUM or &NUM papers . 
^ To accommodate more we would have to make it a double issue . 
^ How many papers do you anticipate accepting ? 
^ If you can answer the above , then the editors can make a final decision . 
^ Note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to &NAME . 
^ Each accepted paper must have been reviewed by &NUM independent reviewers . 
^ The guest editors make the accept / reject decision but one of the regular &NAME editors is assigned to assist in the process ( probably me in this case ) . 
^ If you have detailed questions about publication procedures , please contact &NAME van der &NAME at &NAME ( for email see cc list ) .

^ &NAME , 
^ I 've been asked to follow-up some previous emails ( copied below ) . 
^ In brief , &NAME ' &NUM and &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM workshops are seeking a journal special issue . 
^ The relevant &NAME is attached . 
^ In essence we 'd like to repeat the successful previous &NAME practice : selected papers for a journal SI . 
^ Last time it was with &NAME and this time we 'd like a more speech related one , our first preference being &NAME . 
^ A key factor is publication date : this should be as soon after &NAME date ( &NAME &NUM ) as possible . 
^ What are your thoughts ?

^ &NAME , I 'm sorry for the delay in response . 
^ I 'm actually stepping down from being editor of &NAME at the end of June , so I 'm not sure that I should have much of a role in the decision . 
^ I 'm cc-ing &NAME on this email and will try to talk to him about it in the next couple weeks . 
^ We were interested earlier , but we are getting a bit of a backlog , so we need to look at that to assess whether the timing still makes sense . 
^ &NAME 
^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I believe that we approached you some time ago to investigate the possibility of a special issue of the Computer Speech & Language journal on &NAME &NUM : The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop ( I 've attached the draft &NAME with more details ) . 
^ ( Given that the &NAME &NAME ' &NUM Workshop will be held in conjunction with &NAME ' &NUM , we might want to consider including papers from both workshops in the special issue . ) I recall you being favorable to our query , although we had not yet formulated a real proposal . 
^ Can you still accommodate us ? 
^ If so , under what parameters / conditions ( e.g. , turn around time , page count , page size , guest editor / &CHAR ) ? 
^ Are you also working under &NAME van der &NAME and , if so , would you like me to ask her about this ? 
^ We published a special issue of &NAME journal using an expedited round-robin review process on the &NAME Speaker &NAME &NAME &NUM that was published as almost &NUM &NAME &NAME ' pages in a triple volume within only a few months .

^ Dear Prof. &NAME , I am a &NAME senior writing a thesis on &NAME &NAME 's attacks on &NAME linguistics as a science , as represented in his book _Empirical Linguistics_ . 
^ As he refers to &NUM articles of yours ( ' English noun phrases are regular : a reply to Professor &NAME ' &NUM ; ' Robust stochastic parsing using the inside-outside algorithm ' &NUM ) I was wondering if you could possibly forward to me copies of these articles or any other that you might think useful to me , or if you could otherwise direct me to them .

^ Hi &NAME , a quick question : 
^ I have been looking at perplexity values for the LMs I 've generated , and I find that on the whole the test set perplexities for the bigrams are significantly higher than for the unigrams . 
^ This is undoubtedly due to the fact that whenever a bigram is unseen , I backoff to the unigram distribution , but since the probabilities are calculated over the discounted probability mass , they are much lower than in the standard unigram case . 
^ However , the bigrams still perform significantly better , because even though the backed-off unigram probabilities are much smaller , they are still correctly proportioned . 
^ Thus , it seems that comparing perplexities for different ngrams is basically pointless - what do you think ?

^ I 'm being asked to offer feedback through the royal academy of engineering , on government policy on HE . 
^ ( see below ) 
^ I 'd appreciate any comments anyone has 
^ ( I nearly missed this as the &NAME Lock in the original subject line below triggered a high level of spam ... &SMILEY 
^ - ------ Forwarded Message 
^ To : ' ' &EMAIL '' ( &EMAIL ) Subject : THE FUTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION - From Dr &NAME &NAME , &NAME &CHAR Manager Engineering Policy &NAME : Wed , &NUM &NAME &NUM &NUM : &NUM : &NUM &NUM 
^ The Future of Higher Education 
^ The government recently released its White Paper on the ' Future of Higher Education ' , an extensive document detailing its proposals to restructure and fund the HE sector over the next &NUM years , building up what it claims to be a ' radical picture of a freer future ' . 
^ The report can be accessed on the website of the Department for Education and Skills at &WEBSITE 
^ Although media attention has focussed on deferred financial contributions from graduates and allowing institutions to set their own course fees , the paper also covers many other areas regarding the expansion , funding , and assessment of higher education institutes . 
^ There are many points that could be made about the proposed reforms , but the most important issues are presented in the attached annex . 
^ It is believed important that The &NAME &NAME of Engineering should comment on the White Paper , and I am writing to a number of Fellows seeking views from which a response may be prepared . 
^ The attached outline should be used as a guide , although please do not feel that it is necessary to comment on all areas , as we are aware that it is extensive . 
^ Any additional points you have to make regarding the White Paper would be most welcome . 
^ I would appreciate if any responses could reach me by Monday 17th March , and look forward to hearing your opinions on this matter . 
^ Yours , 
^ &NAME &NAME 
^ &NUM Expansion 
^ a. Must the sector expand any further ? 
^ Are there benefits in having &NUM of the population aged &NUM undertake a University degree ? 
^ b. The government 's initiatives to promote fair access include : reforming the funding scheme , providing grants for students from lower income families , and appointing an independent Access Regulator to oversee admissions . 
^ Are these measures enough ? 
^ What should the government do to promote fair access to higher education ? 
^ c. Is the appointment of an independent Access Regulator welcomed ? 
^ d. The bulk of expansion will be towards more two-year work-focused foundation degrees . 
^ Are these a good idea ? 
^ &NUM Education and the Business Economy 
^ a. The report makes much of ' harnessing knowledge to wealth creation ' . 
^ Is the present government 's focus on the financial benefits of a university education , and financial returns from university research damaging ? 
^ Can the benefits of academia , whether research or teaching , be measured in purely financial terms ? 
^ b. In order to encourage the transfer of knowledge and technologies between academia and business the government is setting up a network of ' Knowledge Exchanges ' , and increasing the funding to the Higher Education Innovation Fund . 
^ Are such initiatives worthwhile , or would the funding be better spent in other ways ? 
^ &NUM Funding of Infrastructure and Teaching 
^ a. The government is aiming to ' undo the years of under-investment ' in higher education . 
^ This is to be accomplished by increasing the funding available by more than &NUM percent over the next &NUM years , developing incentives to support and improve research , investing more in leading research departments , and increasing spending on research . 
^ Are these measures enough ? 
^ Are the figures the government provides enough to reverse the trend of under investment in this sector ? 
^ b. Should universities be allowed to set their own fees ( or ' Graduate Contributions ' ) per course ? 
^ Is it fair to tie such fees to an Access &NAME ? 
^ &CHAR . 
^ Can the government do more to encourage the creation of endowment funds ? 
^ &NUM Student Finance 
^ a. Are the proposals for student finance fair ? 
^ Is it reasonable to ask students to contribute to their education by paying fees ? 
^ Is a deferred contribution the best way to administer this ? 
^ b. &NAME the current proposals to increase student debt act as a deterrent to students contemplating entry into higher education ? 
^ Is the introduction of higher levels of student debt at odds with the governments aim to increase access to universities ? 
^ c. The proposals for student debt do not take into consideration the fact that a large proportion of women take career breaks to raise a family . 
^ With the average salary for women graduates lower than that of men , this would mean that most women would take longer to pay back their student debts than their male counterparts . 
^ Does the governments proposals for deferred contributions disadvantage women ? 
^ &NUM Research Assessment 
^ a. The government aims to develop criteria to assess the strength and quality of research . 
^ Is this necessary , or welcomed ? 
^ Should the government be directly involved in the choice of the type of research that is funded ? 
^ b. Is creating a new ' &NUM * ' category in the Research Assessment Exercise necessary ? 
^ &NUM . 
^ Teaching 
^ a. The government has proposed new national professional standards for teaching , and a new body to develop and promote good teaching - the &NAME &NAME &NAME . 
^ Are these welcomed ? 
^ b. The government has proposed a national training programme for external examiners . 
^ Is this necessary ? 
^ c. The University title will be made dependent on teaching degree awarding powers , meaning it will no longer be necessary to have research degree awarding powers to become a university . 
^ Is it wise to divorce teaching and research in this manner ? 
^ Should a ' University ' have to award research as well as teaching degrees ? 
^ d. Is there a demand for the establishment of an independent adjudicator to deal with student complaints ? 
^ Should government provide legislation for this ? 
^ &NUM Are there any other points that you think should be raised regarding this paper ?

^ ( apologies for duplicates ; note &NAME &NAME will be our invited speaker ) 
^ FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS 
^ CoNLL-2003 : &NAME Conference on Natural Language Learning 
^ Organized at &ORG-03 , &NAME , &NAME 
^ May &NUM - June &NUM &NUM 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME is an international forum for discussion and presentation of research on natural language learning . 
^ We invite submission of papers about natural language learning topics , including , but not limited to : 
^ - Computational models of human language acquisition - Computational models of the origins and evolution of language - &NAME learning methods applied to natural language processing tasks ( speech processing , phonology , morphology , syntax , semantics , discourse processing , language engineering applications ) - &NAME learning methods ( Rule Induction and Decision &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , Inductive Logic &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME ) - Biologically-inspired methods ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME ) - Statistical methods ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME , maximum entropy , &NAME , Support Vector Machines ) - &NAME &NAME - &NAME learning , ensemble methods , meta-learning - &NAME &NAME &NAME analysis of language learning - Empirical and theoretical comparisons of language learning methods - Models of induction and analogy in &NAME 
^ &NAME is the yearly meeting organized by &NAME , the &ORG Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning . 
^ Previous &NAME meetings were held in &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) &NAME ( &NUM ) , &NAME ( &NUM ) , and &NAME ( &NUM ) . 
^ See &WEBSITE 
^ for more information about &NAME and &NAME . 
^ Special Theme 
^ As in previous years , in addition to submissions on the general topics listed above , we encourage submissions on a special theme . 
^ This year 's special theme is : 
^ Semi-supervised / unsupervised learning and sample selection techniques for language learning ( co-training , active learning , &NAME , etc ) . 
^ Supervised &NAME &NAME methods suffer from a ' data &NAME bottleneck ' which is especially harmful for language learning tasks where a lot of training data is needed ( e.g. parsing ) . 
^ Sample selection techniques , and combination of supervised learning with semi-supervised and unsupervised techniques may provide a solution to this problem . 
^ Shared &NAME 
^ This year 's workshop will also accept submissions for a shared task : machine learning approaches to named entity recognition . 
^ Special attention will be given to the use of multiple sources of knowledge , like training data , lists of examples and unannotated data . 
^ Interested groups will be supplied with the same training and testing material ( in several languages ) , and will all use the same evaluation criteria , thus allowing comparison between various learning methods . 
^ More information on the shared task is available at : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ Invited Speaker 
^ &NAME ABNEY Understanding the &NAME &NAME

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ The problem might be with your input files . 
^ If you , for instance , load corpus files from the first &NAME corpora &NAME ( not the &NUM version ) and choose e.g. the whole &NAME folder , you automatically load each file twice ( &WEBSITE ' to ' &WEBSITE ' . 
^ This last file includes all the other files , so you can simply load this &NUM file if you do not need to know which of the A-R texts the examples in your &NAME concordance come from . 
^ Happy Christmas to you and to everyone else on the list !

^ In fact , you are only slightly below the pass &NAME , so while we 'd hope that you could do much better next year , it 's not the case that you have to make up a large gap to pass .

^ [ &NAME if you receive multiple copies of this call . 
^ ] 
^ Call for papers for the special issue of the &NAME journal ( 2nd call ) 
^ &NAME : &NAME in &NAME 
^ Submission deadline : May 9th &NUM 
^ &NAME &NAME : C9ric de la &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME is a very important component in Natural Language Processing . 
^ It still raises many problems , for instance at the level grammatical formalisms or at the level of the algorithmic complexity , especially to handle ambiguity . 
^ However , because of recent advances , parsers are nowadays more and more widely used in large scale applications . 
^ Many approaches exist in the &NAME community that differ on the methods and objectives . 
^ The methods include for instance stochastic parsing , local parsing cascades , or more traditional complete or deep parsing . 
^ &NAME range from segmentation into chunks to deep parsing based on wide coverage grammars , including shallow and / or robust parsing . 
^ Anyway , these various methods and objectives are not necessarily in opposition and may be perceived as complementary . 
^ Despite the large number of existing grammatical formalisms , there are hints of convergences between them which open ways for ( partial ) conversions between formalisms ( for instance between &NAME and &NAME or &NAME and &NAME ) or toward ' operational ' formalisms . 
^ Also , some parsing techniques are ' generic ' and may be applied for several formalisms . 
^ Some parsing systems also aim to be multi-formalisms , relying on generic and efficient infrastructures ( indexing , memory management by structure sharing or copying , powerful unification ) . 
^ Finally , the notion of lexicalization is present in most formalisms . 
^ Last but not least , the generalization of parsers raises the issue of their evaluation . 
^ &NAME : 
^ The main objective of this special issue is a better understanding of the various approaches and techniques found in &NAME , highlighting the convergences and complementarities that may exist between them . 
^ We welcome works on any of the following issues . 
^ * Convergence between grammatical formalisms * conversions of formalisms * operational formalisms vs declarative &NUM 
^ * Convergence and complementarity in parsing approaches * robustness ( unknown words , error corrections ) * lexicalization * Integration of stochastic methods * Cascade parsing vs one-pass parsing 
^ * Evolution of parsing techniques for new formalisms 
^ * ( generic ) &NAME in &NAME * parsing strategies * ambiguity management * chart indexing * memory management ( structure sharing and copying ) 
^ * Wide coverage grammars * parsing efficiency * maintenance and modularity 
^ * &NAME evaluation

^ CALL FOR PAPERS -- note extended deadline 
^ Human Language Technology for the Semantic Web and Web Services 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ Workshop at &NAME &NUM International Semantic Web Conference &NAME Island , &NAME , &NUM October &NUM 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ The Semantic Web aims to add a machine tractable , re-purposeable layer to compliment the existing web of natural language hypertext . 
^ In order to realise this vision , the creation of semantic &NAME , the linking of web pages to ontologies , and the creation , evolution and interrelation of ontologies must become automatic or semi-automatic processes . 
^ In the context of new work on distributed computation , Semantic Web Services ( &NAME ) go beyond current services by adding ontologies and formal knowledge to support description , discovery , negotiation , mediation and composition . 
^ This formal knowledge is often strongly related to informal materials . 
^ For example , a service for multi-media content delivery over broadband networks might incorporate conceptual indices of the content , so that a smart &NAME ( such as next generation &NAME ) can reason about programmes to suggest to its owner . 
^ Alternatively , a service for &NAME catalogue publication has to translate between existing semi-structured catalogues and the more formal catalogues required for &NAME purposes . 
^ To make these types of services cost-effective we need automatic knowledge harvesting from all forms of content that contain natural language text or spoken data . 
^ Other services do not have this close connection with informal content , or will be created from scratch using Semantic Web authoring tools . 
^ For example , printing or compute cycle or storage services . 
^ In these cases the opposite need is present : to document services for the human reader using natural language generation . 
^ This workshop will provide a forum for workers in the field of human language technology for the Semantic Web and for Semantic Web Services to present their latest results . 
^ The aim is to provide a snapshot of the state of the art , dealing with a wide range of issues , including but not limited to : 
^ * automatic and semi-automatic &NAME of web pages ; 
^ * semantic indexing and retrieval of documents , combining the strengths of &NAME and &NAME ; 
^ * integration of data about language in language processing components with ontological data ; 
^ * robustness across genres and domains ; 
^ * ease of embedding in Semantic Web applications ; 
^ * ontology learning , evolving and merging ; 
^ * automatic web service description augmentation ; 
^ * automatic semantic structure documentation ; 
^ * language technology for automatic Web service discovery ; 
^ * adaptation of generation techniques to &NAME applications . 
^ The themes of the workshop have partly emerged from the Special Interest Group on Language Technologies and the Semantic Web ( SIG5 ) , part of the &NAME thematic network ( &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME : 
^ The issues addressed by the workshop are at the core of the Semantic Web enterprise . 
^ The killer applications that demonstrate the potential of this technology to a mass market have yet to emerge , and will likely not do so until a much larger amount of data is available . 
^ The techniques covered by this workshop are one of the most important routes to generating this data . 
^ The workshop is relevant to : 
^ * researchers from the Human Language Technology areas ; 
^ * researchers from the Ontology and Knowledge Acquisition and Management areas ; 
^ * industrial technology providers involved in Knowledge Management , Information Integration , Information and Library Science , Web Services .

^ That 's fine as a way of getting the same result faster . 
^ &NAME may be saying that it seems fishy to threshold on the numerator . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ No I 'm not saying that although ( or because ) I agree that it does not make sense to compare the raw numerators . 
^ What I was wondering about was whether it would make much sense to threshold on the posterior probabilities when the posterior probabilities are unreliable because of violated independence assumptions . 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Indeed one should not do that , as numerators are n't comparable across examples . 
^ The right thing to do is to threshold on the posterior probability ( as &NAME said ) , or equivalently , manipulate the prior ( as &NAME &NAME said ) .

^ All , 
^ As academics , we would like to leave the data entirely uncorrupted , so we 'd rather not anonymise - but then ethical issues mean , for some purposes , we have to . 
^ Exactly the same applies to ' bad ' ( taboo , as &NAME marks it ) language . 
^ I have datasets I 'd like to give easy access to , for language learners . 
^ Do I want children / &NAME people accessing my website / CD-ROM to encounter taboo language ? 
^ Will I be exposed to lawsuits from shocked parents if I do ? 
^ Like anonymisation , it 's hard . 
^ Throwing out sentences / texts with taboo words or strings is at least straightforward - you can find them without exhaustive reading . 
^ But , as with anonymisation where there are no explicit names , there are taboo texts without taboo words , so if you want to be confident you are not disseminating taboo language , if you 're sources aim to cover the breadth of language use , an awful lot of reading is required . 
^ I recently had a conversation with a dictionary publisher facing the same predicament : yes , he did an awful lot of reading .

^ Dear All , 
^ I was interested to read in the recent posting to the list by &NAME &NAME ( see below ) that he was uncertain as to whether he should make his corpus publicly available because it contained some ' uncensored words ' ( &NAME 's point &NUM ) . 
^ I guess that this means ' bad language ' ( I assume it does not relate to anonymization issues as they are covered in &NAME 's point &NUM ).If this is about ' bleeping out ' words in corpora , should n't we encourage &NAME not to do this ? 
^ Surely we want corpora to contain uncensored speech ?

^ Dear all , 
^ I got several responses asking if I am planning to make my question list public . 
^ I think I should answer this question to the whole list . 
^ I am willing to make it public but I am not sure if I should do it right now . 
^ Here are the reasons : 
^ &NUM Some questions ask information about specific people , not only celebrities , but also probably the questioners or other people with very close relationships to the questioners . 
^ This may raise some privacy issues . 
^ I prefer to take off these questions before make the question corpus public . 
^ &NUM Some questions , actually not a small number , contain some uncensored words . 
^ I think these questions are improper to be in a corpus . 
^ &NUM Many questions are not grammatically correct or with some spell errors . 
^ I personally think this is ok becaues the questions are from real world . 
^ I do n't know what other researchers think about this . 
^ &NUM Different researchers may have different expections . 
^ For example , the original poster of this thread required why- and how- questions , other people have asked about statistic information on specific phrase groups . 
^ I would like to know if there are some common requirements from most or many researchers . 
^ &NUM After I do something to the question archive and make it public , I am thinking of updating the public question corpus time to time . 
^ More efforts have to take and I am not sure if I have enough energy to do this . 
^ I hope some &NUM is willing to join me . 
^ I am waiting for your inputs . 
^ Especially if you are willing to do something for building the corpus , I am happy to work with you .

^ Call for Papers : 
^ Journal of &NAME &NAME 
^ Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION 
^ &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL 
^ The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . 
^ It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . 
^ The importance of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950's and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . 
^ The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . 
^ This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . 
^ This special issue of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in April &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . 
^ Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : 
^ * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . 
^ Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? 
^ How should they be combined ? 
^ Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? 
^ Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? 
^ * Evaluation of &NAME systems . 
^ Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? 
^ Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? 
^ Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? 
^ Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? 
^ * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . 
^ How do these affect &NAME ? 
^ How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? 
^ Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? 
^ What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? 
^ * The effect of &NAME on applications . 
^ To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? 
^ What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? 
^ What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? 
^ * Minimising the need for handtagged data . 
^ &NAME text is expensive and difficult to obtain while untagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . 
^ What techniques can be used to make use of untagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? 
^ What use can be made of parallel text ? 
^ Can untagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ? 
^ Important Dates 
^ Submission &NUM October &NUM Notification of acceptance &NUM November &NUM &NAME copy due &NUM December &NUM 
^ Submission Information 
^ All submissions will be subject to the normal peer review process for this journal . 
^ Submissions in electronic form ( &NAME ) are strongly preferred and must conform to the &NAME specifications , which are available at :

^ The website cited March &NUM as the deadline , but the notice on the &ORG-list was dated March &NUM , and seemed to still be soliciting applications . 
^ Are you still accepting applications , and are these studentships open to applicants from outside the &NAME / EU ( specifically , the &NAME ... ) ?

^ Re the second mail I sent you - just interpolating the log probs - I vaguely remember that the log scale represents the amount of bits required for information to be transferred - in addition to the property that it scales nicely . 
^ So if you are working on this domain you have a good argument to be interpolating directly in that space ( logs ) .

^ OK , the problem is this : 
^ I 've already got log ( &CHAR ( &CHAR ) ) and log ( &CHAR ( &CHAR ) ) , because I 'm calculating probabilities in log space to avoid underflow . 
^ Thus , I have to find the equivalent of interpolating in the normal probability space . 
^ &NAME is that normal interpolation requires addition which does n't have an equivalent in the log space . 
^ Thus , the only thing I can think of is to scale and convert back to normal probs , but this still might cause problems with under / overflow if the probabilities are markedly different . 
^ Any further ideas , I 'd be grateful .

^ Dear &NAME list I have no personal stake whatsoever in the boycott of &NAME academic institutions and indeed have recently served as a referee for a research proposal with links to &NAME . 
^ Like many other contributors to this debate , I am not myself convinced that action against individals with connections to &NAME is right or even effective . 
^ However , I support the letter written by Professor &NAME and others to the &NAME questioning the appropriateness of the action taken against Professor &NAME &NAME . 
^ For anyone who might not have seen the &NAME webpage statement , I have cut and pasted it below . 
^ The homepage asserts that her ' decision was wrong ' . 
^ According to how I understood it , the letter sent to the &NAME by Professor &NAME and others expressed concern that she may have already been in some sense condemned before the inquiry conducted by &NAME is concluded . 
^ Their lack of engagement with the boycott issue per se was , I thought , rather clear : I was n't surprised to discover subsequently that some though not all of them were in fact signatories of a petition * opposing * an academic boycott of &NAME . 
^ I would like to thank those past presidents for their courageous action in support of a fellow academic . 
^ In my view they were simply upholding a basic principle of fair treatment within a &NAME HE institution to which I would hope we would all subscribe . 
^ My genuine apologies if I have offended anyone who finds this matter of how &NAME &NAME has been treated inseparable from their own political convictions . 
^ I just wanted to offer a personal statement of how this &NAME member at least felt about the letter to the &NAME , since the issue of what members thought has been raised by Professor &NAME . 
^ Best regards &NAME &NAME

^ You are here : &NAME ) &NAME ) &NAME position on &NAME boycott &NAME position on &NAME boycott &NAME has made its position opposing the boycott of &NAME academics very clear in the following &NUM statements , issued in July &NUM . 
^ First statement &CHAR &NAME academic serves on the Board of the Journal of Translational Studies . 
^ But the Journal is not a &NAME publication nor is it run by an organisation based at &NAME . 
^ The Journal is entirely separate and independent . 
^ The decision taken by the Journal on this particular matter does not reflect &NAME policy in any way . 
^ &NAME regrets the action taken to remove &NUM &NAME academics from the Board . 
^ &NAME is a multi-cultural and multi-national community that believes strongly that discrimination based on nationality , race , religion or other grounds is wrong . 
^ &NAME statement &NAME is holding an inquiry into the issues arising from Professor &NAME 's decision to remove &NUM &NAME academics from the Boards of her independently owned journals . 
^ &NAME has always had a clear position on this issue : we strongly believe that discrimination is unacceptable , that the &NAME academics should not have been removed and that this decision was wrong . 
^ If the academics had been working on &NAME journals , rather than independent and privately owned journals , they would never have been removed . 
^ However , they are not &NAME journals and do not carry the &NAME logo . 
^ &NAME appreciates the controversy and great upset that this issue has caused to many people , including our own students and staff . 
^ &NAME is holding an internal inquiry into this matter which will cover all relevant issues . 
^ The inquiry will be wide-ranging , dealing thoroughly and sensitively with all the issues that have arisen as a result of this case . 
^ The inquiry will be conducted according to &NAME 's procedures and will determine any further necessary action .

^ &NAME &NAME on Corpus-Based Approaches to Figurative Language 
^ Thursday 27th March &NUM ( all day ) &WEBSITE 
^ as part of 
^ CORPUS LINGUISTICS &NUM 
^ main programme 28th March - 1st April &NUM &NAME University , &NAME &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME 
^ Figurative language is pervasive in all kinds of discourse and as a phenomenon has attracted considerable interest from a wide variety of fields including linguistics , psychology , artificial intelligence and philosophy . 
^ However , the majority of work has been guided by linguistic intuition and not analysis of real usage . 
^ We intend this workshop to address this by focussing on the use of corpora to investigate figurative language . 
^ The following areas are of particular interest : 
^ * corpus-based studies of figurative aspects of any language 
^ * corpus-based studies of polysemy and context-sensitive meaning , in their relation to figurative language 
^ * multilingual or cross-lingual studies of figurative language 
^ * computational models of figurative language interpretation or generation , using results from corpora for guidance or being substantially evaluated on corpora 
^ * psychological models of figurative language processing , using results from corpora as a significant contribution 
^ * relationships between processing models and corpus studies 
^ A second intention of the workshop will be to explore the methodological issues of using corpora to study figurative language . 
^ Issues include : 
^ * illumination of the concepts of literalness , metaphor , metonymy etc. through corpus studies 
^ * interannotator agreement on what constitutes figurative language , metaphor , metonymy etc. 
^ * specific linguistic cues for figurative language , including studies of their frequencies and reliability and evaluation of their amenability to automated detection 
^ * corpus design and corpus analysis tools for figurative language studies 
^ * effects of domain , genre or corpus type on studies of figurative language ( including cross-corpus studies ) 
^ The workshop is intended to be a follow-up to our previous workshop at Corpus Linguistics &NUM . 
^ The previous workshop was well attended , with &NUM presented papers , &NUM discussion sessions and about &NUM participants . 
^ Selected papers will also appear in an issue of Metaphor and Symbol journal . 
^ The time for a second workshop is appropriate since in the last &NUM years there has been a great deal of interest and new research in this area . 
^ We intend the workshop to fill a full day with &NUM - &NUM presented papers . 
^ A proceedings of full papers will be generated from the workshop and we will also explore the possibility of publishing selected papers in a relevant journal . 
^ Submissions 
^ Anybody wishing to present at the workshop should submit a two-page abstract . 
^ If accepted , authors will be invited to submit a full paper ( maximum &NUM pages ) prior to the workshop which will be included in the workshop proceedings . 
^ &NAME &NAME 
^ Abstract submission deadline : Friday 21st &NAME &NUM Notification of acceptance or Friday 28th &NAME rejection : &NUM Deadline for receipt of full papers for inclusion in workshop Sunday 23rd March proceedings : &NUM

^ Building and Using Parallel Texts : Data &NAME &NAME Translation and Beyond 
^ An &ORG &NUM &NAME &NAME , &NAME May &NUM , &NUM 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers working on problems related to the creation and use of parallel text . 
^ Recent events have demonstrated once again the importance of inter-language communication , and reinforce the need for advances in machine translation ( MT ) and multi-lingual processing tools . 
^ The workshop will be centered around the problem of building and using parallel corpora , which are vital resources for efficiently deriving multi-lingual text processing tools . 
^ In addition to regular papers , the workshop also includes a shared task that will result in a comparative evaluation of word alignment techniques . 
^ We invite submissions of papers addressing any of the following issues : 
^ - Construction of parallel corpora , including the automatic identification and harvesting of parallel corpora from the Web . 
^ - Methods to evaluate the quality of parallel corpora and word alignments 
^ - Tools for processing parallel corpora , including automatic sentence alignment , word alignment , phrase alignment , detection of omissions and gaps in translations , and others 
^ - Using parallel corpora for data driven &NAME Translation 
^ - Using parallel corpora for the derivation of language processing tools in new languages 
^ - Using parallel corpora for automatic corpora &NAME 
^ - Language learning applied to parallel corpora 
^ - Translation memory systems as a source of aligned corpora 
^ While we invite submissions addressing any of the above topics , or related issues , we particularly welcome work involving parallel corpora addressing languages with scarce resources . 
^ We expect to make arrangements with a journal in Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics for a special issue that will include selected papers from this workshop . 
^ Invited Speaker : 
^ &NAME &NAME , University of Montreal 
^ Shared &NAME : 
^ All researchers who have a word alignment system available are invited to participate in the shared task , individually or as part of a team . 
^ Participants in the shared task will be provided with common sets of training data , consisting of Romanian-English and French-English parallel texts . 
^ Participants will be given approximately &NUM month to train their systems with this data , and then previously held out test data will be released . 
^ Participants will run their alignment system on this test data and submit their results , which will be evaluated using a common set of metrics . 
^ See the workshop website for details regarding the shared task . 
^ Submission format : 
^ Submissions should consist of regular full papers of max . 
^ &NUM pages , formatted following the &NAME &NUM guidelines . 
^ In addition , teams participating in the word alignment shared task are invited to submit short papers ( max . 
^ &NUM pages ) describing their systems and / or evaluation methodology . 
^ Send your submission ( a ps or pdf file ) , prepared for anonymous review , to both : 
^ &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL and &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME , &NAME , &EMAIL 
^ Important dates :

</TEXT_NORMAL>

^ Hi , 
^ thanks a lot for looking at the data . 
^ &NUM Sorry for misleading you about tokenisation --- we did leave upper cases in when we parsed ; what we sent you was a file produced afterwards that included samplenumbers ( so that the examples can be tracked ) and was lower cased ( after parsing ) and which we used for extraction of the roles , but the sentences submitted to the parser had the upper case preserved . 
^ I realise now that this was the wrong thing to do and that I forgot to mention this 
^ - -- however , the mistakes that you attributed to tokenisation are now all tagging mistakes , so that your tagging comments now probably hold for these examples . 
^ Thus e.g. , the &NAME islands case has the followign tokenisation and then the tagger ( for whatever reason ) removes the upper case for Islands . 
^ ( ABSTRACT id' 69' ) ( SENTENCE) ( W)The ( &NUM ) ( W)Solomon ( &NUM ( W)Islands ( &NUM ) ( W)is ( &NUM ( W)a ( &NUM ( W)new ( &NUM ( W)nation-state ( &NUM ( W)which ( &NUM ( W)may ( &NUM ( W)have ( &NUM ) ( &NUM ( &NUM ( W)created ( &NUM ( W)through ( &NUM ( W)the ( &NUM ( W)imposition ( &NUM ( W)of ( &NUM ( W)an ( &NUM ( W)arbitrary ( &NUM ) ( W)boundary ( &NUM ( W), ( &NUM ( W)but ( &NUM ( W)has ( &NUM ( W)to ( &NUM ) ( W)exist ( &NUM ( W)as ( &NUM ( W)a ( &NUM ( W)viable ( &NUM ) ( W)institution ( &NUM ( W)within ( &NUM ( W)the ( &NUM ( W)modern ( &NUM ( W)world ( &NUM ( &CHAR ). ( &NUM ( &NUM ( /ABSTRACT ) 
^ Tagger output and parser input : 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME nation-state_NN1 &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , _ , &NAME &NAME to_TO &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ We also see islands as the head --- thus , if islands would have been parsed as subject we are happy and see the whole country name as a subject role and the parse as correct . 
^ Instead of multi-word tokenisation we have such a mapping in the role extraction module so we are ok on that . 
^ The same holds for the other tokenisation cases that now are all tagging problems ( e.g. , the &NAME &NAME example --- normally the tagger gets this right as a proper name , byut in &NUM case it did n't) . 
^ &NUM Thanks for the comments about the parse timeout and the tagging thresholding --- it looks as if this might solve a lot of our cases . 
^ &NAME weighting might be sensible , too , as we do mostly care about precision , not recall . 
^ In cases where grammatical functions are missed we can default to literal baselines which is a very good baseline --- instead , if precision is low we overgenerate metonymies . 
^ &NUM &NAME precision and recall for subjects and objects were ( only talked about precision at talk as this is more important to us at the moment ) : 
^ &NAME : &CHAR &NUM , recall &NUM % ( thus F-measure over &NUM as you said ) 
^ &NAME : precision &NUM , recall &NUM &NAME are rounded . 
^ Note that the datasets are very small ( &NUM subjects and &NUM objects in our dataset as most country names are pps . )

^ &NAME : : &NAME - a new &NAME package for n-gram analysis , is made available at the site : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ and it will be soon be indexed by &NAME ( &WEBSITE 
^ It is a small and flexible piece of code that comes with a script ngrams.pl for direct processing of files . 
^ I am aware that this is yet another ' n-gram package , but it is novel in some ways . 
^ References to other packages are included . 
^ The man pages for the script and the module are included below . 
^ &NAME 
^ &NAME ngram [ --version ] [ --help ] [ --n3D3 ] [ --type3Dcharacter ] [ --order byfrequency ] [ input files ] 
^ DESCRIPTION This script produces n-grams tables of the input files to the standard ouput . 
^ &NAME : 3Dover &NUM 3Ditem --version 
^ &NAME version . 
^ --help Prints help . 
^ --n3DNUMBER N-gram size , produces 3-grams by default . 
^ --type3Dcharacter|byte|word Type of n-grams produces . 
^ See &NAME : : &NAME module . 
^ --orderbyfrequency By default , the n-grams are ordered lexicographi&pound; &CHAR cally . 
^ If this option is specified , then they are ordered by frequency in descending order . 
^ PREREQUISITES &NAME : : &NAME , &NAME : : &NAME 
^ SCRIPT CATEGORIES &NAME : : &NAME 
^ &NAME ALSO &NAME : : &NAME module . 
^ &NAME &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME &WEBSITE

^ NAME Text : : &NAME - &NAME &NAME analysis ( for characters , words , and more ) 
^ SYNOPSIS For default character n-gram analysis of string : 
^ use &NAME : : &NAME ; my $ ng3 &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ; ng3-)process_text ( ' abcdefg1235678hijklmnop ' ) ; print ng3-)to_string ; 
^ One can also feed tokens manually : 
^ use &NAME : : &NAME ; my $ ng3 &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( ' &CHAR ' ) ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( ' &CHAR ' ) ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( ' &CHAR ' ) ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( 'd' ) ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( ' &CHAR ' ) ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( ' &CHAR ' ) ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( ' &CHAR ' ) ; $ ng3-)feed_tokens ( ' &CHAR ' ) ; 
^ We can choose n-grams of various sizes , e.g. : 
^ my $ ng &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ( windowsize &NUM ) &NUM ) ; 
^ or different types of n-grams , e.g. : 
^ my $ ng &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ( type &NUM ) byte ) ; my $ ng &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ( type &NUM ) word ) ; 
^ DESCRIPTION This module implement text n-gram analysis , supporting several types of analysis , including character and word  ngrams . 
^ The module Text : : &NAME is very flexible . 
^ For example , it allows a user to manually feed a sequence of any tokens . 
^ It handles several types of tokens ( character , word ) , and also allows a lot of flexibility in automatic recognition and feed of tokens and the way they are combined in an &CHAR &NAME . 
^ It counts all n-gram frequencies up to the maximal specified length . 
^ The output format is meant to be pretty much human-readable , while also loadable by the module . 
^ The module can be used from the command line through the script the ngrams.pl manpage provided with the package . 
^ OUTPUT FORMAT The output looks like this : 
^ BEGIN OUTPUT BY &NAME : : &NAME version &NUM 
^ 1-GRAMS ( total count : &SMILEY a &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM 
^ 2-GRAMS ( total count : &NUM ) ab &NUM bc &NUM cd &NUM de &NUM ef &NUM fg &NUM gh &NUM 
^ 3-GRAMS ( total count : &NUM ) abc &NUM bcd &NUM cde &NUM def &NUM efg &NUM fgh &NUM 
^ &NAME OUTPUT BY &NAME : : &NAME 
^ N-grams are encoded using encode_S ( &WEBSITE can always be recognized as &CHAR . 
^ For example , for word &CHAR grams , space is replaced by underscore ( _ ) : 
^ BEGIN OUTPUT BY &NAME : : &NAME version &NUM 
^ 1-GRAMS ( total count : &SMILEY The &NUM &NAME &NUM &NAME &NUM quick &NUM 
^ 2-GRAMS ( total count : &NUM ) &NAME &NUM brown_fox &NUM brown_quick &NUM fox_brown &NUM quick_fox &NUM 
^ &NAME OUTPUT BY &NAME : : &NAME 
^ Or , in case of byte type of processing : 
^ BEGIN OUTPUT BY &NAME : : &NAME version &NUM 
^ 1-GRAMS ( total count : &NUM ) &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM _ &NUM , &NUM . 
^ &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM ... etc 
^ 2-GRAMS ( total count : &NUM ) t_ &NUM &NAME &NUM tb &NUM nt &NUM __ &NUM _ . 
^ &NUM _b &NUM &CHAR &NUM &CHAR &NUM , &CHAR &NUM .n &NUM .. &NUM &NAME &NUM br &NUM ck &NUM &CHAR &NUM ... etc 
^ &NAME OUTPUT BY &NAME : : &NAME 
^ METHODS 
^ new ( windowsize &NUM ) POS_INTEGER , type &NUM ) charac&pound; &CHAR ter|byte|word ) 
^ my $ ng &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ; my $ ng &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ( windowsize3D)10 ) ; my $ ng &NUM &NAME : : Ngrams-)new ( type3D)' word ' ) ; and similar . 
^ Creates a new ' Text : : &NAME ' object and returns it . 
^ &NAME : 
^ windowsize n-gram size ( i.e. , &CHAR ' itself ) . 
^ &NAME is &NUM if not given . 
^ It is stored in $ object-){ windowsize } . 
^ type Specifies a predefined type of n-grams : 
^ character ( default ) &NAME character n-grams : &NAME letters , sequences of all other characters are replaced by a space , letters are turned uppercase . 
^ byte Raw character n-grams : Do n't ignore any bytes and do n't pre-process them . 
^ word &NAME word n-grams : &NUM token is a word consist&pound; &CHAR ing of letters , digits and decimal digit are replaced by ( NUMBER ) , and everything else is ignored . 
^ A space is inserted when n-grams are formed . 
^ One can also modify type , creating its own type , by fine-tuning several parameters ( they can be unde&pound; &CHAR fined ) : 
^ $ o-){ tokenseparator } - string used to be inserted between tokens in n-gram ( for characters it is empty , and for words it is a space ) . 
^ $ o-){ skiprex } - regular expression for ignoring stuff between tokens . 
^ $ o-){ tokenrex } - regular expression for recognizing a token . 
^ $ o-){ processtoken } - routine for token preprocessing . 
^ Token is given and returned in $ _ . 
^ feed_tokens ( list of tokens ) 
^ This function manually supplies tokens . 
^ process_text ( list of strings ) 
^ Process text , i.e. , break each string into tokens and feed them . 
^ process_files ( file_names or file_handle_references ) 
^ Process files , similarly to text . 
^ The files are processed line by line , so there should not be any multi-line tokens . 
^ to_string ( orderby &NUM ) frequency ) 
^ Produce string representation of the n-gram tables . 
^ If parameter ' orderyby3D)frequency ' is specified , each table is ordered by decreasing frequency . 
^ HISTORY AND RELATED WORK This code originated in my ' monkeys and rhinos ' project in &NUM , and is related to authorship attribution project . 
^ Some of the similar projects are ( &NAME can be found at my site ) : 
^ &NAME &NAME Package in &NAME , by &NAME &NAME at &NAME . 
^ This is a package that includes a script for word ngrams . 
^ &NAME : : &NAME &NAME Package by &NAME &NAME This is a similar package for character n-grams . 
^ As an XS-implementation it is supposed to be very effi&pound; &CHAR cient . 
^ &NAME script ngram.pl by &NAME &NAME This is a script for analyzing character n-grams . 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME Language &NAME &NAME , in C++ by &NAME Peng A n-gram language modeling package written in C++ . 
^ BUGS AND LIMITATIONS If a user customizes a type , it is possible that a result&pound; &CHAR ing n-gram will be ambiguous . 
^ In this way , to different n-grams may be counted as one . 
^ With predefined types of n-grams , this should not happen . 
^ For example , if a user chooses that a token can contain a space , and uses space as an n-gram separator , then a tri&pound; &CHAR &NAME like this ' &CHAR &CHAR &CHAR &CHAR ' is ambiguous .

^ Thanks for your replies . 
^ A question now , if you allow me . 
^ In a ( very ) large number of cases , I see that the tokenizer has returned words for which the lemma is ended by a backslash ( '' ) , among others when the words are in capitals in a title . 
^ Is that something that comes from the original data , or is it a meaningful indication of some linguistic feature about that word ? 
^ In other words , can I safely delete any trailing '' in lemmas ? 
^ Another question , related . 
^ In a first attempt at creating a database , I modified all lemmas to have them lowercase , so as to avoid having duplicate lemmas . 
^ However , I 've started thinking that the case information is important , for proper names and so on . 
^ &NAME , among all the cases of capital letters , there are &NUM types : meaningful cases ( proper nouns , with leading capital ; acronyms with more than &NUM capital or only capital letters ) and the meaningless &NUM ( as far as semantics is concerned ) ( Initial word in a sentence , with leading capital ; titles and other highlighted words , with only capital letters ) . 
^ When the first type is interesting to have in the &NAME , the second is not . 
^ Unfortunately it is impossible to distinguish the cases . 
^ What do you think is best then ? 
^ &NAME all information or keeping all cases as in the original data ? 
^ Thanks in advance .

^ CALL FOR WORKSHOP PAPERS 
^ &NAME &NUM Post-conference &NAME &NAME Convention Center , &NAME , &NAME July &NUM , &NUM 
^ Workshop on ' Multilingual &NAME and Question Answering - &NAME &NAME and Beyond ' 
^ &NAME Speakers : ( &NUM ) &NAME &NAME Library Information Research National Institute of Informatics ( &NAME ) &NAME ( &NUM ) &NAME &NAME Dept. of Computer Sciences &NAME of &NAME at &NAME &NAME 
^ Automatic summarization and question answering aim at producing a concise , condensed representation of the key information content in an information source for a particular user and task . 
^ Interest in automatic summarization and question answering continues to grow , motivated by the explosion of on-line information sources and advances in natural language processing and information retrieval . 
^ In fact , various forms of automatic summarization 
^ and question answering will undoubtedly be indispensable given the massive information universes that lie ahead in the 21st century . 
^ &NAME and question answering involves the extraction or generation of text snippets to fulfill some user needs . 
^ Rule-based or statistical-based summarization and &NAME systems have shown promising results in the &NAME &NAME tracks , &NAME &NAME , and &NAME &NAME ; it is , however , very difficult to find good evaluation functions or rules that work well across domains or in all questions because there are many system parameters that must be carefully tuned in order to achieve good system performance . 
^ In consequence , various machine learning ( ML ) techniques have recently been applied to summarization and &NAME systems . 
^ The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for exploring the commonality underling this diversity of problem domain and approaches . 
^ The workshop has the following goals : 
^ - to bring together communities of researchers who apply machine learning techniques to summarization and &NAME systems , - to deepen the summarization and &NAME community 's understanding of the state of the art in machine learning , - to identify summarization and QA-related problems for which &NAME techniques might be appropriate , and - to advance the state of the art of summarization and &NAME technologies . 
^ Topics appropriate to this workshop include : 
^ - summarization or &NAME systems with &NAME techniques , - novel or improved &NAME techniques for summarization or &NAME , - effective feature extraction methods for characterizing summarization or &NAME , - metrics and benchmarks for evaluating the effect of machine learning techniques in summarization or &NAME systems , - generation for summarization or &NAME , - cross-language or multilingual &NAME , - integration with Web and &NAME access , - corpora creation for summarization or &NAME , - interfaces and tools for summarization or &NAME . 
^ ( ( FORMAT FOR SUBMISSIONS ) ) Submissions are limited to original , unpublished work . 
^ Submissions must &WEBSITE ( both available from the here workshop web page ) . 
^ Paper submissions should consist of a full paper ( &NUM words or less , exclusive of title page and references ) . 
^ Papers outside the specified length are subject to be rejected without review . 
^ The paper should be written in English . 
^ ( ( SUBMISSION QUESTIONS ) ) Please send submission questions to &NAME &NAME ( &EMAIL ) .

^ Dr &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME 
^ &NAME : 
^ We describe an evolution-based method for evaluating auction mechanisms , and apply it to a space of mechanisms including the standard first- and second-price sealed bid auctions . 
^ We replicate results known already in the Auction Theory literature regarding the suitability of different mechanisms for different bidder environments , and extend the literature by establishing the superiority of novel mechanisms over standard mechanisms , for commonly occurring scenarios . 
^ Thus we simultaneously extend &NAME Theory , and provide a systematic method for further such extensions .

^ Dear colleagues , I do not know the history of corporate involvement by the &NAME in public issues of language use and language politics further back than &NUM . 
^ However I agree with &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME in regretting the public position taken by ( some of ) the past presidents of &NAME on the matter of &NAME 's boycott - or rather , in regretting the manner of taking it . 
^ I do n't think it matters that my dues are not currently paid up , as it is clearly the general intention of the &NAME to represent &NAME in &NAME . 
^ I would be very surprised if members of the mass media did not take the letter in question as &NAME facto representing majority opinion in the linguistics community , no matter how carefully the authors qualify their ( undoubtedly honourable ) intentions , since such qualifications are exactly the sort of thing that gets overlooked by non-academics in general and the media in particular . 
^ In that respect I very much appreciated April &NAME 's stance in refusing to endorse the letter without formal support from the membership . 
^ It 's not clear to me from reading the past presidents ' letter why they felt it necessary to go forward without securing such support ( or perhaps discovering its absence ) . 
^ The &NAME affair has been reported for some months now , and the letter does not appear to highlight any radically new or time-sensitive developments . 
^ ( It 's also not clear to me what committee April 's letter refers to -- some of this may be down to my ignorance of developments at the last meeting . ) 
^ I am however familiar with the participation of the Linguistic Society of &NAME in matters of public interest concerning language over the last &NUM years . 
^ While the &NAME has not always been effective or unproblematic in its approach , it has generally sought member approval in an organised fashion for statements and resolutions -- sometimes , as in the &NAME case , within a few weeks after significant events occurred . 
^ More importantly , in recent years it has voiced corporate opinion primarily on issues in which &NAME are significantly united , and which fall under our professional remit , such as the harmful misconceptions underlying the English-Only movement ( &NUM ) , the protection of basic language rights ( &NUM ) , the systematicity of African American English and the pedagogical soundness of the &NAME school system 's approach in the Ebonics controversy ( &NUM ) , the academic effectiveness of bilingual education ( &NUM ) , and the adequacy of signed languages ( &NUM ) . 
^ See webpage at ( &WEBSITE these cases , the burden for summarising research and drafting a statement for presentation to the membership has indeed fallen on &NUM individual , as in the contrasting case &NAME describes , but it is then handled through the Committee on Social and Political Concerns in a regular way . 
^ Perhaps some such more elaborated structure might be useful for &NAME , in view of the concerns that members have voiced . 
^ The issues of academic freedom raised in the past presidents ' letter are indeed important &NUM for all academics , but I cannot see that there is anything linguistic about them -- other than the content of the journal in question , which has not surfaced as an issue in any of the reports I have seen . 
^ It thus seems fair to clarify why &NAME should collectively address this issue ( and similar &NUM which may arise in future ) , and how this can best be done . 
^ Sincerely , 
^ &NAME &CHAR &NAME Dept of Language and &NAME University of &NAME &EMAIL

^ ... the nightmare continues ...

^ Do n't know whether you know this stuff already &NAME , but if you do n't it might save you some time : 
^ The tagger exclusion list : 
^ - must use the ' &CHAR ' flag after &CHAR and before &CHAR / &CHAR ( I think ) when invoking 
^ - exclusion list MUST be in the same format as the lexicon , i.e : &NAME &NAME &CHAR tag &CHAR 
^ where &CHAR is the number of words in the exclusion list 
^ This is of course rather silly because the tags are totally redundant as far as I can see . 
^ - the excluded words ARE NOT output along with the other tags , rather just the ' _ ' symbol is output ( making the whole thing somewhat pointless for my purposes ! ) 
^ Anything you know about this that I do n't - I 'm all ears ...

^ Hi , 
^ I 've been trying to find a satisfactory way of doing the following for a few weeks , but have not been able to come up with an answer . 
^ If you can help I would be very grateful . 
^ I have a shell script containing the following lines : 
^ # !/bin / csh 
^ if ( $ # argv ! 
^ &NUM ) then &NAME ' Usage : scr ( dirs_file ) ( file extension to apply to ( i.e. man ) ) ' exit &NUM endif 
^ set ext $ &NUM set dirs cat $ &NUM | perl &CHAR &CHAR 's/ ( &CHAR * . $ ext / &CHAR ' 
^ where the $ &NUM and $ ext are script variables . 
^ The problem is of course that $ ext gets interpretted as a perl variable , ( I assume because it is within single quotes and therefore untouched by the shell script interpretter ) . 
^ I want a method of forcing $ ext to be expanded by the shell before it gets passed to perl . 
^ Regards , 
^ &NAME

^ Hi everybody 
^ Nearly &NUM weeks ago I posted the following query to this list : 
^ For a current project involving collocations , a colleague and I need to compute several hundreds of F-E tests , some of which involve very high marginal totals even though the cooccurrence frequencies are very small . 
^ The question now is , do you happen to know of any ( &NAME / &NAME / &NAME ) software that can cope with the enormous sizes of the resulting figures ? 
^ An example : &NUM &NUM &NUM &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM &NUM , &NUM , &NUM 
^ Some scripts on the web seemed to do the job , but on second looks , the results seemd wrong because transforming tables along the main diagonal ) with such high figures lead to different results , inviting the inference that the scripts only computed approximations ... Any idea ( &CHAR ) ? 
^ I thank the following people for their advice : &NAME &NAME , who suggested programming the test in &NAME or MAPLE ; &NAME &NAME &NAME , who directed me to versions of &NAME ( like Allegro common lisp , I believe , but NOT the lisp used to implement the &NAME editor ) which can handle integers with large ( infinite ? ) numbers of digits ; &NAME &NAME , who proposed the Scheme programming language ( see &WEBSITE &NAME ( &EMAIL ) , who suggested to use &NAME . 
^ In the meantime , I have also myself also come across &CHAR ( see &WEBSITE and also seems capable of handling the extremely large numbers mentioned above . 
^ My thanks to all who contributed and best wishes for a happy new year

^ Hi &NAME - Embarrassingly for someone who works in text classification , I 'm finding myself losing the battle against spam . 
^ &WEBSITE , which has &NAME installed , and that works great . 
^ I have it set up to insert a tag in my subject line , and have an &ORG rule that sorts all mail with that tag into a folder . 
^ I scan through the subject lines in that folder at erratic intervals and rescue any false positives . 
^ Unfortunately , most of my mail comes through &NAME &NAME . 
^ &NAME provides Brightmail as their option for spam filtering , but does not have an option to insert a tag in the subject line . 
^ Instead your only option is to have mail moved to a folder on &NAME 's server , from which it is deleted at shorter intervals than I would remember to check in on it . 
^ So I 'm not willing to use that option . 
^ I 've written Outlook &NAME rules which capture some spam , but find it tedious to keep them up to date . 
^ So I 've started to research client-based anti-spam products , and thought it would be fun to hear what folks on this list are using .

^ On Tuesday 1st April &NAME &NAME will be talking at &NAME on his work &NAME &CHAR &NAME for Life Drawing ... 
^ ' Most work with art-producing computers has focussed on ' imaginative ' images , often underwritten by data about the appearance of things in the real world . 
^ I am concerned here with considering objective drawing , exemplified by life drawing , in which the physical subject is explicit and problems revolve around the making of marks to stand for that subject . 
^ As a basis for consideration of such issues I 'll describe early work on &NAME , a paper model of a computer-based machine for life drawing . 
^ &NAME derives data from the scene before her and makes goal-directed marks to represent what is seen . 
^ &NAME effectively serves as a test-bed for understanding of the processes at work in human drawing . 
^ Also implicit in such a project are ubiquitous questions about computer creativity and machine aesthetics . 
^ As the project is at a formative stage I will be particularly interested in feedback from the &NAME members . ' 
^ More information about &NAME &NAME can be found at &WEBSITE

^ Dear &NAME , &NAME , & &NAME , ( locals in &NAME ) 
^ Friday December &NUM , you are expected for the festivities surrounding the promotion of &NAME . 
^ I 'll give you a short overview of the day : 
^ For location of campus and buildings : &WEBSITE 
^ &NUM &NUM we are all expected at the ' &NAME ' of the University : ( Building &CHAR near the ' &NAME ' , entrance building &CHAR , the tallest building on campus ) . 
^ We will have some time then to decide on the order of the questions , compare questions , and change ( for the professors ) into gowns . 
^ ( By the way , you may want to hint about your questions to &NAME directly , this is rather common but not obligatory ) . 
^ Given that there is n't a lot of time I would propose to meet there a bit earlier ( e.g. between &NUM and &NUM ) . 
^ &NUM &NUM sharp , the ceremony starts ( everybody will have some time for questions ) . 
^ &NUM &NUM sharp question time is over , and the committee retreats to decide whether &NAME has done a good job and sign the diploma . 
^ Then we return , announce the degree , there is a short ' laudatio ' and then a reception outside the &NAME . 
^ Perhaps we could have lunch together afterwards ? 
^ &NAME has a list of hotels you could use to book a room if you are coming the day before ( &NAME already booked , and I assume &NAME will too ? ) . 
^ I have to be in &NAME the 12th , so wo n't be in &NAME until the day of the promotion , but I am available on Friday afternoon and evening if anyone is still around . 
^ &NAME and / or &NAME may be available Thursday evening as well . 
^ Let me or &NAME know if you need assistance in arranging things . 
^ For the international committee members : your travel and hotel costs will be refunded after the visit . 
^ Looking forward to seeing you on the 13th ! 
^ Best , 
^ - - &NAME

^ MEAD &NAME released 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ &NAME is a multi-document summarization system with multi-lingual capabilities . 
^ The &NAME system implements extractive summarization , whereby summaries are produced by selecting a subset of highly relevant sentences from the cluster 's overall set of sentences . 
^ &NAME can summarize clusters of English documents on most POSIX-conforming operating systems and can summarize clusters of &NAME Chinese documents on a subset of these operating systems . 
^ The &NAME system has been under development since &NUM . 
^ Versions &NUM and &NUM were developed at the University of &NAME . 
^ Version &NUM was developed at a six-week workshop at the &NAME &NAME University . 
^ Versions &NUM through &NUM were incremental improvements by the &NAME workshop team members . 
^ With version &NUM , development of &NAME has moved back to the University of &NAME . 
^ MEAD &NUM represents a major refactoring of previous &NAME versions . 
^ The current version supports all the functionality of previous versions , but also has many new features . 
^ Some of these are : 
^ - Version &NUM is much more configurable than previous versions of &NAME . 
^ It allows for both system-wide and user-specific configuration files . 
^ - It has a simplified user interface . 
^ Previous versions required the user to manually edit a mead.config file and use a combination of &NAME shell commands to produce summaries . 
^ While the current version still supports this interface , MEAD &NUM has a single script interface that essentially eliminates the need for manual editing of mead.config files . 
^ - &NAME &NAME , a previously free-standing tool for evaluating summarizers , has been incorporated with the current version of &NAME . 
^ This allows users to evaluate existing summaizers , as well as evaluate the performance of the base MEAD system and any user modifications . 
^ MEAD &NAME supports co-selection ( percent agreement , precision , recall , &NAME ) and content-based evaluation metrics ( such as word overlap and longest common subsequence ) , as well as relative utility . 
^ - &NAME uses an extensive collection of custom &NAME modules that may be suitable for use in many natural language applications , including for example , question answering . 
^ - &NAME and lead-based summarizers have been incorporated into the &NAME framework . 
^ These summarizers provide useful examples of how to create new &NAME modules . 
^ - The documentation for the current version has been expanded , and now includes a significant number of example use cases and tutorials for customizing each of &NAME 's modules . 
^ To download &NAME , including documentation , and view online docs , visit : &WEBSITE

^ Dear All , 
^ I was interested to read in the recent posting to the list by &NAME &NAME ( see below ) that he was uncertain as to whether he should make his corpus publicly available because it contained some ' uncensored words ' ( &NAME 's point &NUM ) . 
^ I guess that this means ' bad language ' ( I assume it does not relate to anonymization issues as they are covered in &NAME 's point &NUM ).If this is about ' bleeping out ' words in corpora , should n't we encourage &NAME not to do this ? 
^ Surely we want corpora to contain uncensored speech ? 
^ The point , for me , of using corpora is to describe / account for language as it is , rather than language as we wish it to be .

^ Dear all , 
^ I got several responses asking if I am planning to make my question list public . 
^ I think I should answer this question to the whole list . 
^ I am willing to make it public but I am not sure if I should do it right now . 
^ Here are the reasons : 
^ &NUM Some questions ask information about specific people , not only celebrities , but also probably the questioners or other people with very close relationships to the questioners . 
^ This may raise some privacy issues . 
^ I prefer to take off these questions before make the question corpus public . 
^ &NUM Some questions , actually not a small number , contain some uncensored words . 
^ I think these questions are improper to be in a corpus . 
^ &NUM Many questions are not grammatically correct or with some spell errors . 
^ I personally think this is ok becaues the questions are from real world . 
^ I do n't know what other researchers think about this . 
^ &NUM Different researchers may have different expections . 
^ For example , the original poster of this thread required why- and how- questions , other people have asked about statistic information on specific phrase groups . 
^ I would like to know if there are some common requirements from most or many researchers . 
^ &NUM After I do something to the question archive and make it public , I am thinking of updating the public question corpus time to time . 
^ More efforts have to take and I am not sure if I have enough energy to do this . 
^ I hope some &NUM is willing to join me . 
^ I am waiting for your inputs . 
^ Especially if you are willing to do something for building the corpus , I am happy to work with you . 
^ Many thanks .

^ Here 's the tentative idea I 've got - comments would be very welcome . 
^ &NAME 
^ &NUM use CIDE or &NAME as a resource - learner 's dictionaries , so some guarantee that we 'll get good words in the defns ( unlike &NAME ) 
^ &NUM concentrate on monosemous verbs . 
^ Rationale - do n't want to do &NAME , should be enough to be interesting for an expt , monosemous verbs tend to be the less frequent &NUM - hence &NUM we want to simplify . 
^ A future project could do &NAME if this works 
^ &NUM Analyse the CIDE / &NAME definitions for the target verbs to find the candidate substitutable terms . 
^ I am not sure whether this will be too difficult or not . 
^ The idea would be that if you had a definition like CIDE 's 
^ extinguish to stop ( a fire or light ) burning ' 
^ you 'd want to get something like 
^ stop ( &NAME ) burning ' 
^ it might be necessary to handle disjunctions as alternatives 
^ extirpate to remove or destroy ( something ) completely ' 
^ remove ( &NAME ) completely ' destroy ( &NAME ) completely ' 
^ My guess is that there are a reasonable number of cases where this is n't too hard especially if you wrote patterns that depended on verb class - possibly something close has been done already ? ? ? 
^ &NUM &NAME parse the input text so that the substitution could be made ( ignoring it if it there is n't a clear match ) . 
^ e.g. the rain extinguished the fire - ( &NAME extinguish fire ) etc 
^ - - ) the rain stopped the fire burning 
^ &NUM OPTIONAL : check the substitution ( or choose between substitutions ) by seeing whether the grammatical relations corresponded to things that you 'd already seen . 
^ e.g. stop the fire burning ' you 'd be looking to see whether ( &NAME stop fire ) occurred elsewhere in some large corpus ( &NAME using &NAME 's database maybe )

^ Dear &NAME &NAME , 
^ We are in the process of converting our corpus of transcribed academic speech from &NAME to &NAME , and adding additional &NAME . 
^ Can anyone point us to some standards or ( preferably ) precedents for &NAME &NAME of : 
^ &NUM ) &NAME tagging and &NUM ) pragmatic markup ( e.g. , text segments manually identified as ' narrative ' , ' disagreement ' , ' request ' , etc. ) 
^ Within the &NAME guidelines ( P4 ) , we 've found some suggestions for the &NAME tagging , ( but nothing yet for something like our pragmatic categories ) , e.g. 
^ ( s type'sentence ' ) ( &CHAR ana' at' )The ( /w ) ( &CHAR ana' nn1' )victim ( /w ) ( &CHAR ana' gen' )'s( /m ) ( &CHAR ana' nn2' )friends ( /w ) ( /s ) 
^ But somehow this seems a bit more verbose than it needs to be . 
^ Is this format standard , or are there other XML-style &NAME formats in use ? 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ &NUM ) Yes . 
^ It is standard . 
^ Why is verbosity a problem ? 
^ If you want a compact format , you might choose to define your own . 
^ But if you do that , it is a good idea to also define a systematic and information preserving automatic mapping from your compact format to a specific &NAME format and back . 
^ That way you get the benefit of &NAME 's tools for transformation and validation , as well as whatever other benefits you obtain from working with your compact format . 
^ &NUM ) You may want to look at the choices made in part-of-speech tagging the British National Corpus . 
^ &NUM thing I noticed in your format is that applying a tool like &NAME 's textonly to it would yield either 
^ Thevictim'sfriends ... 
^ or 
^ The victim 's friends 
^ with the difference arising from the choice of whether to intepret the newlines after the ( /w ) tags as part of the document or not . 
^ If you care about document layout , you may need to do something rather more complex . 
^ The &NAME has a plausible solution to this problem ( they include whitespace in the ( &CHAR ) ( &NUM ) elements , but this complicates the problem of counting words . 
^ Whether that matters to you depends , I suppose , on what kinds of document you want to represent and why .

^ &NAME , 
^ this certainly solves &NUM problem which has been troubling me , unfortunatley at the expense of creating another problem . 
^ What you propose seems to be a fitting end to the book and sounds very good . 
^ So thank you very much for that - I imagine it will be much less controversial than the suggestion &NAME and I made some time ago . 
^ Could you suggest a title ? 
^ The problem it creates of course is with the ' PAST ' section . 
^ First &NAME has never confirmed he is willing to produce the &NAME chapter . 
^ &NAME ? 
^ Secondly I too think ' Synonymy and Semantic Classification ' is an under rated work , and I believe can be read with profit by modern students , whatever its shortcomings . 
^ Further I think it underpins all the subsequent work in important ways . 
^ Therefore I feel the volume would be diminished and be less of a piece without this section . 
^ Can I suggest &NUM ways we might move this forward ( presuming you do n't have the time to do both Chapters ) : 
^ &NUM ) we ( i.e. you and I ) consider collaborating to produce a chapter along the original lines together &NUM ) we try to find someone else to provide a chapter along the originally proposed lines ( of course its going to be difficult to find someone who knows the ( narrow ) field and the &NAME background ) . 
^ What do you think ? 
^ &NAME 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ &NAME I would like to argue for moving my category in the &NAME &NAME and see if you agree . 
^ Im down to reexamine her PhD thesis ' Synonymy and Semantic Classification ' , and I did indeed volunteer for that , as think it 's an underrated work ( and indeed got her to publish it &NUM years after she wrote it in a book series I then ran ) . 
^ However , I now think that 's a bit limited and would like to offer something ( possible in your empty FUTURES section ) on the opposition running right through her work , and indeed through the fields she spanned ( &NAME and &NAME ) , on whether &NAME methods are needed in &NAME or not , or vice versa or not . 
^ As many of you know she wrote an article a couple of years ago in &NAME { arguing NO and YES , respectively ) . 
^ The answer is quite important for both fields and I 'd like to address it ( arguing PROBABLY YES , and PROBABLY NO ) while , in the course of it , touching on and reviving her thesis work , as I had originally intended . 
^ If you agree , that will leave &NAME in solitary state in the PAST section , but everything will then be minimally populated . 
^ Let me know &NAME &NAME

^ Dear &NAME , 
^ &NAME &NAME and I are writing a grant proposal on the semantics of punctuation . 
^ It 's a new area for me and I 'm not familiar with the literature . 
^ &NAME tells me that you have a huge folder of stuff on this subject . 
^ I would be grateful if you could give me some recommendations of what to read ( especially of papers and / or dissertations that I can access online ) . 
^ I know about &NAME Say 's &NAME thesis but have been unable to access it online and so I 've emailed her . 
^ I 've also downloaded all the papers from your &NUM workshop , but these papers are quite short and I was hoping for papers that give more detail ( if there are any ) . 
^ A quick check on citeseer really threw up only the stuff from your workshop . 
^ But I ca n't help thinking that there is more stuff out there , such as &NAME dissertations ... 
^ Basically , I want to avoid re-inventing the wheel , and although &NAME is up on the stuff in &NAME , he does n't know very much about what 's going on formal semantic analyses of punctuation ( if there is anything ... ) . 
^ I 've been thinking about the data a bit now and it 's * fanscinating * ! 
^ It 's all there : parantheses as presupposition triggers , weird anaphoric effects , rhetorical structure , constraints on the properties of the intended addressee etc etc. And then I have 
^ * no * idea how to deal with the semantic typing issues in something like the quotation contexts of : 
^ &NAME said ' I have a very large ' something ; I 'm too embarrassed to say what . 
^ It should be fun to work on this stuff , but I need to know what 's already been done first ! 
^ I would be grateful for any advice on what to read ... 
^ Cheers , &NAME .

^ presents 
^ ' Engineering the Evolution of Complex Agents ' 
^ speaker : 
^ Dr. &NAME &NAME Institute of Perception , Action and &NAME University of &NAME 
^ &NUM March &NUM ( Wednesday ) 
^ &NAME Theatre &NAME &NAME Campus &NUM - &NUM pm 
^ Coffee / tea and biscuits will be available . 
^ Everyone is Welcome to Attend [ Space Permitting ] 
^ &NAME : 
^ For more than half a century people have tried to engineer software evolutionary systems which are capable of ongoing innovation and the evolution of complex agents . 
^ These attempts have met with limited success . 
^ In this talk , I will briefly review some of the seminal examples of this endeavour ( including &NAME &NAME 's self-reproducing automata , &NAME 's platform of self-reproducing computer programs - &NAME , and &NAME ' evolved virtual creatures ) , and identify aspects of each system that inhibit evolvability . 
^ This will lead onto a discussion of how to design an improved evolutionary system that could overcome some of these problems and exhibit improved evolvability .

^ &NAME &NAME , 
^ I 've started analysing what &NAME gets wrong , and since it gets plenty wrong , it 's taking a while to work through it all , but here are my notes on the sort of things I 'm finding ... 
^ If you have any input on this , that 'd be great . 
^ I 'd probably find a meeting to discuss these baseline results helpful quite soon . 
^ I 'll try to come up with a clearer picture of where ( and why ) errors occur in what sort of proportions by then . 
^ Thanks ,

^ BC- ( &NAME TYPE' LOCATION' )PEARL-HARBOR ( /ENAMEX)-HNS 
^ ( &NAME TYPE' PERSON' )BC-PEARL-HARBOR-HNS ( &NUM ) 
^ &NAME interprets whole thing as &NUM word which is not in the lexcison , so best &NAME can do is say it 's all &NUM proper noun , which then gets tagged as name -- ) PERSON .

^ Harbour &NUM NNL1 &NUM Harbor &NUM NNL1 &NUM 
^ i.e. &NAME does n't recognise HARBOR as a locative noun since it treats the capitlaised word as being all lowercase .

^ &NUM example where &NAME gets the bracketing wrong . 
^ However , even if the bracketing was right , the only entry for Service in the lexicon is : 
^ Service &NUM NN1 &NUM

^ ( &NAME TYPE' PERSON' )CHARLES ( &NUM ) ( &NAME TYPE' PERSON' )J. ( &NUM ) ( &NAME TYPE' PERSON' )LEWIS ( &NUM )

^ - - ) PERSON instead of one . 
^ c. ( &NAME TYPE'DATE' )1996 ( &NUM ) 
^ c. &NUM 
^ Untagged because the tokeniser has n't split the year into its own word .

^ No lexicon entry for Newspaper inclusing as a &NAME , otherwise presumably the whole N1 would be tagged org -- ) ORGANIZATION . 
^ ( &NAME TYPE' LOCATION' &NAME ( &NUM ) &NAME ; The ( &NAME TYPE' ORGANIZATION' &NAME ( &NUM ) has denied a request that top ( &NAME TYPE' LOCATION' &NAME ( &NUM ) commanders in ( &NAME TYPE' LOCATION' )&NAME ( &NUM ) in ( &NAME TYPE'DATE' )1941 ( &NUM ) be absolved of blame for failing to be on alert for the Japanese attack on ( &NAME TYPE' LOCATION' &NAME Harbor ( &NUM ) , but the military agreed that top ( &NAME TYPE' LOCATION' &NAME ( &NUM ) officials also must share the blame . 
^ All of these are untagged since &NAME ca n't come up with a parse tree , not even a &CHAR / fragx for this sentence . 
^ ( &NAME TYPE' ORGANIZATION' &NAME ( &NUM ) 
^ Untagged since lexcison entry is : 
^ &NAME &NUM NN1 &NUM NP1 &NUM 
^ i.e. never a &NAME . 
^ Rear Admiral &NAME ( &NAME TYPE' PERSON' )E . 
^ &NAME ( &NUM ) 
^ Rear Admiral ( &NAME TYPE' PERSON' )Husband &NAME &NAME ( &NUM )

^ Why is the comma included as part of the N1 ? 
^ Also , &NAME tags it as a TIME not DATE since it recognises Dec. as a month ( so classifies it as a temporal expression ) but has n't applied its date rule : 
^ &NAME &NAME / date : N2 [ &NAME TEMP ] -- ) ( N2 [ &NAME &NAME ] ) H0 
^ Why not ? 
^ &NAME applies it here : 
^ ( |P1 / p_np-nt||On : &NAME | ( |NP / date/--- | |January : &NAME | ( |NP / num | &NAME : &NAME | ) ) ) ) 
^ which is also a &NAME followed by a NP / num ... ? 
^ ( &NAME TYPE' LOCATION' &NAME ( &NUM ) 
^ ( &NAME TYPE' PERSON' &NAME ( &NUM )

^ etc. . . 
^ so &NAME misses tagging other ( potential ) entities e.g. it would have correctly tagged Army as ORGANIZATION . 
^ But it * would * have missed tagging Navy likewise dewspite it 's being tagged &NAME .

^ ( |N1 / n1_n1-coord/- | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |Navy : &NAME ?

^ &NAME correctly identifies Admiral as a title part of a name , but then classifies the whole thing as a name -- ) PERSON rather than just the following name . 
^ This is more a reflection on my choise of mapping to &NAME classifications though ... 
^ On the other hand , &NAME definitely should n't have bracketed ' of accountability ' together with the rest of the name , and has mistagged General as an adjective , presumably because also of the incorrect bracketing . 
^ ( |NP / n1_n1-name/- | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |General : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / n_pp-of | &NAME : &NAME | ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_n1 | |of : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |accountability : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )

^ is counted as a PERSON , which &NAME also tags :

^ What I heard at the meeting I went to at &ORG a couple of months ago was that the main reason for this move is the problem with appeals on the my supervisor hated me ' grounds . 
^ &NUM of people who fail &NAME now appeal ( across the university as a whole ) and this is one of the most popular complaints . 
^ Also there 's some &NAME guidelines - I think I have a copy somewhere , and can probably find it if required . 
^ What I said to &NAME Friday at the meeting was that there were too few of us to do this and &NAME the dissertations properly - the response was something along the lines of well , see what the board decides and take it from there ' . 
^ When &NAME is on sabbatical next year , all language ' dissertations will presumably have to be marked by &NAME or me and &NUM marker from Engineering - my feeling is that we should just say we believe this could compromise marking standards and see what happens . 
^ I do n't think personally that the supervisor involvement question is the main issue , but the difficulty of marking a research-based thesis which is totally outside one 's area of expertise - I do n't feel that we should accept a situation where both markers could be largely unaware of the prior research .

^ I think the &NAME Panel will have an extended closing date for the &NAME &NAME applications - I would suggest July &NUM ( ? ) . 
^ The &ORG are fairly adamant that applications for the &NAME &NAME , however , should have been in by March &NUM simply to prevent the problems they , and Colleges , had last year in finding College places and accommodation . 
^ Colleges have asked departments to look for an overall reduction in places of some &NUM this year - not a lot of good for &NAME &NAME programs trying to expand or get off the ground . 
^ Thanks , &NAME 
^ It is up to the admissions officers to decide on whether this is a good use of the advertising budget . 
^ It probably is n't if you plan to tell respondees that it is too late to apply this year . 
^ We have n't had a hard deadline of &NUM / &NUM for the &NAME ever , and it would be a mistake to introduce one now .

^ It would be a good idea to avoid accessing this space while this is going on , so if anyone is planning on working then , or ( more likely , I assume ) has a batch job that has to run then which might be affected , please could you let me and &NAME know , so we can sort out an alternative time . 
^ If you do n't hear anything further , please just avoid running anything which has to write to this filespace ( /usr / groups / corpora , /usr / groups / mphil , etc etc ) early on Sunday morning .

^ 11's fine by me too . 
^ The anaphor-antecedent pairs are in : 
^ /homes / jp233 / anaphora / qa / scripts / results 
^ The &NAME , parsed , one-sentence-per-line file is in 
^ /homes / jp233 / anaphora / qa / scripts / file 
^ &NAME that that 's OK , if you want the stuff re-run then run.pl should do that ( although there may be permission issues ) -- email me if it does n't work .

^ Below are the &NUM context sets where pronominal anaphora resolution could , in principle , help . 
^ If you can run these through the system ( or give me a script ) , then I and &NAME can figure out how to integrate the antecedent ( &CHAR ) back into the pattern matcher so that we can assess the effect on ranking and on the ability of the system to return the right short answer from the highest matching set of &NAME 
^ Resolving anaphora in all the context sets could also affect rankings etc elsewhere so if we could figure out how to reintegrate the results with &NAME 's system it wld be good to do this . 
^ However , I do n't think it is essential we do this before submitting the abstract .

^ The &NAME University Linguistic Society will meet on Wednesday &NUM &NAME , &NUM : 
^ Professor &NAME &NAME School of Linguistics and Language University of &NAME 
^ will talk on 
^ ' &NAME and movement types ' ( abstract below ) 
^ &NAME : Wednesday &NUM &NAME , 5.00pm ( tea served from 4.30pm ) &NAME : The &NAME Library , &NAME College , &NAME Street . 
^ Following the talk , the society 's officers will take the speaker out to dinner at a local restaurant ; members of the audience are most welcome to join us . 
^ Membership of the society for &NUM remains at &NUM pounds ( &NUM pounds for students ) . 
^ If not already paid , subscriptions can be brought to the meeting . 
^ Cheques should be made payable to &NAME University Linguistic Society . 
^ AGREEMENT AND MOVEMENT TYPES 
^ The talk concerns certain conditions on agreement and movement in ( mainly ) 
^ Icelandic raising constructions . 
^ In Icelandic a seem-type raising verb takes an optional experiencer argument , assigned dative case . 
^ The dative &NAME 
^ is usually moved to subject position , in which case the seem-verb can optionally agree with the subject of the infinitival clause , as in ( &NUM ) . 
^ ( &NUM ) 
^ &NAME &NAME &CHAR [ the horses to be slow ] ( Icelandic with English words ) Or the 
^ dative &NAME can remain in &NAME if it is indefinite , as in ( &NUM ) . 
^ In that case 
^ the matrix verb and the embedded subject ca n't agree , so the verb gets default &NAME form . 
^ The intervening dative &NAME blocks agreement . 
^ ( &NUM ) There seems/ * seem ( to ) a man [ the horses to be slow ] If the dative &NAME is wh-moved , it still blocks agreement . 
^ ( &NUM ) ( To ) what man do you think that seems/ * seem &CHAR [ the horses to be slow ] ? 
^ A wh-trace blocks agreement , but an 
^ NP-trace does n't &NUM so to speak . 
^ This has various interesting implicatio ns for the theory of agreement and movement . 
^ For &NUM thing it presupposes that 
^ the wh-phrase moves directly to &NAME , without passing through &NAME , or 
^ the relevant trace &NAME be a wh-trace . 
^ It is far from obvious how this can be ensured . 
^ And why would NP-trace and wh-trace be different , to begin 
^ with ? 
^ Matters are further complicated by the fact that although the wh-trace blocks agreement , it does not block NP-movement across it .

^ Both language modeling papers I listed mentioned a simple technique for obtaining training data using a standard search engine such as &NAME i.e. you can simply specify the language of the document to be searched for .

</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ By ' Multilingual &NAME &NAME ' I mean the problem of automatically assigning a category to a document whatever it is the language . 
^ The suggested approach , build separate language models for the different languages , supposes to have a sufficient quantity of texts in each language ( and for each category ) to be able to learn a model . 
^ In the real life this is not always true . 
^ &NAME , 
^ At &NUM : &NUM &NUM / &NUM / &NUM , you wrote :

^ Hi &NAME , 
^ I need a fast way to get content on the website for my course ; I do n't mind editing my own pages , in fact I would prefer it to having to wait for you to put it up there . 
^ For my course , there are daily or weekly updates : lists of literature , recent versions of the lecture notes , additional papers from there -- my students need this stuff and ( rightfully ) bug me about it . 
^ So if you can just give us the path , and write permission , that would solve the problem for now . 
^ Thanks a lot .

^ In your &NAME paper on the &NAME website , you say that you found a way to call &NAME from within &NAME on each individual sentence , using xmlperl . 
^ I assume you set this up as a client-server architecture , so that the parser has to load the grammar only once .

^ &NUM thing that I think we ought to discuss before the projects are marked is the feedback that we give the students on the projects . 
^ at the moment we do n't tell them anything , which I assume is because the course is over and because technically we should n't tell them anything until it 's ratified by &ORG , but I do n't think this is consistent with the University policy on retention of exam results , since we actually keep the marks ourselves ( and supply mark-based information in references ) . 
^ the general University policy is that we should tell students everything that might provide useful feedback . 
^ Personally I think we should give the students letter grades , not necessarily immediately after the exam - it could wait till &ORG has OKayed them , and it could be something that was only disclosed on request . 
^ But I think this is the sort of thing that should be discussed , since I do n't want to lumber any future examiners with a choice that seems unreasonable .

^ Dear &NAME 
^ Re : &NAME / &NUM 
^ I am writing as I have noticed an error when I was compiling the &NAME Status Report . 
^ I realised that the above paper is with you for a decision following the &NUM reports we have received on the paper , but I have recently asked &NUM more people to review . 
^ I apologise for this mistake , which occured following my chase email regarding papers With Editor last week . 
^ You kindly sent a big list of referees for the papers you had on record , and I did not check whether the papers were all in fact waiting for referees . 
^ It turns out that this paper was actually with you for a decision , not referee allocation . 
^ One of the referees could not be reached anyway , as their email did not respond ( Dr &NAME ) , but the other referee , Dr &NAME &NAME &NAME , was chased for a response today . 
^ I will obviously not chase this referee again , as &NUM reports have been received , but I would be grateful to hear how you wish to proceed if the reviewer agrees to review . 
^ Should I apologise and say that no further reports are needed , or accept and wait for the review ? 
^ I look forward to hearing how you would like to deal with this matter . 
^ Many thanks ,

^ Notes to the Editor . 
^ This paper concerns the adaptation of statistical language models by using relevant text material written in another language in conjunction with statistical machine-translation techniques . 
^ The subject and content of this paper is relevant , interesting and well-presented . 
^ &NUM point I do feel should be addressed before publication is chapter &NUM ( &NAME ) . 
^ While this chapter contains interesting material , it is not central to the main body of the paper and I feel it detracts from the focus of the work . 
^ Furthermore , the content is largely speculative since no results are reported . 
^ I feel this material does not belong in the current publication and should simply be omitted . 
^ My recommendation is for the publication in &NAME of the submitted work subject to my previous comment . 
^ With best regards , &NAME &NAME .

^ Notes to the authors . 
^ The paper concerns topical work that is very interesting and well- presented . 
^ I have only &NUM points of criticism , the first of which I consider more important . 
^ &NUM Chapter &NUM , the Epilogue . 
^ This chapter concerns the introduction of the notion of a cross-lingual trigger and a discussion of how it may be incorporated into a language model using maximum-entropy techniques . 
^ This is highly interesting but not immediately relevant to the main body of the paper . 
^ I feel this section should be omitted as it obscures the focus of the work presented in the first &NUM sections , and does not include any experimental evaluation . 
^ Instead I suggest this be a topic of a separate future publication . 
^ &NUM The word ' contemporaneous ' plays a major role in your paper , not least by its appearance in the title . 
^ Since this word is as far as I am aware not in common use , I would suggest a short initial explanation to clarify the context in which you are using it .

^ It has been produced by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( &NAME ) in association with the &NAME &NAME Gardens , &NAME . 
^ The discovery of the structure of &NAME was one of the most important scientific advances of the 20th century . 
^ The double helical structure immediately suggested how &NAME could hold information and how this could be copied and passed to future generations . 
^ Plant scientists today use &NAME technology to answer questions such as ' What makes plants the shapes and colours they are ? 
^ How do they cope with pests and diseases ? 
^ How can we preserve biodiversity and use natural plant resources to find new medicines and other useful compounds ? ' &NAME in the Garden uses living plant exhibits and interactive models to answer some of these questions , and pose a lot more ... 
^ At the exhibition you will see : 
^ - Ordinary plants with extraordinary flowers : How changes in &NAME alter the shape of flowers . 
^ - Grass for all seasons : selecting the right turf for football pitches , farming , golf courses and &NUM other uses . 
^ - The classification game : the problems and pitfalls of classifying plants , and how &NAME research is helping to solve these problems . 
^ - Virtual plants : how computer models help us understand more about how plants grow . 
^ - &NAME 's peas : how a monk ' invented ' genetics - and was then forgotten ! 
^ - The wonderful weed : meet the plant that 's the workhorse of modern plant science research . 
^ For more information on visiting Kew , go to the website at &WEBSITE

^ &NAME , 
^ Does anyone out there have some experience working with corpora that have linguistic &NAME ( e.g. for part of speech , syntax , multiword expressions , or word senses ) kept in files separate from the text itself ? 
^ This is the system recommended by the CES and &NAME corpus encoding standards , and the &NAME guidelines also provide a mechanism for putting tags in &NUM document that indicate links to another document . 
^ I 'm trying to get my mind around how best to enable software to access corpus &NAME in such a format . 
^ Ideally such access could be provided using standard &NAME formats and tools , like &NAME and &NAME . 
^ Any suggestions on how best to do this , pointers to software or &NAME that work with modular &NAME , etc. would be invaluable .

^ Dear all , 
^ &NAME University is holding a &NUM day workshop to discuss the recent advances and future direction for research in computational models of human sentence processing : 
^ Those working in the field who are interested in attending the workshop should contact &NAME &NAME for further details ( &EMAIL ) and confirmation , as space is strictly limited . 
^ &NAME : Computational models of sentence processing 
^ Dates : &NUM July , &NUM &NAME : &NAME &NUM ( minus &NUM ) &NAME , &NAME University &NAME , &NAME 
^ Further details are available from the workshop website : &WEBSITE 
^ The workshop is organized by &ORG , the &ORG , and the &ORG ( &NAME ) , &NAME ; and is part of the &NAME &NUM ( Resource Adaptive Cognitive Systems ) . 
^ Workshop themes 
^ The workshop is intended to address what we view as &NUM central issues for the development of computational models of human language processing . 
^ We feel these issues represent the current stumbling blocks to constructing the next generation of models , and our aim is to hear concrete views on how to tackle these problems now and where research efforts should be directed in the medium term . 
^ &NUM Models of working memory in language processing : to what extent does human working memory influence language processing behaviour , are the mechanisms for language processing adapted to take memory constraints into account ? 
^ More generally , how should theories of sentence processing be situated within , and reconciled with , more general accounts of cognitive processing and cognitive limitations ? 
^ &NUM . 
^ Broad coverage : how can we develop psycholinguistic models that scale up in such a way that explains both high performance in general as well as the more pathological behaviours focused upon in psycholinguistic research ? 
^ What kinds of mechanisms ( statistical , constraint-based , ... ) and linguistic theories ( dependency , generative , incremental ) seem most promising for developing broad coverage models ? 
^ &NUM . 
^ Semantics in performance : how can we extend current syntactically-based accounts with implementable approximations of human semantic knowledge ( lexical , sentential , as well as plausibility ) ? 
^ Speakers : 
^ &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME Dyke &NAME Vasishth

^ Hi Dr &NAME . 
^ I 'd like to do an intensive but part-time &NAME . 
^ My specific area of interest is the commercially useful analysis of business language text . 
^ This may include for example analysis of political bias , positive / negative tone , identification of recommendations , and rating of risk . 
^ I 've backgrounded myself already , reading quite a few papers and books on sentiment classification and information extraction ( about to embark on machine learning ) . 
^ I have no experience of academic linguistics , but I have been an ' information architect ' in web systems for clients such as &NAME , &NAME and News International . 
^ I have a &NUM degree in Civil Engineering ( &NUM ) , a &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NUM years experience in strategic marketing and business information systems . 
^ I 'm currently &NUM and a director in a growing web software company . 
^ I wonder if you could give me some idea of : &CHAR ) my suitability to &NAME &CHAR ) whether I could work on a ' distance learning ' basis &CHAR ) whether the timing of my application fits with the application schedule 
^ I have attached a summary of my interests below . 
^ &NAME regards , 
^ &NAME 
^ &NAME &NAME All Out &NAME &WEBSITE 
^ email : &EMAIL 
^ &NUM &NAME Road &NAME &NAME &NAME &WEBSITE 
^ &NUM &NUM &NUM ( direct ) &NUM &NUM &NUM ( main ) 
^ &NUM RATIONALE Recent research in the areas of sentiment classification , information extraction and machine learning applied to language processing has resulted in systems which can intelligently interpret documents with respect to particular tasks . 
^ This work has achieved success rates which are scientifically significant ; indeed in some experimental applications , success rates have approached those of humans . 
^ Many researchers have created innovative techniques to harness a diverse range of text resources ( including search engines , thesauri and internet content ) . 
^ However , we are still some way off the success rates of human interpretation in the commercial field . 
^ Perhaps now is the right time to start the development of commercially satisfactory machine interpretation ( &NAME ) which can achieve near-human interpretation within the wide limits of commercial applications . 
^ Ultimately , &NAME 's success will be measured by its adoption within the market . 
^ Initially however , the commercial market needs to exert its influence on this field , and researchers need to understand commercial expectations , to examine their implications on outputs and inputs , and to develop viable trial systems . 
^ This is where I wish to focus my attention . 
^ &NUM RESEARCH INTERESTS My research interests are in the applied ( ie commercially useful ) relationship between information extraction ( ie summarising key facts ) and sentiment classification . 
^ In particular , I am concerned with defining the potential applications of this relationship within a business context and in attempting to achieve a machine-interpretation accuracy which is acceptable to the market , within a defined scope ( possibly close to human accuracy levels ) . 
^ I wish to demonstrate that a single engine should be able to both perform and relate information extraction and sentiment classification simultaneously from natural language in common business use , mainly through shallow techniques in machine learning . 
^ Furthermore , I hope to show that a typical business person should be able to operate such a system given a mixture of pre-configured and user-defined input parameters , and achieve an accuracy which is high enough to satisfy commercial expectations - perhaps over &NUM . 
^ For example , I would hope that my work will contribute towards making the following activity possible : a market analyst submits &NUM articles from the Financial &NAME on the footwear industry to an online service she enters the key topic areas of interest ( eg growth , risk , retail demand , innovation ) Online service produces 
^ - a summary of key facts and related author sentiments on these topics 
^ - a clear statement of certainty on each area 
^ &NUM PROPOSED RESEARCH I intend to conduct applied research into a modular system which contains the following components : 
^ &NUM &NUM . 
^ Sentiment selection by user &NAME the resources and processes to enable users to select sentiments , which will embrace : &CHAR ) user choice from pre-defined sentiments &CHAR ) user-defined sentiments &CHAR ) selecting multiple simultaneous sentiments 
^ &NUM &NUM . 
^ Classifier data enrichment To support advanced polling of multiple classifiers : &CHAR ) simultaneous deployment of multiple classifiers ( eg Naive , Vector Distance , &NAME , Adjective-adverb Phrase , &NAME ) &CHAR ) generation of secondary data to record the certainty of the classification &CHAR ) generation of tertiary data to enable the subsequent relating to information extraction &CHAR ) creation of variants of known classifiers to enhance their application to business language &CHAR ) possible development of thesaurus-based classifier as an addition to known classifiers &CHAR ) customisation of inputs and outputs to &NAME a typical business user 
^ &NUM &NUM . 
^ Information extraction &CHAR ) simultaneous deployment of multiple extractors ( eg Wrapper Induction , &NAME , Pattern Matching , Ontology-based Techniques ) &CHAR ) generation of secondary data to record the certainty of the extraction &CHAR ) generation of tertiary data to enable the subsequent relating to sentiment classification &CHAR ) variation of known extractors to enhance their application to business language &CHAR ) construction of common business concepts and lexicons &CHAR ) customisation of inputs and outputs to &NAME a typical business user 
^ &NUM &NUM . 
^ Enhanced polling &CHAR ) generating a commercially satisfactory correlation between result populations and polling harmony &CHAR ) exploiting the classifier certainty and extractor certainty data derived from ( &NUM ) and ( &NUM ) above &CHAR ) simultaneously delivering dependent and independent results for classifier and extractor polling 
^ &NUM &NUM . 
^ Machine-learning processes &CHAR ) to increase accuracy &CHAR ) to reduce processor workload &CHAR ) to dynamically grow a library of sentiment and information resources for greater user choice &CHAR ) to support the relating of sentiment classification to information extraction 
^ &NUM &NUM . 
^ Relating Data Relating information extraction to sentiment classification in a way which is usable to typical business users : &CHAR ) defining models for this relationship &CHAR ) offering a choice of pre-defined relationship models &CHAR ) possibly permitting user-defined models

^ CALL FOR PAPERS &NAME &NAME ( The Journal of the Pattern &NAME &NAME ) 
^ Special Issue on Grammatical Inference Techniques & Applications 
^ This Special Issue will be published in April , &NUM to commemorate and &NAME the memory of Late Professor &NAME &NAME &NAME . 
^ Grammatical Inference ( GI ) is a collection of methodologies for learning grammars from training data . 
^ The most traditional field of application of &NAME has been syntactic pattern recognition . 
^ In the recent past , however , concerted efforts from diverse disciplines to find tractable inference techniques have added new dimensions and opened up unchartered territories . 
^ Applications of &NAME in more nontraditional fields include &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME and Information Retrieval . 
^ Development of algorithms for &NAME has evolved over the years from dealing with only positive training samples to more fundamental efforts that try to circumvent the lack of negative samples .. This idea is pursued in stochastic grammars and languages which attempt to overcome absence of negative samples by gathering statistical information from available positive samples . 
^ Also within the framework of information theory , probability estimation technique for &NAME &NAME Model known as &NAME and for Context-Free language , the Inside-Outside algorithm are focal point of investigations in stochastic grammar field . 
^ Techniques that use intelligent search to infer the rules of grammar are showing considerable promise . 
^ Recently , there has been a surge of activities dealing with specialized neural network architecture and dedicated learning algorithms to approach &NAME problems . 
^ In more customary track , research in learning classes of transducers continue to arouse interests in &NAME community . 
^ Close interaction / collaboration between different disciplines and availability of powerful computers are fueling novel research efforts in &NAME . 
^ The objective of the Special Issue is to present the current status of this topic through the works of researchers in different disciplines . 
^ Original and tutorial papers are solicited that address theoretical and practical issues on this theme . 
^ Topics of interest include ( but are not limited to ) : 
^ &NAME : Neural network framework and learning algorithms geared to &NAME &NAME via heuristic and genetic search Inference mechanisms for stochastic grammars / languages Algebraic methods for identification of languages &NAME learning 
^ &NAME : Image processing and computer vision Biosequence analysis and prediction Speech and natural language processing Data mining / information retrieval Optical character recognition 
^ &NAME &NAME : Only electronic ( ftp ) submission will be accepted . 
^ Instructions for submission of papers can be found at the guest editor 's web site &WEBSITE ) . 
^ All submitted papers will be reviewed according to guidelines and standards of Pattern Recognition .

^ &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and &NAME 
^ Hi , or should I say G'day &NAME , time to loose this plummy accent . 
^ Well , we 're here in the land of the kiwi and all doing very well . 
^ The trip over here was great , little &NAME was a superstar , I think she actually quite enjoyed the trip . 
^ Finally got over the jet lag and are bedding into our new life . 
^ So far so good - much more relaxed than English life . 
^ We 've found ourselves a new home ( obviously not as nice as the one we left ) . 
^ It 's a &NUM bedroom house in the hills with views looking out over the Harbour - well , most days , bit of a stormy day today and the clouds are so low you ca n't actually see much at all . 
^ Work is going well for me - I do n't have to work half as hard as I did in &NAME ( I 'm hoping this is n't just a honey moon period thing ! ) Probably going to have a bit of a tour around the country in September when &NAME and &NAME come out , until then it 's time to batten down the hatches for winter . 
^ &NAME , hope you are all well and enjoying the garden . 
^ Speak to you soon 
^ &NAME

^ Dear &NAME , &NAME , and Friends of the &NAME , 
^ I am writing to provide you with an update of our plans for Membership Year &NUM . 
^ This year , we anticipate providing a varied collection of corpora including our first video releases and data of interest to sociolinguists . 
^ Before elaborating on these intended releases , I would like to briefly review the year thus far . 
^ We released these corpora as &NUM / &NUM publications : 
^ LDC2003T03 &NUM &NAME German Transcripts &NAME &NUM &NAME Spanish Transcripts &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME 
^ We released these corpora as &NUM publications : 
^ LDC2003T07 Arabic &NAME : Part &NUM - 10K-word English Translation &NAME Arabic &NAME : Part &NUM &CHAR &NUM &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME Bantu &NAME : Dschang Lexicon &NAME &NAME Bantu &NAME : &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME Korean Telephone Conversations &NAME &NAME Korean Telephone Conversations Transcripts 
^ Further information is available at our online catalog : 
^ &WEBSITE 
^ Our planned releases for the remainder of &NUM include the following corpora . 
^ Please note that this list is subject to change and should be used only as a general guideline : 
^ * &NUM &NAME Speaker &NAME &NAME - the &NUM data from an ongoing series of yearly evaluations conducted by &NAME towards solving text independent speaker recognition . 
^ * Arabic &NAME Part &NUM - first part of a billion word collection ; &NUM &NAME release of newswire text from &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME . 
^ * &NAME &NAME &NUM - &NAME words , &NAME sentences , &NUM data files ; material drawn from &NUM articles from &NAME newswire between &NUM and &NUM , &NUM articles from Information Services Department of HKSAR newswire in &NUM , &NUM articles from &NAME magazine , &NAME ; &NAME coded ; formatting similar to &NAME &NAME &NAME for all &NAME files ; no sgml tags for &NAME news & &NAME files . 
^ * &NAME &NAME English Parallel Corpus - &NUM sentence-aligned Chinese news texts and their English translation . 
^ * Cross-Channel Forensic Speech for Automatic Speaker &NAME - data first used in a study evaluating existing speaker recognition systems that analyze speech that was designed specifically for forensic applications ; subsequently the data was used as part of the &NUM &NAME Speaker &NAME ; &NUM audio files , totaling approximately &NUM hours of speech ; speech files are in sphere format , one-channel &NAME , with 16-bit pcm samples ; all speakers are male and each speech segment contains a single speaker . 
^ * FORM - &NAME scheme developed to capture the kinematic information of gesture from videos of speakers ; video annotated with geometric descriptions of the positions and movements of the upper and lower arms , and the hands and wrists ; FORM uses &NAME graphs as its logical representation ; first release will be a corpus of gesture- annotated videos . 
^ * SAID ( &CHAR &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ) - purpose to provide data for investigating the structural configurations in which English idioms are typically found , assuming that , since idioms are phrasal lexical items ( &NAME ) , they will therefore have structural properties which are idiosyncratic ; data set consists of over &NUM , &NUM idioms which have been hand annotated with a labeled bracketed syntactic analysis ; citation forms are drawn from &NUM major dictionaries of English idioms ; analysis was conducted at the University of &NAME , &NAME . 
^ * &NAME &NAME Corpus of &NAME American English Part &NUM - based on hundreds of recordings of natural speech from throughout the &NAME , representing a wide variety of people of different regional origins , ages , occupations , and ethnic and social backgrounds ; reflects many ways that people use language in their lives ; contains &NUM speech files and accompanying transcript files that have been annotated and time stamped ; &NUM unique speakers , over &NAME words ; material collected by the University of &NAME , &NAME &NAME Center for the Study of Discourse . 
^ * &NAME Corpus of &NAME - comprises &NUM sociolinguistic interviews with a total of &NUM speakers , conducted by &NAME &NAME and his students between &NUM and &NUM ; interviews were selected as examples of classic sociolinguistic interview methodology , and represent a range of English regional and social dialects ; in addition to the audio and corresponding transcripts , the publication includes a survey of sociolinguistic variables represented in the corpus ; also includes the DASL-Trans tool that allows users to easily access the audio and transcripts and play examples of each variable surveyed ; will be available for free download . 
^ * VidTI&ORG - comprised of video and corresponding audio recordings of &NUM volunteers ( &NUM female and &NUM male ) , reciting short sentences ; &NUM sentences per person ; can be used for research involving automatic visual- or audio-visual speech recognition or person authentication / verification ; sentences were chosen from the test section of the NTI&ORG ( LDC93S2 ) corpus . 
^ As a reminder Membership Year &NUM will remain open through December &NUM , &NUM . 
^ Year &NUM offers &NUM corpora including Switchboard-2 Phase &NUM , ACQUAINT , &NAME Point Arabic Speech , and publications in Korean , Spanish , and &NAME .

</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ &NAME ha .. well I 'm certainly not going to go through the files correcting grammar . 
</TEXT_NORMAL>
<TEXT_EMBEDDED> 

^ Certainly introducing the spurious semi-colons will seriously confuse the parser , so doing a global sub using ( &CHAR ) awk or sed before parsing wld help .

<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Version &NUM of the scorer ( used for the formal test ) appears to install &NAME , but it 's version &NUM ( for the dry run ) that 's problematic . 
^ ( I 've yet to test actually using version &NUM . 
^ though . ) 
^ Here 's the error messages I get when following the install instructions. . 
^ 2E 
^ fang : MUC_scorer3.1 $ make install cd src ; make ' &NAME .. /bin ' install /Nfs / elmer-e5 / homes-3 / ar283 / unix_home / project / muc_7 / &NAME / MUC_scorer3.1 / &NAME &NAME / src make [ &NUM ] : Entering directory /Nfs / elmer-e5 / homes-3 / ar283 / unix_home / project / muc_7 / &NAME / MUC_scorer3.1 / MU C_scorer3.1 / src ' gcc &CHAR -DSCCSID l.config.c 
^ l. config.c : &NUM : initializer element is not constant 
^ l. config.c : &NUM : initializer element is not constant make [ &NUM ] : * * * [ l.config.o ] Error &NUM make [ &NUM ] : Leaving directory /Nfs / elmer-e5 / homes-3 / ar283 / unix_home / project / muc_7 / &NAME / MUC_scorer3.1 / MU C_scorer3.1 / src ' make : * * * [ install ] Error &NUM 
^ 2E .. and &NAME &NAME 's reply to my query ... 
^ The install sequence is failing on the line gcc &CHAR -DSCCSID l.config.c 
^ ie the C compiler is producing a syntax error when it tries to compile the file l.config.c in your project / muc_7 / &NAME / MUC_scorer3.1 / MUC_scorer3.1 / src directory . 
^ specifically it is failing on line &NUM , FILE * configin &NUM stdin , * configout &NUM stdout ; 
^ because stdin ( and stdout ) is defined previously in such a way that the compiler does n't know that it is a constant , and as this line is a definition this is an error because you cannot define something to be equal to something else that is n't known at compile time . 
^ Or to summarise : with our &CHAR compiler this is an error . 
^ The writer of the software presumably has a compiler which allows this sort of construct . 
^ You 'll either have to complain to whoever wrote the software or find a &CHAR expert willing to figure out how to rewrite the file such that our compiler allows it . 
^ Thanks , 
^ &NAME

^ I have asked that the Board extend the deadline to the end of April for &NAME students to pick up on the fact that a lot of mail is being scanned slowing up delivery to the &NAME considerably ! 
^ We can therefore advertise the fact that full-time students have an extension until April 15th - that 'll allow for the incredible backlog at the &NAME and some breathing space for applications posted before April 15th to arrive . 
^ Part-timers can apply up until July 31st directly to me . 
^ Thanks , &NAME 
^ &NAME , 
^ ( &NAME - does this mean that &ORG will not accept &NAME aplications after the deadline ?

^ &NAME RESEARCH LECTURE 
^ SPEAKER : &NAME &NAME &NUM HOST : &NAME &NAME 
^ DATE : Thursday 16th January &NUM 
^ TIME : &NUM : &NUM 
^ PLACE : &NAME Theatre , &NAME Research Ltd &NUM &CHAR &CHAR &NAME Avenue ( Off &NAME Road ) &NAME 
^ TITLE : Opening up the Kernel to 3rd Parties 
^ For safety reasons , most modern operating systems allow only users with the highest privileges ( ' root users ' ) to program the kernel directly . 
^ However , there exist many application areas ( e.g. in network packet processing ) where 3rd party code would benefit from the ability to execute below the kernel boundary . 
^ In the Open Kernel Environment ( &NAME ) , we allow any party with the appropriate credentials to load fully optimised native code in a safe manner in the heart of the &NAME kernel . 
^ Depending on the credentials the code will get more or less access to resources , such as &NAME time , heap , stack , &NAME , etc. The restrictions are enforced by a trusted compiler . 
^ In other words , the &NAME offers a safe and flexible environment for programming the kernel . 
^ In this talk , I will give an overview of the &NAME , and of the mechanisms that were used to restrict the modules .

<MESSAGE_BODY>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ In several articles I have read , I found the authors using log-linear models with priors , usually a Gaussian prior , in order to perform smoothing or to eliminate the possibility of infinitely large weights . 
^ My question is thus : has anyone using priors with these models done analyses to show that the resulting posteriors remain log-linear ?

^ Hi , 
^ I have been trying to come to some sensible conclusions about which topic codes to select . 
^ Given some basic assumptions : 
^ &NUM It would be nice to have several granularities of classification available in order to investigate performance thoroughly 
^ &NUM Issues of data sparsity should be avoided if possible ( hence large training set ) 
^ &NUM Using similar data to &NAME would save time and effort 
^ &NUM Building on ( or at least comparing to ) &NAME &NAME 's work might be beneficial 
^ It seems sensible to mimic what &NAME is thinking of doing and make use of the &CHAR * and &CHAR * topic hierarchies . 
^ The &CHAR * hierarchy provides both fine and medium granularities ; the use of both &CHAR * and &CHAR * gives a coarse classification problem . 
^ There are many documents in each hierarchy , tempering any data sparsity problems . 
^ In fact , there are probably too many documents in the &CHAR * hierarchy especially , and so perhaps only a subset should be used : for example the C1 * documents and not the C2 * , C3 * etc. 
^ Does this seem sensible to you ? 
^ I have shell scripts running that retrieve the zip file and xml file name of each document belonging to each hierarchy , but they take an extremely long time to run . 
^ Also : in his write-up &NAME &NAME says that some documents are assigned a sub-topic without being assigned the corresponding parent ( e.g. C18 without &NAME ) ; it seems to me that these should be taken as implied where they are not present , but that may not be correct . 
^ Thanks , 
^ &NAME 
^ &NAME &NAME &EMAIL 
^ I 'd prefer you handed in and I signed off on something that had a sensible estimte of filespace recquirements so do this after your lab reports

^ Re : proposal 
</TEXT_NORMAL>

<MESSAGE_BODY>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ Things have been a bit hectic lately ( e.g. I stupidly promised &NAME to go and give a talk in his MEANING workshop , before I realised that they want me to give plenty of feedback on their project as well ! ) but I have managed to work on the &NAME and &NAME proposals . 
^ I think the proposals are now better , but I would be grateful if you had a quick look . 
^ I left them in your pigeon hole in an envelope . 
^ They ended up being quite similar in terms of the overall goal : 
^ They both propose developing a system for automatic large-scale / domain-specific verb classification ( building on the extant technology -- rasp parser , subcat extraction , &NAME clustering -- and improving / expanding on this where needed ) and using the final version of this system to acquire a large domain-independent classification for verbs , which will be made available for public use , along with the software which can be used to tune it specific to domains / tasks . 
^ They differ in that 
^ &NUM ) &NAME proposal involves experimenting with what kind of linguistically interesting novel information ( aside verb classes ) we can acquire from corpus data using our technology . 
^ Where possible , this information will be incorporated into the final resource I build . 
^ &NUM ) &NAME proposal is technically a bit more ambitious , it concentrates on extracting verb classes and class participants ( no other novel info ) , and involves developing a new task-based evaluation in the context of event extraction . 
^ If you feel they are not different enough , I 'll then change / modify them further . 
^ Also , I am happy to improve them further where required . 
^ &NAME does n't have any deadlines , but it would be good to submit asap so that the proposal will get to the July board . 
^ I just received &NUM successful fellowship proposals to look at , so I will also be able to submit the fellowship prop . 
^ soon . 
^ I think you mentioned I could submit the &NAME proposal to the ' Research in the Fundamental Computer Science for e-Science ' scheme ? 
^ The deadline for that is this month : &NUM . 
^ I have already asked &NAME to calculate my salary , so I can in principle start to fill in the application forms . 
^ However , I 'll first wait and see if you think these proposals are ok , because I need to make all kinds of ' aims and objectives ' summaries in the application form . 
^ Then there are bits that you probably need to look at -- but I 'll get back to you about those later . 
^ Many thanks , &NAME

^ This is not in your style , of course , and you may in any case wish to alter the layout , but this is a start . 
^ I assume that &NAME will wish to copy my files , but before this is done , some questions occur to me : 
^ Is &NAME format sufficient ? 
^ Note that the diagram in Language Processing I question &NUM is not as handed to the students - I understand that they were told about a change to the diagram in the examination room , and this version takes account of that . 
^ I have a &NAME file ( and in some cases a .ps file ) for every question . 
^ Does &NAME want to look after these in case I go under a bus or , more likely , &NAME is superseded and we need to go back to the plain text ?

^ Sound very good ! 
^ I am happy to post any call for papers , 
^ &NAME . 
^ &NAME 
^ This all looks excellent . 
^ Thanks for getting the ball rolling . 
^ Getting &NAME and &NAME to do one on &NAME 's would be especially good since ( &CHAR ) its a hot topic in both speech and language , and ( &CHAR ) getting their names on the journal as guest editors would add further credibility to &NAME as a journal that &NAME folks should read .

^ &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME have agreed to do one on &NAME . 
^ There is a Senseval competition next summer they are both helping to organise next summer , so the plan is to draw many papers from participants but leave it open to others . 
^ They are preparing a call for us to vet and pass on to &NAME 
^ &NAME &NAME ( and possibly &NAME &NAME ) want to do one on structured language models for &NAME , &NAME etc -- &NAME suggested this as he was worried that not enough good material would be forthcoming for one on unsupervised grammar induction . 
^ Further down the road , there is the possibility of one on stochastic &NAME , based on a workshop / conference due to happen next spring I think , but the organisers are still thinking about it . 
^ With luck the &NAME &NUM wld be ready for 2nd quarter &NUM

^ I made experiments on the &NUM approaches and according to obtained results the second solution perfomes well . 
^ Therefore , the introduction of machine translation , in the process of categorization , helps to recognize the subject of a text . 
</TEXT_EMBEDDED>
<TEXT_NORMAL> 

^ The second solution seems yield more training examples for the single classifier , although the texts may be noisy ( but the labels are correct ) . 
^ So it may be due to these more training examples that improve the performance . 
^ The translator , as long as it is not too bad , plays less role in this case . 
^ This is just my conjecture .

^ A few people have spotted the evidence that we have started using a problem tracking system for dealing with queries to the system administrators . 
^ Although the system should be largely transparent , this is just a quick note to explain what is going on , and how you can help the system to run smoothly . 
^ A problem with support addresses such as sys-admin is that of ensuring that every problem is dealt with by somebody , and that we try to avoid wasted effort by having more than &NUM person pick up the same message . 
^ A secondary problem is that of keeping track of the correspondence for a long-running problem , especially when responsibility is transferred from &NUM person to another . 
^ We are therefore experimenting with a problem tracking system called &WEBSITE . 
^ Whenever a problem enters the system is is assigned a unique ticket number , which is put into the subject line of all further correspondence . 
^ You can help the system run smoothly by observing these guidelines : 
^ - Please try to confine an initial message to a single problem , or very closely related problems . 
^ If you put completely unrelated matters in a single message , it may be difficult to handle them in parallel , or a supplementary question may be missed . 
^ - If you want to add some correspondence to an existing query , always reply to a message which includes the ticket number if you have one . 
^ We will shortly be arranging that an automatic reply is sent out when a ticket is created . 
^ If you want to add more information before you have had a reply from a human , you can reply to this . 
^ The system is being introduced gradually , so in the short term you may find that some questions are answered the old way whilst others are given tickets . 
^ - When we believe a ticket has been resolved , you should get a message saying so . 
^ If you agree , do nothing . 
^ If you disagree , either immediately or after some time , replying to a message which has the ticket number will automatically reopen it ( with the advantage that we will be able to see the previous correspondence instantly ) .

^ Please reply to this email to confirm that you have indeed ' kept term ' for &NAME &NUM . 
^ ie you have been in &NAME all the time ( every night ) between 22nd April and 13th June . 
^ If you have missed any nights , these should have been made up in the period either side which extends from 17th April to 25th June . 
^ Last term I eventually got 100per cent replies - so thanks to you all . 
^ Some of you were a little late and did need chasing up though . 
^ Please make my job easier by replying promptly . 
^ If you are in any doubt as to how this message affects you , do please come and see me or send me a message . 
^ We can then discuss it informally . 
^ Those of you who have already completed the full quote of terms for their course ( eg &NUM terms for a PhD ) or have been granted leave to work away from the &NAME &NUM term will not need to ' keep term ' .
