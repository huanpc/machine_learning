' ^ with network marketing you have  um sources of income . ^ direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . ^ residual income is the secret of the wealthy . ^ it means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . ^ in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . ^ the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . ^ fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . ^ my   is  ame  ame . ^  um years ago , the corporation i worked for , the past  um years , down-sized and my position was eliminated . ^ after many unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . ^ over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . ^ i owed my family , friends and creditors over $  um ,  um . ^ i just could n't seem to make ends meet . ^ i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . ^ at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life , financially , forever ! ! ! ^ in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . ^  um month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . ^ all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . ^ they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . ^ one claimed that i would make a million dollars in  um year ... it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a best selling book to make it ! ^ but , as i was saying , in december of  um i received this program . ^ i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my   off a mailing list . ^ thank goodness for that ! ^ after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . ^ here was a money making phenomenon . ^ i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . ^ after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . ^ but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . ^ so i checked it out with the  ame  ame office (  um  um 24-hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! ^ after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided ' why not . ' ^ initially i sent out  um ,  um e-mails . ^ the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . ^ i 'm telling you as it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not ' rip-off ' anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . ^ in less than  um week , i was starting to receive orders for report #  um . ^ by january  um , i had received  um orders for report #  um . ^ your goal is to 'receive at least  um orders for report #  um within  um weeks . ^ if you do n't, send out more programs until you do ! ' ^ my first step in making $  um ,  um in  um days was done . ^ by january  um , i had received  um orders for report #  um . ^ your goal is to 'receive at least  um orders for report #  um within  um weeks . ^ if not , send out more programs until you do . ^ once you have  um orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $  um ,  um goal . ' well , i had  um orders for report #  um ,  um more than i needed . ^ so i sat back and relaxed . ^ by march  um , of my e-mailing of  um ,  um , i received $  um ,  um with more coming in every day . ^ i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . ^ please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ^ remember , it wo n't work if you do n't try it . ^ this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! ^ especially the rules of not trying to place your   in a different place . ^ it wo n't work , you 'll lose out on a lot of money ! ^ in order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of  um orders for report #  um , and  um orders for report #  um and you will make $  um ,  um or more in  um days . ^ i am living proof that it works ! ^ if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . ^ it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . ^ if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . ^ if you are a business owner and in financial trouble , as i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a good luck sign . ^ i did ! ^ sincerely , ^  ame  ame ^  ame do you have any idea what $  um ,  um looks like piled up on a kitchen table ? ^ it 's awesome ! ^  har personal note from the originator of this program : ^ by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program , one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . ^ let me tell you a little about myself . ^ i had a profitable business for  um years . ^ then in  um my business began falling off . ^ i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . ^ finally , i figured it out . ^ it was n't me , it was the economy . ^  ame and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since  um . ^ i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate ... because many of you know from first hand experience . ^ there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . ^ the middle class was vanishing . ^ those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . ^ those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . ^ as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ' the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to 'move up ' or ' get  ame ' . ^ you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with ' no risk ' and ' just a little bit of effort . ' you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . ^ i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . ^ i have already made over  um million dollars ! ^ i have retired from the program after sending out over  um ,  um programs . ^ follow the program exactly as instructed . ^ do not change it in any way . ^ it works exceedingly well as it is now . ^ remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . ^ one of the people you send this to may send out  um ,  um ... and your   will be on everyone of them ! ^ remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . ^ so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is now up to you ! ^ how this amazing program works ^ here 's how this amazing program will make you  um of dollars ^ instructions : ^ this method of raising capital really works  um % , every time . ^ i am sure that you could use up to $  um ,  um or more in the next  um days . ^ before you say ' bull ...
