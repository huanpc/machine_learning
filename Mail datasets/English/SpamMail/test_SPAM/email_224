year  ame - find $  um ,  um cash hidden in his closet   ^ does this headline look familiar ? ^ of course it does . ^ you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (  ame ) . ^ and reported elsewhere in the world . ^ his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . ^ nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . ^  ame bills ,  um ,  um and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . ^ 'my first thought was that he had robbed a bank ' , says the 41-year-old woman , ' there was over $  um ,  um dollars in that bag -- that 's more than my husband earns in a year ' . ^ the woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . ^ he came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . ^ little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . ^ as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e-mail , a type of ' report ' to e-mail addresses that he obtained off the  ame . ^ everyday after school for the past  um months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . ^ ' i just got the e-mail  um day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out ' , says the clever 15-year-old . ^ the e-mail letter listed  um addresses and contained instructions to send  um $  um dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . ^ the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in  ame bills within  um weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . ^ '  um get junk e-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work ' , the boy continues . ^ within the first few days of sending out the e-mail , the  ame office  ame that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines , but envelopes containing $  um bills . ^ ' about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had  um magazine and about  um envelops stuffed in it . ^ there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . ^ i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) ' . ^ he goes on , ' i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . ^ i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all ' . ^ over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e-mail .' the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework '  ame had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $  um bills for  um ,  um and hundreds . ^ '  ebsite reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at  ame fact , it was completely legal according to  ame  ame and  ame  ame ,  ame  um , section  um and  um , or title  um , section  um in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations ,  ame  um , sections  um and  um , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . ^ every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' please send me report number  ame ' .this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (  har report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . ^ [ this is the end of the media release . ^ if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $  um ,  um plus -
