' ^ surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . ^ the reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all . ^ in fact , it was completely legal according to  ame  ame and  ame  ame ,  ame  um , section  um and  um , or title  um , section  um in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations ,  ame  um , sections  um and  um , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . ^ every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' please send me report number  ame ' .this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (  har report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . ^ [ this is the end of the media release . ^ if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $  um ,  um please continue reading . ^ what appears below is what the  um year old was sending out on the net - you can  ame it too ^ - ju3dfor each report , send $  um cash , the name & number of the ^ report you are ordering and your e-mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . ^ make sure your return address is on your envelope  ame left corner in case of any mail problems . ^ you will need all  um reports so that you can save them on your computer . ^ within a few days you will receive , vie e-mail , each of the  um reports from these  um different individuals . ^ save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the  um , 000's of people who will order them from you . ^ also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . ^ important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step '  um through  um ' or you will loose out on majority of your profits . ^ once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . ^ remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! ! ! ^ people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all  um thinking they could get all the money . ^ but it does not work this way . ^ believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . ^ so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . ^ because if you do , it will not work for you . ^ remember , honesty reaps the reward !
