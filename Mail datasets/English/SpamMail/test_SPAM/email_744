others only when afflicted with hay fever , allergies , a cold or sinus infection . ^ infants and children are particularly vulnerable . ^ according to dr.  ame  ame  ame , of the ear institute in  ame  ame and surgeon  ame  ame of the  ame  ame , this painful condition can be avoided . ^ here are some trip tips to get you through a flight . ^ all of the remedies restore the pressure equalizing function of the eustachian tube which normally opens for a fraction of a second about once every  um minutes in response to swallowing or yawning . ^  um  ame  ame , suck candy or yawn vigorously on take-off and landing , to equalize pressure in the middle ear . ^  um stay awake for ascents and descents because we swallow less when asleep . ^  ame up sleeping children and infants as well . ^  um  ame a pacifier or bottle in an infant 's mouth to encourage swallowing . ^  um drink water . ^ avoid coffee and alcohol . ^  um take nasal spray shortly before boarding the aircraft . ^ use it  um minutes before landing and again every  um minutes for  um minutes . ^  um if your ears plug up during ascent , hold your nose and swallow . ^ this helps suck excess air pressure out of the middle ear . ^  um on descent , try the  ame maneuver ; hold your nose and blow forcibly to get air up the eustachian tube into the middle ear . ^ do not do this if you have an upper respiratory infection . ^ persistent ear pain after landing could signify an infection that should be treated by a doctor . ^ doctors  ame airport food -- before you pack your bags , you may want to consult the physicians committee for responsible medicine 's (  ame 's) new review of airport food at the busiest  ame airports . ^ the airport  ame rating survey is available at  ebsite the physicians ' group evaluated airport restaurants based on which served the most low-fat , high-fiber , cholesterol-free meals . ^ for the second year in a row ,  ame  ame international airport landed the highest marks with  um percent of all its restaurants offering a healthy option . ^  ame took a nosedive from last year 's number  um ranking to finish at number  um . ^ ' because of national security issues , people are spending more of their time waiting around in airports than ever before . ^ and although more people may need to eat before or between flights , healthy meals can be hard to find in more than half of the airports we surveyed , ' says  ame dietitian ,  ame  ame ,  ame ,  ame the survey found the average percentage of healthy options remained about the same , with some airports improving and others dropping by as many as  um percentage points . ^ a restaurant was rated ' healthy ' if it offered at least  um low-fat , high-fiber , cholesterol-free entree . ^ to get the percentage score ,  ame divided the number of ' healthy restaurants ' by the total number of restaurants . ^ ' while a number of restaurants made healthy additions to their menu , the most dramatic addition was  ame  ame 's  ame  ame , a veggie burger which debuted last may . ^ some airports have as many as  um  ame  ame restaurants , making it much easier to find a low-fat , vegetarian option , even where you 'd least expect it , ' says  ame  ame . ^ here are the scores for the  um busy airports plus the number of healthy restaurants and total restaurants . ^ san  ame  um ,  um /  um ;

' every few kilometers , the barge stops to transit a canal lock . ^ while the barge sits in the lock rising or lowering to the next plateau , passengers can get on and off the barge . ^ bicycles are on board each barge so passengers can ride along the path that parallels the canal . ^ the  ame travels so slow that you can ride a bike , walk at your own speed or explore the surroundings and easily meet up with the barge . ^  ame , one of the passengers who loved to walk for his daily exercise , would power ahead on the path and wait for the  ame to arrive several locks down . ^ while  ame went full-steam-ahead , other passenger simply sat on the  ame 's outside deck and watched the countryside drift by . ^ this freedom lets you be as active or inactive as you choose . ^ excursions do n't compete with sailing . ^ each day featured a trip by bus to a nearby town . ^ passengers return from excursions for lunch . ^ as soon as the lunch dishes are cleared , the  ame starts to sails along the canal headed toward that evening 's mooring . ^ the  um optional trip many of the passengers took was a hot air balloon ride over the vineyards and valleys of  ame . ^ our first day 's excursion took us on a tour of the 12th century chateau at  ame , which is privately owned and still lived in , and the medieval hilltop village of  ame en  ame . ^ wander the village 's well-worn cobblestones streets and you 'll find several small cafes , a couple of antique shops and a gift shop or  um , frequented more by villagers than tourists . ^  ame en  ame is not about buying t-shirts or visiting a  ame 's. ^ the village is about atmosphere , a glimpse at life in the past , where you can admire the ancient architecture , pet the plethora of cats sitting in ancient leaded windows or watch children and their mothers go about their daily routines . ^ from the hilltop vantage point at the edge of the tiny village ,  ame our guide , pointed out landmarks in this sweeping panorama , including the  ame docked at  ame , our arrival point . ^ other days trips included a visit to a winery for a wine tasting , market day in  ame and  ame , the center of the wine trade in  ame . ^ each trip allowed time for shopping or exploring on your own . ^ for more information on the  ame , visit  ebsite for an in-depth ship review , purchase the electronic  ame  ame report -
