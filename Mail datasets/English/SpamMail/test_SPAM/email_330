'  ebsite reporting news ^ team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at  ame fact , it was completely legal according to  ame  ame and  ame  ame ,  ame  um , section  um and  um , or title  um , section  um in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations ,  ame  um , sections  um and  um , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . ^ every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' please send me report number  ame ' .this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service (  har report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . ^ [ this is the end of the media release . ^ if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $  um ,  um - please continue reading . ^ what appears below is what the  um year old was sending out on the net - you can  ame it too - just follow the simple instructions ] . ^ be financially free like others within a year ! ! ! ^ before you say '  ame ' , please read the following . ^ this is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . ^ due to the popularity of this letter on the  ame , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . ^ the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . ^ their findings proved once and for all that there are ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $  um out of pocket cost ' . ^ due to the recent increase of popularity & respect this program has attained , it is currently working better than ever . ^ note * follow the directons below , i had best results the second time when  har hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . ^ in order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . ^ i have been extremely successful using the following company . ^ they send out the offers , and all i do is accept money for reports , then i send back to the people as soon as possible . ^ this is what one had to say : ' thanks to this profitable opportunity . ^ i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it . ^ i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . ^ to my astonishment , i received total $  um ,  um in  um weeks , with money still coming in ' . ^  ame  ame ,  ame  ame ,  ame  ame . ^ here is another testimonial : ' this program has been around for a long time but i never believed in it . ^ but  um day when i received this again in the mail i decided to gamble my $  um on it . ^ i followed the simple instructions and walaa . . ...  um weeks later the money started to come in. first month i only made $  um but the next  um months after that i made a total of $  um ,  um . ^ so far , in the past  um months by re- entering the program , i have made over $  um ,  um and i am playing it again . ^ the key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and not change anything .
