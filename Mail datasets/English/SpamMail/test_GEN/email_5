' i do not find that acting or arguing against boycotting individuals on the basis of their nationality ( rather than point of view or actions ) diverts either my attention or my energy away from engaging actively for peace in the middle east . ^ quite to the contrary : as an  ame who has been activley engaged in dialogue with palestinian friends and colleagues for over  um decades now , i feel that the only hope we have is to continue to make use of the freedoms we have as academics to meet and draft ideas for a better future , and for life in peace and collaboration in a country which we must share . ^ recall that the talks that had led to the  ame accords of the early  um ( which  ame appears to oppose , but which brought the only prospect of peace for over a century ) , had been initiated by palestinian and  ame academics , meeting abroad , defying a ban on contacts issued by hardliners on both sides . ^ if we restrict our own freedoms by banning contacts , as  ame wants , we are doing a service only to those whose aim is to separate our  um peoples and to prevent them from ever reaching any common ground . ^ the presidents raise concern over ' the potential infringement of  ame 's liberty ' , and say that ' whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action , such as the boycott of the  ame academic community , is not an issue for the employing organisation . ' . ^ i strongly disagree . ^  um cannot pretend that we are talking about what an individual acdemic is doing in her free time . ^ the issue is rather , which standards of academic practice are being set in the public life of our own academic community . ^  ame 's actions were not personal ; they were public gestures by a senior colleague , aimed at changing the standards by which most of us operate . ^ as members of an academic association in this country , it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour . ^ it is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate . ^ the issue of whether or not it is acceptable to ban fellow academics based on their nationality or country of residence or place of work belongs to the code of practice of this academic community . ^ the issue of whether or not  ame discriminates the  ame ( or  ame the  ame , or  ame the catholics in  ame  ame ) , or how to react to such discrimination , does not belong to that code of practice , and is beyond the remit of either the  ame or an academic institution like  ame . ^ in this last respect , i very much regret the double standards that we seem to have in the  ame : last autumn , at the  ame business meeting , i proposed that we should react to the press reports concerning the  ame secretary 's statements on the use of mother tongue by immigrants in their homes . ^ instead of deciding to act , the assembly accepted a proposal that i should first establish what exactly had been said , that i should then put together a report summarising current research on bilingualism in the family , that i should then draft a reaction citing this research , and then go on to poll the membership via this list , and hope to come up with an agreed statement still to be issued before public opinion completely lost interest in the matter . ^ it turned out that  ame had not said what some of the press attributed to him . ^ nonetheless , his statement was ambiguous enough to deserve , in my opinion , a reaction clarifying that it is incorrect and improper to suggest a link between linguistic diversity and lack of modernity (  ame 's text suggested a link between acquiring english and modernity , while addressing the alleged monolingualism of a large proportion of immigrants ) . ^ but it took many days to negotiate a text to present on this list , and even the text that was agreed on was not , for some reason , passed on to the list , but was substituted by a notice stripped of any evaluative content . ^ the  ame was not , it seemed , as interested in reacting to an issue situated on its own doorstep and which demanded its profesional expertise , as much as it enjoys the inspiration of  ame  ame 's ' ban them ! ' campaign . ^ perhaps it 's pity that the powers that determine events in  ame /  ame are even less affected by what the  ame says than the british  ame secretary . ^  ame  ame </text_normal><text_embedded> ^  ame :  mail  ame :  ame ,  um  ame  um  um :  um :  um  um to :  mail from :  ame  ame (  mail ) subject : for information  ame :  um  ame : found to be clean sender :  mail  ame : bulk  ame :  ame  ame (  mail )  ame : exiscan for exim4 (  ebsite ^ * 18mp9x-0007tq-00 * m4b2qxta5aq * status : ^ dear  ame colleague , this is to report that the recent past presidents of the  ame have written a letter to the press in support of a fellow linguist . ^ the letter was published in today 's edition of the  rg . ^ the wording makes it clear that we wrote as individuals , not on behalf of the  ame , but we felt that  ame members should know about it because we mention the  ame . ^ the text of the letter , as published , follows . ^  ame  ame ^ we are writing in support of  ame  ame , who is under investigation by the university of  ame institute for science and technology for removing  um  ame members from the editorial board of a journal she privately owns and publishes . ^ we may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the linguistics association of  ame  ame . ^ we believe that  ame 's treatment of  ame and subsequent publicity are disproportionate . ^ although  ame denies considering dismissal ,  ame has been publicly reprimanded on the  ame website and an inquiry set in motion . ^ like the rest of the academic community , we are divided over whether or not the boycott of  ame institutions is justified , and even more so over whether  ame was right to extend it to individual  ame scholars . ^ however , we all agree that the discrimination by  ame against the  ame raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott , and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention . ^ we are also concerned at the potential infringement of  ame 's liberty by  ame and at the precedent this would set . ^ whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action , such as the boycott of the  ame academic community , is not an issue for the employing organisation . ^  ame  ame  ame university  ame  ame university of  ame  ame  ame and  ame  ame university college  ame  ame  ame  ame college  ame  ame  ame university of  ame ^ if you want more information about the background , a good source is an article in thursday 's  ame (  ame ) , which you can find at  ebsite ^  ame (  ame )  ame </text_embedded><text_normal> ^  ame  ame department of  ame university of  ame  ame road  ame  ame  ame ,  ame ^ phone  um  um  um  ame  um  um  um e-mail  mail ^  ame  ame :  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
