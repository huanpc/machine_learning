^ u|v / ' cries ' x|y  har ' the ' '  ame ' ^ the syntax learner could then discover the following unknowns : ^  har  har sx / ' cries '  har /  har  har ' the ' '  ame ' ^ the input to the system is a collection of utterances paired with semantic representations . ^ these semantic representations are the hypothesised meanings a child may assume for an utterance . ^ the correct interpretation may or may not be included amongst the semantic representations . ^ the affect of this type of noise on the system may also be investigated . ^ children learn their native tongue because it is the language of their environment . ^ in the early stages of acquisition the only language that children are exposed to is that of their caketakers . ^ this implies that the caretakers ' utterances are the only input needed to begin acquisition . ^ to mirror this situation , from which children actually learn , i use real data ; the interaction between a child and her parents . ^ since the child involved did successfully learn english , it is reasonable to assume that the utterances the child heard the parents say are sufficient for learning ( provided a capable model and correct starting assumptions can be found ) . ^ the  ame 's corpus of the  ame database has been used for this work . ^ the corpus contains a selection of interactions between a child and her parents from the age of  um year  um month to  um years and  um month . ^ the corpus has been preprocessed by  ame . ^ all phonological annotations and grammatical structures not covered by her grammar , including interjections and elliptical material , have been removed . ^ the child 's sentences were also excluded from those remaining so that the parents ' sentences only are given as input to the system . ^ the learner has been run on the first  um utterances of the corpus . ^ the semantics learner will currently achieve recall of  um with precision  um . ^ the syntactic learner is dependant upon the recall of the semantic learner in that it can only proceed when a skeleton syntactic category is available for every word in the utterance ; when this is the case the success rate is high with precision in the high  ame . ^ a previous investigation into lexical acquisition in the framework of a categorial grammar was discussed by  ame . ^ his approach differs from this in several respects . ^  ame 's syntactic learner was entirely algebraic in nature ; the syntactic categories were derived by solving a set of simultaneous equations . ^ in order to constrain his search space  ame had to specify the syntactic categories allowed . ^ this meant defining a category set before learning began . ^ this is equivalent to assuming a child has innate knowledge of which syntactic categories are allowed in it 's language . ^ the learner presented here is not restricted in this way . ^  ame 's learner was used in conjunction with a parameter setting system (  ame ) in order to  ame hypothesised category sets . ^ for this purpose the learner was successful but  ame still made several assumptions that would correspond to innate language ability in a child . ^ in order to investigate these assumptions a new learning model is needed . ^ the learner presented can acquire language from reasonably little prior knowledge and as a result the effects on learning rate as introduced by these and other assumptions can be investigated . ^ references :  ame  ame - learning natural language within the framework of categorial grammar - 3rd  ame  ame research colloquium ,  um . ^  ame  ame - a computational study of  ame  ame techniques for learning word-to-meaning mappings -  ame  ame num.1-2 pp.  um ,  ame /  ame  um  ame  ame - the acquisition of a unification-based generalised categorial grammar -  ame  ame ,  ame university ,  um </text_normal></message_body></message>
