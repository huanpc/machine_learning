' ^  ame lives in  ame . ' ^  ame  um . ^ the textual record is linked to the person , and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity . ^ for instance , mrs.  ame in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary , make references to locations , etc. that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in  ame . ^ the distinction is not sharp , and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways . ^ linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun '  um ' using the ' sender : ' field of the email rather than a name in the text . ^ in practice , however , i find the  um to be very different . ^ in particular ,  ame  um is much more susceptible to text classification approaches . ^ one assumes the whole document is ' about ' the person to which it is linked , and you classify the person by classifying the document . ^ in  ame  um , however , you have to be much more serious about the  ame , since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you 're interested in , and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference . ^ anyway , i 'm trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about  ame  um vs.  ame  um . ^ '  ame ' vs. '  ame ' ? ^ ' third person vs. first person ' ? ^ any suggestions ? ^ cheers ,  ame ^  ame  ame  ame  ebsite  ame on text categorization / filtering / search / mining / ( your need here ) </text_embedded></message_body></message>
