' ^ however , after pulling in ' actress ' , '  ame ' and '  ame ' ( as all  um had '  ame ' arg ) the  ame selected the correct ( following ) sentence : earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in  ame memorial park . ^ earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on actress  ame  ame mausoleum in  ame memorial park . ^ the real problem is that the shallow parsed  ame structures result in very few  ame elements - so the  ame system is already based mainly upon  ame and carg matches . ^ therefore without  ame  ame representations to start with you are almost always only pulling in the antecedent itself . ^ hope that 's ok - i 'll be home tomorrow morning if you need to call me ! ^  ame : ) ^ on  ame  um  um ,  ame  ame wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ here is the almost final version . ^ i am off home now , but will check my email later to include any further comments / results . ^ i 've revised the script to deal with comments , the  ame paper and your new results , there are a couple of ? ? ^  har where i 'll put in results for an intermediate approach incorporating just predications with a direct link to the variable in the antecedent head . ^ if thy do n't materialise by tomorrow evn i 'll just blather ... ^  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
