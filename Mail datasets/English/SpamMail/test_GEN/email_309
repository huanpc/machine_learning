' of course , we are perfectly aware that it is not pleasant to have a submitted paper discarded but that is not the question ( each of us has already published a large number of papers in his life , and knows what a review process is ) . ^ in your answer you add : '  ame , i submitted a paper to lingua which argued against the work on language evolution by xxx . ^ when the reports arrived , it was clear that he was  um of the referees ( ... ) this is by no means an isolated experience for me : in my experience both with the  ame  ame ( of which i am an editor ) and in my own research , it is ^ * normal * for  um of the reviewers to be the person whose work is called into question ' . ^ we do not think that this procedure is * normal * , particularly if there are only  um reviewers , and there is a serious problem with the present review process . ^ indeed , the main opponent has been chosen as reviewer , which is definitely not correct , the more so since he used a number of arguments that clearly escape the scientific debate ( e.g. fraud accusation which is absolutely unacceptable , and that we will certainly not accept and let propagate as such ; and a curious citation about  ame  ame and  ame  ame , which has obviously nothing to do in a review process ) . ^ hence we are in a situation in which since the beginning , it is obvious that  um reviewer over  um will fight against this paper by any means ( even arguable  um ) and certainly refuse it . ^ this is definitely unacceptable . ^ we feel that you and ph.  ame are unable to take the measure of a controversy which is fair and needs to be editorially processed with a debate . ^ we will let the community ( and first the programme committee of  ame  um and the editors of journals in the field of phonetics and  ame  ame ) know about this review process , and make their own judgment . ^ we hope that it will help improve further debates happen in a sounder way in the future . ^ sincerely yours  ame  ame ,  ame ,  ame  ame , christian  ame ^  ame - surprisingly , the  um reviewers of our abstract to the  ame conference , were quite positive about our work , as you can see . ^ fourth international conference on the evolution of language  ame , march  um ,  um ^ dear colleague , ^ thank you for submitting an abstract to this conference . ^ i am pleased to tell you that the abstract submitted under the first-author name below has been accepted as the basis for a talk for the conference . ^ boe ^ meanwhile , i include , beneath the dashed line , our referees ' comments on your abstract . ^ best wishes ,  ame  ame ^ title of paper : the size of the pharynx : an irrelevant parameter for speech emergence and acquisition ^ since  ame &  ame postulated in  um the theory that  ame were a speechless species , the potential speech capability of  ame has been a debated question . ^ these authors claimed that the development of a low laryngeal position was a necessary condition for the realization of a sufficient number of vocalic contrasts , since the potential vowel space was enlarged due to an enlarged pharyngeal cavity . ^ like newborn infants ,  ame did not possess this ' anatomical basis of speech ' , and therefore could not speak . ^ in this study , we refute the  ame arguments developed by  ame &  ame . ^ we quantify the vocal tract geometry by a  ame  ame index corresponding to the length ratio of the pharyngeal cavity to the oral cavity . ^ using a new anthropomorphic articulatory model controlled by lips , jaw and tongue parameters , we introduce variations of the  ame to approximate a vocal tract of a newborn infant , a child , a female adult and a male adult . ^ we generate the potential maximum acoustic vowel space ( with  um ,  um vowel items ) corresponding to these  ame  ame index variations and we compare the results in the acoustic spaces of the first  um formants with well known data of phonemes of the world 's languages . ^ our simulations show that the maximal vowel space of a given vocal tract does not depend on the  ame  ame index : gestures of the tongue body , lips and jaw allow compensation for differences in the ratio between the dimensions of the oral cavity and pharynx . ^ we infer that the vowel space of  ame ( with high or low larynx ) was no smaller than that of a modern human and that they could produce all the vowels of the world 's languages . ^ our study is strictly limited to the morphological and acoustic aspects of the vocal tract , and we cannot therefore offer any definitive answer to the question of whether  ame spoke or not . ^ however , we do feel safe in claiming that  ame were not morphologically handicapped for speech . ^ a low larynx ( and large pharynx ) cannot be considered to be the ' anatomical prerequisites for producing the full range of human speech ' . ^ if  ame could not talk , it is unlikely to have been for the articulatory acoustic reasons advocated by  ame &  ame . ^  ame were no more vocally handicapped than children at birth are . ^ the brain is entirely capable of controlling a vocal instrument with a somewhat longer or shorter pharynx : these differences do not actually change the capacity for maximally contrasting vowels . ^ there is therefore no reason to believe that the lowering of the larynx and a concomitant increase in pharynx size are necessary evolutionary pre-adaptations for speech . ^ referee  um ^ definitely accept . ^ convincing attempt to deal with a previously proposed aspect of the theory of speech evolution by deducing corollaries from emprical  ame analysis . ^ referee  um ^ definitely accept . ^ this paper is among the first to challenge the well known hypothesis of  ame and his colleagues concerning the role of the lowered larynx in expanding the potential vowel space of  ame sapiens , a hypothesis that has largely gone unchallenged ( despite sceptical murmurs from the wings ) for nearly  um years . ^ the argument of the paper may not be without its difficulties , in so far as it rests on a model of vowel production by a modern vocal tract . ^ moreover , if  ame 's hypothesis is indeed false , we are left without a plausible account of why the larynx lowered and , as  ame observed , increased the probability of death by choking . ^ nonetheless , the author 's thesis is clearly argued and will doubtless stimulate much valuable discussion at the conference . ^  ame  ame email :  mail institut de la  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  um  um grenoble cedex  um  ame  ame  ame  ame :  um  um  um  um  um  ame :  um  um  um  um  um <text_embedded> ^ from foreign parts  ame : int +  um  um  um  um  um  um  ame : int +  um  um  um  um  um  um  ame  ame  ame :  um  um  um  um  um </text_embedded></text_embedded></message_body></message>
