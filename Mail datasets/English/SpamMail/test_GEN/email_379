' ^ all we said was ' we * may * speak for a large body of opinion ' . ^ not that we ^ * did * speak for a large body , less still that we spoke for the whole of the  ame . ^ when i signed it i thought it was a reasonable assumption that , since presidents are elected , there must be quite a lot of people who accept them as similar in values etc. when one of past presidents agree on something , it seems likely that quite a few other members would agree on it as well . ^ maybe i was wrong , but i do n't think any of us know . ^  ame asks ' why now ? ' no particular reason ( except that christmas had been mentioned by  um journalist as the deadline for the  ame inquiry ) . ^ maybe we should have acted sooner . ^ just to remind you of the points we did and did not make in the letter : ^ - we did * not * make any judgement on  ame  ame 's form of the boycott ; the rights and wrongs of this were n't at issue . ^ - we * did * say  ame 's treatment of her was over the top . ^ - we * did * say we objected to  ame 's assumption that it had the right to inquire into her private political activities . ^ personally i stick by the last  um of these points . ^  ame ^  ame (  ame )  ame ^  ame and linguistics , university college  ame ,  ame street ,  ame  ame  ame . ^  um (  um )  um  um  um ; fax  um (  um )  um  um  um ;  ebsite </text_embedded></text_embedded><text_normal> ^  ame (  ame )  ame ^ phonetics and linguistics , university college  ame ,  ame street ,  ame  ame  ame . ^  um (  um )  um  um  um ; fax  um (  um )  um  um  um ;  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
