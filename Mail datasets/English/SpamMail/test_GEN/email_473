^ perhaps , but that depends on a very iffy judgement call . ^ the lesson seems to be that great care is needed in collecting informed consent for corpus work . ^ none of this addresses the additional point made in  ame 's post about collateral damage to people and organisations not involved in the recording . ^ i could imagine a prosecution against both participants and corpus distributors for defamation or slander . ^ that would be bad . ^ perhaps corpus collectors need to indemnify participants against this , or perhaps it suffices to warn people that they are ( in effect ) speaking in a public place . ^ or perhaps we have a duty of care to ensure that our participants do not put themselves at risk ( doubly likely since many corpora include contributions by children ) . ^ and that leaves aside the much more likely cases where nasty stuff in the corpus evokes resentment and unhappiness , but not enough to lead to prosecutions . ^  ame ^ dr.  ame  ame , assistant professor of computational linguistics department of linguistics ,  um  ame avenue ,  ame oh  um  ame :  um  um  um  ame :  um  um  um web :  ebsite </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ on  ame  ame 's posting , to me there is an important difference between ' bad language ' and individuals ' names , or information that could lead to identification of individuals . ^ like  ame  ame , i do n't believe there is any real reason to censor the ' bad language ' ; it is important linguistic data , and we are all grown-ups . ^ but i do think that before such a resource is made public , strenuous efforts should be made to eliminate any possibility of users identifying either the individuals who produced the material , or any individuals or individual institutions written about . ^ actually , under various national data protection laws i suspect it might be illegal not to do this , even if the material is simply held at  um institution and not circulated . ^ but it ought to be done anyway , for reasons that i discuss at some length in the ' ethics ' section of the documention file accompanying my  ame corpus ( available via the web , from my home page  ebsite christine ) . ^ i discuss there what seems to me to have been inadequate practice in this respect in the spoken section of the british national corpus . ^ there are places where really damaging things are said in a quite casual way in conversation about people , or organizations , who / which might easily be identified by people who know them ( and could probably be identified by strangers with only minimal detective work ) . ^ the recorded speakers had no motive to worry about this , but i believe corpus  ame have a responsibility not to let such casual gossip about identifiable people be turned into permanent public records . ^  ame  ame ^ prof.  ame  ame ma  ame  ame ^ professor of natural language  ame school of cognitive & computing sciences university of  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame ^ e-mail  mail ( no attachments please )  ame . ^  um  um  um fax  um  um  um web  ebsite </text_embedded><text_normal></text_normal></message_body></message>
