ownership of copyright in lecture notes or books except where explicitly ^ agreed as part of a commissioning process , for example as might occur for the ^ creation of material for e-learning.94 ^ the head of department interpreted this to mean that the authors of mater ial ^ which is explicitly commissioned would have to agree to the commissioning and ^ the transfer of copyright . ^ as far as he was aware , no such commissioned ^ material for teaching under the syndicate 's jurisdiction had been produ ced . ^ it was his belief that if the syndicate felt that there was a case for ^ material to be commissioned , for example for an e-learning course , then he ^ would consult the department before proceeding . ^ he suggested that ' license to use ' rather than copyright transfer would then be a more appropriate approach . ^ following further discussion , professor  ame reiterated that the position ^ was clear : copyright remained firmly in the hands of the author . ^  um calculators for
