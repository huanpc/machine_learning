the second workshop hosted by nasa  ame in  ame  ame ,  um ; the third hosted by  ame in  ame beach in  um ; and the fourth hosted by nasa  ame in  ame  ame ) . ^  ame  ame is an emerging field that applies evolution to automate design and adaptation of physical reconfigurable and morphable structures such as electronic systems , antennas ,  ame and robots . ^ the purpose of this conference is to bring together leading researchers from the evolvable hardware community , representatives of the automated design and programmable / reconfigurable hardware communities , technology developers and end-users from the aerospace , military and commercial sectors . ^  ame hardware techniques enable self-reconfigurability , adaptability and learning by programmable devices and thus have the potential to significantly increase the functionality of deployable hardware systems . ^  ame  ame is expected to have major impact on deployable systems for space systems and defense applications that need to survive and perform at optimal functionality during long duration in unknown , harsh and / or changing environments . ^ it is also expected to greatly enhance the capability of systems that need modification , upgrade and learning without interrupting their operation . ^ the focus of this year 's conference will be evolvable hardware for reliability . ^ reliability issues range from fault-recovery and survivable nasa / dod systems operating in extreme environments to intelligent adaptive and learning systems for protection of areas and security of communications . ^ topics to be covered include , but are not limited to : evolutionary hardware design co-evolution of hybrid systems , such as wetware , chemical , mechanical , and electronic components , etc. intrinsic / on-line and extrinsic / off-line evolution hardware / software co-evolution self-repairing , reconfiguring , and fault tolerant hardware  ame hardware novel devices , testbeds and tools supporting evolvable hardware  ame computing and adaptive hardware real-world applications of evolvable hardware , such as : ^ -  ame and watermarking of digital data ^ - radiation hardening ^ -  ame ^ -  ame and identification of biological agents and extraterrestrial lifeforms ( astrobiology ) ^ - ultra-safe systems ^ submission of papers ^ prospective authors are invited to submit their work by email in  ame ,  ame , or  ame formats to  mail . ^ the paper is limited to  um pages and should be submitted in single-spaced ,  um point type on a  um '  har  um ' or equivalent paper with  um ' margins on all sides . ^ each submission should contain the following items : (  um ) title of paper , (  um ) author name (  har ) , (  um ) first author physical address , (  um ) first author e-mail address , (  um ) first author phone number , (  um ) a maximum  um words abstract . ^ accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings . ^ the conference will maintain its single-track forma and will include posters sessions and panel discussions . ^ each research group is invited to prepare a poster describing their research . ^ a one-page abstract of the poster should be submitted following the same procedures as the paper . ^ for further information please contact :  ame  ame eh-2003 conference chair nasa  ame research center ,  ame  um mountain  ame , ca  um ,  ame  mail  ame :  um (  um )  um  ame :  um (  um )  um ^ important dates submission deadline : march  um ,  um author notification : april  um ,  um camera ready manuscript deadline : may  um ,  um conference : july  um ,  um ^ conference venue : the  ame  ame avenue ,  ebsite ^ organizing committee ^  ame  ame nasa  ame research center (  ame )  ame  ame  ame  ame laboratory (  ame )  ame  ame  ame space flight center (  ame ) ^ program chair :  ame  ame  ame  ame laboratory (  ame )  ame  ame  ame  ame laboratory (  ame ) ^ local chair :  ame  um  ame  ame  ame laboratory (  ame ) ^ program committee :  ame  ame , university of  ame ( uk )  ame  ame ,  ame polytechnic institute and state university (  ame )  ame  ame  ame  um ,  ame corporation (  ame )  ame  ame ,  ame university of technology (  ame )  ame  ame  ame , nasa  ame research center (  ame )  ame  ame ,  ame of  ame (  ame )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame university (  ame )  ame  ame  ame ,  ame state university (  ame )  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , university of  ame ( uk )  ame  ame , swiss federal institute of technology (  ame )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame university ( uk )  ame  ame  ame , natural selection , inc.
