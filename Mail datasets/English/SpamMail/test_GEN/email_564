^ how should they be combined ? ^ do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? ^ can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? ^ * evaluation of  ame systems . ^ which metrics are most informative and would new  um be useful ? ^ can  ame be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? ^ can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? ^ can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? ^ * sense distinctions and sense inventories . ^ how do these affect  ame ? ^ how does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the  ame task ? ^ are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? ^ what can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? ^ * the effect of  ame on applications . ^ to what extent does  ame help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? ^ what kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? ^ what is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? ^ * minimising the need for handtagged data . ^  ame text is expensive and difficult to obtain while untagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . ^ what techniques can be used to make use of untagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? ^ what use can be made of parallel text ? ^ can untagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ? ^ important dates ^ submission  um october  um notification of acceptance  um november  um  ame copy due  um december  um ^ submission information ^ all submissions will be subject to the normal peer review process for this journal . ^ submissions in electronic form (  ame ) are strongly preferred and must conform to the  ame specifications , which are available at : ^  ebsite ^ any initial queries , should be addressed to  mail </text_embedded></message_body></message>
