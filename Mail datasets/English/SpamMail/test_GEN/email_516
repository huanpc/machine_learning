^ are there benefits in having  um of the population aged  um undertake a university degree ? ^ b. the government 's initiatives to promote fair access include : reforming the funding scheme , providing grants for students from lower income families , and appointing an independent access regulator to oversee admissions . ^ are these measures enough ? ^ what should the government do to promote fair access to higher education ? ^ c. is the appointment of an independent access regulator welcomed ? ^ d. the bulk of expansion will be towards more two-year work-focused foundation degrees . ^ are these a good idea ? ^  um education and the business economy ^ a. the report makes much of ' harnessing knowledge to wealth creation ' . ^ is the present government 's focus on the financial benefits of a university education , and financial returns from university research damaging ? ^ can the benefits of academia , whether research or teaching , be measured in purely financial terms ? ^ b. in order to encourage the transfer of knowledge and technologies between academia and business the government is setting up a network of ' knowledge exchanges ' , and increasing the funding to the higher education innovation fund . ^ are such initiatives worthwhile , or would the funding be better spent in other ways ? ^  um funding of infrastructure and teaching ^ a. the government is aiming to ' undo the years of under-investment ' in higher education . ^ this is to be accomplished by increasing the funding available by more than  um percent over the next  um years , developing incentives to support and improve research , investing more in leading research departments , and increasing spending on research . ^ are these measures enough ? ^ are the figures the government provides enough to reverse the trend of under investment in this sector ? ^ b. should universities be allowed to set their own fees ( or ' graduate contributions ' ) per course ? ^ is it fair to tie such fees to an access  ame ? ^  har . ^ can the government do more to encourage the creation of endowment funds ? ^  um student finance ^ a. are the proposals for student finance fair ? ^ is it reasonable to ask students to contribute to their education by paying fees ? ^ is a deferred contribution the best way to administer this ? ^ b.  ame the current proposals to increase student debt act as a deterrent to students contemplating entry into higher education ? ^ is the introduction of higher levels of student debt at odds with the governments aim to increase access to universities ? ^ c. the proposals for student debt do not take into consideration the fact that a large proportion of women take career breaks to raise a family . ^ with the average salary for women graduates lower than that of men , this would mean that most women would take longer to pay back their student debts than their male counterparts . ^ does the governments proposals for deferred contributions disadvantage women ? ^  um research assessment ^ a. the government aims to develop criteria to assess the strength and quality of research . ^ is this necessary , or welcomed ? ^ should the government be directly involved in the choice of the type of research that is funded ? ^ b. is creating a new '  um * ' category in the research assessment exercise necessary ? ^  um . ^ teaching ^ a. the government has proposed new national professional standards for teaching , and a new body to develop and promote good teaching - the  ame  ame  ame . ^ are these welcomed ? ^ b. the government has proposed a national training programme for external examiners . ^ is this necessary ? ^ c. the university title will be made dependent on teaching degree awarding powers , meaning it will no longer be necessary to have research degree awarding powers to become a university . ^ is it wise to divorce teaching and research in this manner ? ^ should a ' university ' have to award research as well as teaching degrees ? ^ d. is there a demand for the establishment of an independent adjudicator to deal with student complaints ? ^ should government provide legislation for this ? ^  um are there any other points that you think should be raised regarding this paper ? ^ - ------ end of forwarded message </text_normal></message_body></message>
