' ^ on the contrary : your letter states , ' as members of an academic association in this country , it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour . ^ it is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate . ' ^ i take it , then , that you agree with ad  ame , who says ' i think we all have the intellectual responsibility to debate exactly these issues . ' ^ thank you for furthering this debate and pointing out some subtleties involved in the issue in question . ^  ame  ame </text_normal></message_body></message>
