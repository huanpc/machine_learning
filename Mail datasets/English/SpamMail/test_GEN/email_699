perhaps over  um . ^ for example , i would hope that my work will contribute towards making the following activity possible : a market analyst submits  um articles from the financial  ame on the footwear industry to an online service she enters the key topic areas of interest ( eg growth , risk , retail demand , innovation ) online service produces ^ - a summary of key facts and related author sentiments on these topics ^ - a clear statement of certainty on each area ^  um proposed research i intend to conduct applied research into a modular system which contains the following components : ^  um  um . ^ sentiment selection by user  ame the resources and processes to enable users to select sentiments , which will embrace :  har ) user choice from pre-defined sentiments  har ) user-defined sentiments  har ) selecting multiple simultaneous sentiments ^  um  um . ^ classifier data enrichment to support advanced polling of multiple classifiers :  har ) simultaneous deployment of multiple classifiers ( eg naive , vector distance ,  ame , adjective-adverb phrase ,  ame )  har ) generation of secondary data to record the certainty of the classification  har ) generation of tertiary data to enable the subsequent relating to information extraction  har ) creation of variants of known classifiers to enhance their application to business language  har ) possible development of thesaurus-based classifier as an addition to known classifiers  har ) customisation of inputs and outputs to  ame a typical business user ^  um  um . ^ information extraction  har ) simultaneous deployment of multiple extractors ( eg wrapper induction ,  ame , pattern matching , ontology-based techniques )  har ) generation of secondary data to record the certainty of the extraction  har ) generation of tertiary data to enable the subsequent relating to sentiment classification  har ) variation of known extractors to enhance their application to business language  har ) construction of common business concepts and lexicons  har ) customisation of inputs and outputs to  ame a typical business user ^  um  um . ^ enhanced polling  har ) generating a commercially satisfactory correlation between result populations and polling harmony  har ) exploiting the classifier certainty and extractor certainty data derived from (  um ) and (  um ) above  har ) simultaneously delivering dependent and independent results for classifier and extractor polling ^  um  um . ^ machine-learning processes  har ) to increase accuracy  har ) to reduce processor workload  har ) to dynamically grow a library of sentiment and information resources for greater user choice  har ) to support the relating of sentiment classification to information extraction ^  um  um . ^ relating data relating information extraction to sentiment classification in a way which is usable to typical business users :  har ) defining models for this relationship  har ) offering a choice of pre-defined relationship models  har ) possibly permitting user-defined models </text_normal></message_body></message>
