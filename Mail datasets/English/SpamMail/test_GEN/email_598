it is , however , very difficult to find good evaluation functions or rules that work well across domains or in all questions because there are many system parameters that must be carefully tuned in order to achieve good system performance . ^ in consequence , various machine learning ( ml ) techniques have recently been applied to summarization and  ame systems . ^ the purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for exploring the commonality underling this diversity of problem domain and approaches . ^ the workshop has the following goals : ^ - to bring together communities of researchers who apply machine learning techniques to summarization and  ame systems , - to deepen the summarization and  ame community 's understanding of the state of the art in machine learning , - to identify summarization and qa-related problems for which  ame techniques might be appropriate , and - to advance the state of the art of summarization and  ame technologies . ^ topics appropriate to this workshop include : ^ - summarization or  ame systems with  ame techniques , - novel or improved  ame techniques for summarization or  ame , - effective feature extraction methods for characterizing summarization or  ame , - metrics and benchmarks for evaluating the effect of machine learning techniques in summarization or  ame systems , - generation for summarization or  ame , - cross-language or multilingual  ame , - integration with web and  ame access , - corpora creation for summarization or  ame , - interfaces and tools for summarization or  ame . ^ ( ( format for submissions ) ) submissions are limited to original , unpublished work . ^ submissions must  ebsite ( both available from the here workshop web page ) . ^ paper submissions should consist of a full paper (  um words or less , exclusive of title page and references ) . ^ papers outside the specified length are subject to be rejected without review . ^ the paper should be written in english . ^ ( ( submission questions ) ) please send submission questions to  ame  ame (  mail ) . ^ ( ( submission procedure ) ) electronic submission only : send the pdf ( preferred ) , postscript , or  ame  ame form of your submission to :  mail . ^ the subject line should be '  ame workshop paper submission ' . ^ because reviewing is blind , no author information is included as part of the paper . ^ an identification page must be sent in a separate email with the subject line : '  ame workshop  ame page ' and must include title , all authors , theme area , keywords , word count , and an abstract of no more than  um lines . ^ late submissions will not be accepted . ^ notification of receipt will be e-mailed to the first author shortly after receipt . ^ ( ( deadlines ) ) ^ paper submission deadline :  ame  um ,  um ^ notification of acceptance for papers : may  um ,  um ^ camera ready papers due : may  um ,  um ^ workshop date : july  um ,  um ^ ( ( program chairs ) )  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame research center ,  ame  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame /  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame science laboratories ,  ame ^ ( ( program committee ) )  ame  ame  ame university ,  ame  ame chang national  ame university ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame university ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame research center ,  ame  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame of  ame ,  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame /  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame /  ame ,  ame inderjeet  ame  rgre corp.  ame  ame  ame  ame university ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame science laboratories ,  ame  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame research  ame ,  ame  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ( itc)/irst ,  ame  ame  ame  ame university of technology ,  ame  ame  ame  ame of  ame ,  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame university ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame institute of technology ,  ame  ame  ame  ame research ,  ame  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame university of  ame at  ame /  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame university ,  ame  ame  ame  ame university ,  ame  ame  ame state university of  ame  ame ,  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame university ,  ame </text_normal></message_body></message>
