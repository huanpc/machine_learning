ame symposium follows upon the growing awareness from academia , industry , and research communities of the importance of evolvability , tentatively defined as , the capacity of populations to exhibit adaptive heritable  ame partcular , the symposium focuses on the relation between evolvability and sensor and effector evolution . ^ the symposium aims to encourage a dialogue between various workers in areas that might benefit from a possible common framework addressing evolvability and sensor / effector evolution . ^ the symposium addresses  um aspects that are believed to be central in understanding fundamental biological mechanisms , like information information discovery , acquisition , processing and transmission , both on the level of populations and individuals : these mechanisms are evolvability and sensor evolution . ^  ame ^ darwinian evolution characterized by heritable variation and selection is not by itself sufficient to account for the capacity to vary and inherent phenotypic expressions of fitness . ^ rigidity of genotype-phenotype mappings , as often used in evolutionary computation , constrains the dynamics of evolution to a small space of possible biological or artificial systems . ^ open-ended evolution is not possible under such constraints . ^  ame , by itself , cannot fully explain the advant of genetic systems , the flexible genotype-phenotype mappings , heritable fitness . ^ this presents a challenge both to biologists seeking to understand the capacity of life to evolve and to computer scientists who seek to harness biological-like robustness and openness in the evolution of artificial systems . ^ to what extent does evolvability require a population of discrete individuals on which to act ? ^ how can higher levels of sensory individuality arise ? ^  ame has been variously defined as the ' genome 's ability to produce adaptive variants when acted on by the genetic system ' (  ame &  ame ,  um ) , as the ' capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation ' (  ame &  ame ,  um ) ; and as characterized by evolutionary watersheds ' opening the ' floodgates to future evolution ' , such as segmentation and body plans (  ame ,  um ) . ^ on the other hand , unconstrained or inappropriately constrained variability and change can lead to lack of stability , ' cancer ' , nonheritability of fitness , lack of evolutionary power , and so on . ^  ame  ame ^ in natural evolution one finds impressive examples of the principle of exploiting and creating new sensory channels and information they carry . ^  ame , tactile , auditory and visual , but also e.g. electrical and even magnetic senses have evolved in a multitude of variants , often utilizing organs not originally ' intended ' for the purpose they serve at present . ^ biologically evolving systems are able to adaptively construct their own hardware and software . ^ the new sensors create new ways of giving meaning to and interpreting the world . ^ many biological sensors reach a degree of structural and functional complexity and of efficiency which is envied by engineers creating man-made sensors . ^ sensors enable animals to survive in dynamic and unstructured environments , to perceive and react appropriately to features in the biotic and abiotic environment , including members of the own species as well as predators and prey . ^  ame artificial sensors for hardware or software systems suggests a similar approach taken for generating life-like behaviour , namely using evolutionary techniques in order to explore design spaces and generate sensors which are specifically adapted with respect to environmental and other fitness related constraints . ^ the creation of channels of sensory input and effectory output lead to higher evolvability as new relevance criteria are developed that confer a survival advantage to future offspring . ^ call for contributions ^ we solicit abstracts for poster or oral presentation ( appox . ^  um minute talk ) reporting working in this exciting area . ^ talks should address an interdisciplinary audience , but may nevertheless deal with issues at the cutting edge of research . ^ send submissions in plain text (  ame ) format only to  mail . ^ the submission should show author name (  har ) , full addresses , submission title , and an abstract of not more than  um words . ^ submissions should include a statement of the preferred mode of presentation : poster / oral . ^ topic focus on evolvability & sensor evolution ^ suitable topics are or involve ( this is not an exhaustive list ! ) : * evolution of physical sensors * formation of relevance criteria * design concepts for artificial sensors and their evolution , the role of sensors in building complete , autonomous agents and how they interact with the environment * relationship between sensors , perception and actuation * simulated artificial sensors , experiments modeling natural sensor evolution *
