^ there 's not only you and  ame ! ) goes away , their tasks have to be replaced and that will inevitably mean sharing out some of the burden among the rest of us . ^ i am concerned because some people are already working beyond reasonable capacity . ^ this is a real issue as  ame has a history of people being overworked and then off sick . ^ even if we were to get a fractional appt , which is what i will argue for , that still leaves admin tasks to be shared out , because temporary fractional appointments will not be expert admin people ! . ^ they wo n't be likely to be able to carry the kind of burden that more experienced colleagues can . ^ that makes it all the more difficult to alter the  ame role along the lines agreed by all of us . ^ and a fractiuonal appointment is likely to be for less than a semester / year . ^ in your case , i had hoped that you could have taken on rather more in your year tutor role , as 2nd year tutor is one of the admin jobs that hitherto has not been hugely demanding . ^ i was hoping that we could institute a new , better , fairer system for teaching and admin that would give us all research time , including sabbaticals on a rota ( rather than a ' competetive ' basis ) . ^ but getting such a system in place is a team effort and takes time . ^ it 's going to be much harder to do that if people are away . ^ there is also the question of the  ame replacement - applying for sabbatical leave is making a powerful statement about being out of the running for that . ^ i personally would rather the  ame issue were dealt with before sabbaticals were considered . ^ it 's all very complicated , and so i can only say that you should do what you feel you have to do . ^ there 's an inevitable tension between personal interest and team interest , but fortunately it will be up to the  ame committee to decide about research leave , and not up to me . ^ sorry  um cannot be of more concrete help  ame . ^ shell xx ^  ame , i thought you were . ^  rg , i 've been trying to reach you on the phone this am but you are busy , busy , busy . ^ i thought you were meeting with  ame and  ame today to discuss , amongst other things , the sabbatical situation . ^ or is this just in my head ( somehow the 18th has stuck in my brain as an imp . ^ date ) . ^ i really would like to discuss this situation with you . ^ if i want to be able to do this plan in  ame , i will need to set wheels in motion - the logistics are endless . ^ incidentally , i still have not heard back from  ame regarding my original email , though i did write to her to that effect about  um days ago ( message also not acknoweldged ) . ^ though she and  ame both told me i should go for the round of readerships in the university in june , by her not responding to my precise questions surrounding this , i do wonder how much she really is behind me . ^  ame dr.  ame  ame co-director ,  ame for narrative research school of social sciences university of east  ame  ame rd.  ame ,  ame  ame  um email :  mail <text_embedded> ^  ame  ame i am not at uel today . ^ sorry . ^  har . ^ dear  ame , ^ unfortunately , a second presenter ,  ame  ame , has also had to cancel due to illness . ^ there will , therefore , be major changes to the proposed programme . ^  ame  ame ,  ame in politics at  ame university , and i will be taking the place of  ame  ame and  ame  ame . ^ i will compose an email to this effect which i would like to ask you to please send to all the workshop participants , so they will not be surprised by the changes when they arrive on  ame . ^ if you ca n't do this , can you please send me their email addresses and i will contact them directly myself . ^ i will also need to revise some of the materials for the packs . ^ ideally it would be wonderful if you could make copies of the revised materials and give them to  ame ; if you ca n't do this , and i know you are already stretched , please let me know and i will take them to staples here in  ame . ^ i should be able to get them to you by this afternoon (  ame will send me the abstract sometime today ) . ^ thanks for all your help . ^  ame ^  har will dr.  ame  ame co-director ,  ame for narrative research school of social sciences university of east  ame  ame rd.  ame ,  ame  ame  um email :  mail </text_embedded></text_embedded></message_body></message>
