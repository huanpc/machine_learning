^ * semantic indexing and retrieval of documents , combining the strengths of  ame and  ame ; ^ * integration of data about language in language processing components with ontological data ; ^ * robustness across genres and domains ; ^ * ease of embedding in semantic web applications ; ^ * ontology learning , evolving and merging ; ^ * automatic web service description augmentation ; ^ * automatic semantic structure documentation ; ^ * language technology for automatic web service discovery ; ^ * adaptation of generation techniques to  ame applications . ^ the themes of the workshop have partly emerged from the special interest group on language technologies and the semantic web ( sig5 ) , part of the  ame thematic network (  ebsite ^  ame : ^ the issues addressed by the workshop are at the core of the semantic web enterprise . ^ the killer applications that demonstrate the potential of this technology to a mass market have yet to emerge , and will likely not do so until a much larger amount of data is available . ^ the techniques covered by this workshop are one of the most important routes to generating this data . ^ the workshop is relevant to : ^ * researchers from the human language technology areas ; ^ * researchers from the ontology and knowledge acquisition and management areas ; ^ * industrial technology providers involved in knowledge management , information integration , information and library science , web services . ^ organizing committee : ^ dr.  ame  ame -  ebsite  ame  ame -  ebsite dr.  ame  ame -  ebsite ^ may 31st  um deadline for submission of papers june 30th  um notification of acceptance july 15th  um final copy due  um october  um conference ^ the  ame for the workshop will be $  um . ^ participants will be required to register for the main  ame conference . ^  ame : ^ submissions should be sent electronically in  ame format to the organising committee : ^  mail ^ submitted papers should be formatted in the style of the  ame publications format for lecture notes in computer science (  ame ) :  ebsite the emphasis during reviewing will be on content , not format , however . ^  ame committee : ^  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame research center ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame university ,  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , technical university  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , british  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame of  ame ,  ame *  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , open university ,  ame  ame  ame , ontotext lab ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame ,  ame  ame  ame ,  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of economics ,  ame , czech  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame  ame  ame , university of  ame ,  ame ^ * to be confirmed </text_normal></message_body></message>
