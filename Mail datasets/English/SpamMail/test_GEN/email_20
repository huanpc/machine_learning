' ^ so he 'll need to decide whether or not to get rid of parentheticals , and more importantly , whether he 's dousing a light or fire ! ^ interestingly , the definition of extinguish does n't have the or shining ' bit in it . ^ i suspect paraphrasing will only help when the paraphrase is reasonably short . ^ again ,  ame might be in a good position to decide on how short . ^  ame seems to be the opposite of what the summarisation crowd call ' content conflation ' . ^ example from (  ame ,  um ) : ^  ame defeated  ame  um . ^ it was a tight game where the lead kept changing ' can be conflated to generate  ame outlasted  ame  um ' ^ not quite sure how she does that though . ^ definitely not from the cide definition of ' outlast ' . </text_normal></message_body></message>
