 ame  ame  ame language technologies ) which are required by real-world applications . ^ previous workshops on  ame have focused on certain  ame types , notably collocations , terminology and named entities . ^ there are , however , further subtypes of  ame , which are highly relevant for  ame tasks but which have not to date received specific attention . ^  um example are lexicalised ( non- or semi-compositional )  ame which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation . ^ target audience ^ this workshop is intended to bring together  ame researchers working on all areas of  ame . ^ the objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area , to establish common themes between different approaches , and to discuss future trends , with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different  ame ( sub ) types pose for real-world  ame applications . ^ areas of interest ^ papers are invited on , but not limited to , the following topics : ^ * theoretical research on  ame ^ *  ame taxonomies , classifications and databases ^ * corpus based analysis of  ame ^ * cross-lingual analysis of  ame types , use , and behaviour ^ * methods for identification and extraction of  ame ( machine learning , statistical , example- or rule-based , or hybrid ) ^ * evaluation of  ame extraction methods ^ * integration of  ame data into grammars and  ame applications ( e.g. machine translation and generation ) ^ *  ame  ame ( or  ame types ) pose for  ame applications and solutions proposed ^ papers can cover  um or more of these areas . ^ submission information ^ papers should be submitted electronically in postscript or  ame format to :  mail . ^ submissions should conform to the two-column format of  ame proceedings and should not exceed  um (  miley pages , including references . ^ we strongly recommend the use of  rg-2003 style files , also available from the  rg-2003 website . ^ the subject line of the submission email should be '  ame workshop paper submission ' . ^ as reviewing will be blind , the body of the paper should not include the names or affiliations of the authors . ^ the following identification information should be sent in a separate email with the subject line '  ame workshop  ame page ' : ^  ame : title of paper authors : list of all authors  ame : up to  um topic keywords contact author : email address of author of record ( for correspondence )  ame : abstract of paper ( not more than  um lines ) ^ notification of receipt will be emailed to the contact author . ^ important dates ^ submission deadline :  um april  um acceptance notification :  um may  um  ame version deadline :  um may  um workshop date :  um july  um ^ workshop chairs ^  ame  ame  ame  ame science laboratories ,  ame (  mail ) ^  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame (  mail ) ^  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame (  mail ) ^  ame  ame university of  ame ,  ame (  mail ) ^ program committee ^  ame  ame ' (  ame  ame  um ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame university ,  ame )  ame  ame ( university of  ame ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame  ame  ame  ame ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame university ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame university ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame  ame ,  ame )  ame  ame ( vassar college ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame institute of informatics ,  ame )  ame  ame ( austrian research institute for artificial intelligence ,  ame )  ame  ame ( university of  ame ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame  ame  ame  ame ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame  ame space laboratories ,  ame )  ame  ame ( university of  ame ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame university ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame university ,  ame )  ame  ame (  ame ,  ame ) ^ registration ^ workshop registration information will be posted at a later date . ^ the registration  ame will include attendance at the workshop and a copy of workshop proceedings . </text_normal></message_body></message>
