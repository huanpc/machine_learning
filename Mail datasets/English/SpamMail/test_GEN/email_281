' ^ *  ame of the product ( suggest easy on the consultancy . ^ naturally , there will be implementation , best practice assessment etc - which we know will be the cash cow in the short term etc. never mention costs , daily rates should only be discounted under extreme conditions and never mentioned up front ) ^ * simple example ( possibly linked to a  ame  ame ) ^ * detailed textual analysis ^ * which leads to : what are the advantages ? ^ or why should you consider ilexir instead of the competition ? ^ ( best of breed , emphasise university heritage , years of rigorous testing , proven . ^  ame i ca n't tell if  um is good or exceptionally good . ) ^ best , ^  ame . ^  ame /  ame  ame , thanks for making the introduction . ^ as promised , i 'm sending you a bit more draft text that addresses in less technical terms what we are about and what makes the technology unique . ^ when finished this , will be part of the ilexir website . ^ comments very welcome . ^ i 'm also including some urls pointing to the existing non-commercial licence and quick demo for researchers of the system . ^  ame , if you think there is a potential connection / collaboration here , then please do get back to me best , ^  ame  ame ^ (  ame in computational linguistics )  rg university of  ame  ame  ame ave  ame  ame  ame ,  ame email :  mail web page :  ebsite  ame :  um  um  ame :  um  um ^  ebsite  ame  ame provides commercial licensing , support and consultancy for the robust accurate statistical parsing (  ame ) toolkit . ^ the toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification , summarisation , mining and querying . ^ it is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems , which go beyond pure term indexing or domain-specific entity extraction . ^ the  ame toolkit is a package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to , properties predicated of these relations , and relations which hold between them . ^ for instance , the following text sentence-from the transcript of president  ame 's speech at the  ame museum center on 7th october ,  um -- is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath : members of the  ame of both political parties , and members of  rg  rg , agree that  ame  ame is a threat to peace and must disarm . ^ entities : [ member+s of the  ame of both political parties ] [ member+s ] [ the  ame ] [ both political parties ] [ political parties ] [ parties ] [  ame  ame ] [  ame ] [  ame ] [  rg  rg ] [  rg ] [ the  rg ] [ the council ] relations : [ the  ame ] agree+s [ [  ame ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the council ] agree+s [ [  ame ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the  ame ] agree+s [ [  ame ] [ must disarm ] ] [ the council ] agree+s [ [  ame ] [ must disarm ] ] the actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats ( href ) term-based systems represent text documents as ' bags of words ' ( i.e. sets of characters between white spaces ) but will not directly recover the entities referred to in a document , such as '  ame  ame ' , ' political parties ' , '  rg  rg ' or ' members of  ame of both political parties ' . ^ representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides a better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents , such as ' the  ame  ame council ' or ' the  rg ' , and thus also a better way of classifying , summarising or querying document content via salient entities . ^ the  ame system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in a domain-independent way into names ( subdivided into places , people , organisations ) , numbers ( including ranges , dates , etc ) , measure phrases ( ounce , year , etc ) , temporal expressions ( days , weeks , months ) , directions ( north , south , etc ) , and so forth . ^ relational representation of entities provides a natural and effective mechanism for cross-indexing alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations ( href ) . ^ extant systems for extracting entities from text , based on deterministic finite-state pattern matching , rely heavily on manually-supplied domain-specific lexical information from the outset . ^ the relational information recovered by the  ame system can be used to index ' who did what to whom ' and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across a document collection . ^ a relational pattern like ' [ the  ame  ame council ] agree [ ? ] ' ( ' what does the  ame  ame council agree ? ' ) can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise , specific and small amounts of focussed information . ^ this approach to information retrieval deals naturally with non-contiguous text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation ( [ the  rg ] [ the  ame  ame council ] ) as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems , such as negation ( [ the council ] [ not agree ] [ [  ame ] [ must disarm ] ] $ neq $ [ the council ] agree [ [  ame ] [ must disarm ] ] ) . ^ the  ame toolkit achieves about  um accuracy recovering entities and relations from arbitrary english texts , without making use of domain-specific lexical information . ^ it has been used to date to analyse about  um million words of english . ^ a recent paper from a refereed conference proceedings gives more details about each module of the toolkit and compares performance to related systems . ^  ame and performance for specific applications can be considerably improved by semi-automatic customisation on domain and / or application specific text . ^ the toolkit is fully compatible with existing  ame standards for text  ame up and can be used to leverage web sites which will conform with emerging standards for the semantic web (  ame /  ame href ) . ^ a non-exclusive commercial licence to use the  ame toolkit , which includes  um hours support and consultancy to assist with customising and integrating the toolkit into the client 's application , costs $ pounds $  um ,  um . ^ the toolkit is available free for non-commercial use including prototyping and proof-of-concept work in industry . ^ support for this and / or general consultancy on  ame / ir applications and systems is available from  ame ltd at a rate of $ pounds $  um / hour . ^ the cofounders of  ame are  ame  ame and  ame  ame . ^ the  ame toolkit is the product of collaborative research at the university of  ame ,  ame laboratory and university of  ame ,  rg . ^  ame  ame has sole rights to commercial exploitation of the toolkit and works closely with these academic groups to continuously enhance and improve the performance of the toolkit . </text_normal></message_body></message>
