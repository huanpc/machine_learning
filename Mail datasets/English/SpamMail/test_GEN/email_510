^ if you can answer the above , then the editors can make a final decision . ^ note that we expect the same quality standards as for regular submissions to  ame . ^ each accepted paper must have been reviewed by  um independent reviewers . ^ the guest editors make the accept / reject decision but one of the regular  ame editors is assigned to assist in the process ( probably me in this case ) . ^ if you have detailed questions about publication procedures , please contact  ame van der  ame at  ame ( for email see cc list ) . ^  ame </text_normal><text_embedded> ^  ame , ^ i 've been asked to follow-up some previous emails ( copied below ) . ^ in brief ,  ame '  um and  ame  ame  ame  um workshops are seeking a journal special issue . ^ the relevant  ame is attached . ^ in essence we 'd like to repeat the successful previous  ame practice : selected papers for a journal si . ^ last time it was with  ame and this time we 'd like a more speech related one , our first preference being  ame . ^ a key factor is publication date : this should be as soon after  ame date (  ame  um ) as possible . ^ what are your thoughts ?

^ hi  ame ( and  ame ) , ^ thank you for letting me know your thoughts and plans . ^ we are pursuing publication options in parallel and are still very interested in  ame . ^ we look forward to hearing further from  ame after you 've had a chance to talk . ^ would you like any additional information from us ? ^  ame regards ,  ame ^  ame  ame wrote : <text_embedded> ^  ame , i 'm sorry for the delay in response . ^ i 'm actually stepping down from being editor of  ame at the end of june , so i 'm not sure that i should have much of a role in the decision . ^ i 'm cc-ing  ame on this email and will try to talk to him about it in the next couple weeks . ^ we were interested earlier , but we are getting a bit of a backlog , so we need to look at that to assess whether the timing still makes sense . ^  ame ^ hi  ame , ^ i believe that we approached you some time ago to investigate the possibility of a special issue of the computer speech & language journal on  ame  um : the speaker and language recognition workshop ( i 've attached the draft  ame with more details ) . ^ ( given that the  ame  ame '  um workshop will be held in conjunction with  ame '  um , we might want to consider including papers from both workshops in the special issue . ) i recall you being favorable to our query , although we had not yet formulated a real proposal . ^ can you still accommodate us ? ^ if so , under what parameters / conditions ( e.g. , turn around time , page count , page size , guest editor /  har ) ? ^ are you also working under  ame van der  ame and , if so , would you like me to ask her about this ? ^ we published a special issue of  ame journal using an expedited round-robin review process on the  ame speaker  ame  ame  um that was published as almost  um  ame  ame ' pages in a triple volume within only a few months . ^ i think the quality of the papers was reasonably good , although we might have erred on accepting a few too many papers for the special issue and disrupting  ame 's page quotas for that year . ^ there was a special issue of speech communication on an  ame predecessor workshop , but that took much longer ( too long ? ) to publish . ^ i 've included an excerpt from some discussions on these pros and cons and would like to know if you agree with this assessment , especially with respect to  ame . ^ sincerely ,  ame <text_embedded> ^ choices ( in addition that will be e.g. ,  ame , ^ i 'm not for things with this long of a delay . ^ i like moving to journals with reasonable turn around time ( as long as they are not too far from main stream ) . ^  ame  ame seems like a nice one to try . </text_embedded>^  ame  ame  ame , ph.  ame email : j.campbell@ieee.org senior member of technical staff  ame :  um  ame laboratory ,  ame s4-137 ,  ame  um secretary :  um  ame institute of technology  ame :  um information systems technology  ame :  um  um  ame  ame  ame :  ebsite  ame , ma  um  ebsite / classes / notes /  ame / </text_embedded></text_embedded>^  ame  ame  ame , ph.  ame email : j.campbell@ieee.org senior member of technical staff  ame :  um  ame laboratory ,  ame s4-137 ,  ame  um secretary :  um  ame institute of technology  ame :  um information systems technology  ame :  um  um  ame  ame  ame :  ebsite  ame , ma  um  ebsite </text_embedded></message_body></message>
