^ this is a &num 
^ this is a one-time email from &name &name ( &email ) to inform you about the following legal &name perpetrated under the supervision of the attorney general of british &name . 
^ for further information please visit &website . 
^ &char &char &char &char &char &char &char &char &char &char &char ! 
^ attorney general - corruption - &name society - media 
^ the failure of the media has been necessitated the distribution of this public information by email . 
^ the intent is to prevent harm to the public ; therefore , obstructing the distribution of this document is tantamount to causing harm to the public . 
^ at present , a drunk driver is leading the government of british &name . 
^ if the leader of the government has no respect for the &quot;law&quot;, obviously , we may not expect any better performance from his administration . 
^ therefore , we must be vigilant for their actions . 
^ unrestrained public servants are more dangerous offenders than ordinary criminals , because we have no protection against them . 
^ corruption in public service is an organized crime and resisting to organized criminals is not a trivial undertaking for a member of the public . 
^ failure to cooperate with them entails relentless systemic torture inflicted under the colour of law . 
^ as long as the media hide the facts from the public , it is a simple matter to silence the victims by provoking them into violence to justify their arrest or torture to induce suicide . 
^ here is an example : 
^ i started my electrical contract business in &num . 
^ after &num years of successful service , &name &name , permits officer seized and cancelled my contractor-electrician certificate without a complaint , notice and hearing . 
^ he claimed that i was not qualified for my lawfully issued electrician certificate even though i had an accredited electrical engineering degree and &num decades of electrical work experience . 
^ the ministry of attorney general defended &name 's action instead of settling the issue out of the &name . 
^ despite , i had statutory and constitutional rights to a board hearing , and &name &name testified that there was no board hearing , madam &name &name and madam &name &name dismissed my legal action and appeal with costs . 
^ at the trial , &name &name , who was the legal counsel for &name &name , deceived the court by patently stating that i had a hearing . 
^ the executive director of the law society , &name &name failed to investigate her misconduct and compromised the honour and integrity of legal profession . 
^ in addition , as an employee of the ministry of attorney general , &name &name jeopardized the credibility of the ministry . 
^ &name &name was comfortable with her conduct and failed to correct her wrong to protect his peculiar political interests . 
^ i launched an email publicity campaign to display the identity of the perpetrators of this legal scam . 
^ therefore , the police seized my work-van and tools without a warrant ; &name &name was acquiescent to it . 
^ i was unable to work ; the ministry of human resources denied me hardship assistance ( loan ) even though i was qualified . 
^ &name sold my investment property without negotiating the other options of paying my mortgage . 
^ now , &name &name , &name &name 's lawyer collaborating with &name &name of the ministry of attorney general is threatening me with the seizure and forceful sale of my residential property . 
^ they know that i am committed and capable of paying my mortgage upon the resolution of this legal scam . 
^ they are also aware of the fact that it is unlawful for me to consent to the unlawful seizure of my residential property , because it is an encouragement for the criminals to offend the other members of the public . 
^ it is not necessary to have a law degree to conclude that unreasonable seizure of certificate of qualifications , work tools and residential property is unlawful and it may amount to undue torture to induce suicide . 
^ therefore , the chief &name officer of british &name , &name &name may not fool the public by playing ignorance of law , unless he spends a significant amount of public money to cover up his misdeeds and the media continue to support him . 
^ public alert : if &name &name succeeds in covering up this legal &name , you may be the next victim of the same public offenders who i have been torturing me since &num . 
^ ( complete list is at &website ) 
^ please circulate for your own protection .
