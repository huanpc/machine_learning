^ dear qualified buyer , you have exclusive access to this one-time opportunity right now ! 
^ here is your product link : 
^ &website 
^ these are brand new , factory sealed x-boxes . 
^ to get started , you must purchase at least one ' wholesale sources &num - &name ' for $ &num , using the link above . 
^ this e-book contains a list of wholesalers around the world . 
^ you will not be using any of these sources to get your &name . 
^ upon purchasing via the product link above , you will be e-mailed a link , along with a user name and password that you can use to download your e-book . 
^ more info about this e-book can be found at &website . 
^ the actual use of this e-book is optional . 
^ you do n't even need to download it if you do n't want to -- because there is a better incentive for buying this e-book . 
^ for each e-book you purchase , you will gain a free position in the brand new &name &name 'matrix ' ( see below for more information about how a matrix works ) . 
^ this is the only money you will have to spend in order to receive your &name &name ( es ) . 
^ furthermore , there is no limit to the amount of e-books you can buy - this means that you can get as many &name as you like for $ &num each ! 
^ you can pay for your order with any major credit card . 
^ buying more than &num e-book at a time will result in your name appearing that many times on the matrix list . 
^ how a matrix works : a matrix consists of a list of people who want cheap electronics . 
^ the first person to sign up is at the top of the list , and the last person to sign up is at the bottom . 
^ for every &num people that sign up with the matrix , the person on the top gets ' cycled out ' and receives his / her brand new &name &name ! 
^ the person that was second on the list then moves up to the top position and the matrix continues . 
^ obviously , the key in getting your free stuff in a timely manner is to be near the top of the matrix . 
^ this can be achieved by merely waiting for other people to sign up after you . 
^ alternatively , the process is accelerated with advertising ( telling your friends and family , advertising on web sites , posting on forums , e-mailing ) . 
^ it 's important to sign up now while the lists are still small ( ( &num people ) . 
^ currently , the approximate waiting time is estimated at &num weeks - &num months . 
^ what 's that mean ? 
^ put up $ &num now and get &num &name &name 's in less than &num months ! 
^ once you 've signed up , check in periodically to see your position on the &name &name matrix by going to the web address above . 
^ when you get cycled , you get your &name &name ! 
^ a representative will contact you ( using the information you provided when purchasing ) as soon as this event occurs ( in case you do n't check every day ) . 
^ the matrix lists are usually updated within &num hrs of your purchase , but sometimes it can be longer . 
^ if you 've made a purchase and do n't see your name on the matrix &name later , you can write an e-mail to &email . 
^ the best advice i can give at this point is to buy as many e-books as you can while the lists are so short ! 
^ you 'll appreciate it when &num or &num brand new &name &name arrive on your doorstep each of these has an approximate &name value of $ &num ! 
^ that 's a &num return on your money ! 
^ remember -- buy while the lists are still short . 
^ if you check out the website &website . 
^ &name to see your name on the matrix soon ! ! ! ! 
^ regards ,
