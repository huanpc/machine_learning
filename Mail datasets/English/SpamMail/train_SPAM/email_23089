^ this means you must keep all of your preparations secret . 
^ do n't let anyone at work know that you are updating your resume or gathering papers for a portfolio -- it could put your job in jeopardy . 
^ instead , try to keep up the appearance of ' business as usual . ' 
^ this includes : do not provide your workplace phone number to networking contacts and do not use the office copier to make copies of your resume . 
^ and if a coworker starts to talk to you about the possibility of getting laid off , try to change the subject .
