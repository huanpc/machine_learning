^ dear sir , 
^ the 8th all &name games . 
^ i am dr. &name &name , the chief accountant of the federal ministry of youth , sport , and culture parent body of the local &name committee of the 8th all african game tagged [ &name ] &num taking place in my country in &num , . 
^ in the course of our preparation to host the 8th all african games , huge sum of money running into millions of united states dollars was budgeted by the present civilian administration of our president chief &name &name for the successful organization of this competition . 
^ in the same vein , the supreme council for sport in &name made millions of dollars available for the same competition . 
^ however , in my capacity as the chief &name , to both local organizing committee ( &name ) , and the federal ministry of youth , sports and culture , i and some of my colleagues in sensitive positions were able to influence the award of a contract for the supply and installation of some of the facilities that will be used for the competition . 
^ the contractor who handled these projects agreed to give my colleagues and &char &num of the total contract sum , if we were able to influence the award of the contract to their favour . 
^ so many foreign firms bided for this same contract , but because we knew whom we wanted the contract to be awarded to , we made sure that the contractor we had this understanding with won the contract . 
^ they have been paid &num of their total contract sum remaining the balance of &num which we never wanted them to collect on our behalf because of the fear that they might not give us the balance of &num . 
^ it is pertinent to note that , the remaining balance of a total sum of &num million united states ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) is lying in the suspense account at first chartered &name &name , ready for transfer into any good bank account of your choice . 
^ i have been unanimously mandated to seek for an honest and trustworthy foreign partner who will assist in ensuring the successful transfer of the above sum of money into his personal / company account since the nigerian code of conduct bureau does not permit us to operate a foreign account as public servants . 
^ on the successful remittance of the fund ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) into your nominated account , for your kind assistance you will be adequately compensated . 
^ be rest assured that , the modalities and logistics towards the successful transfer of this fund has been worked out .

^ we kindly request that you accord to it the highest level of secrecy it deserves . 
^ your swift response will be highly appreciated and kindly provide your phone and fax number for more informative discussions . 
^ upon your acknowledgement of this proposal , i will forward to you the detailed procedure for this transaction . 
^ note that , this transaction is legal and free from all sorts of risk and trouble . 
^ it does not contravene the laws of my country nor any international laws ; hence the whole approval for the transfer will be official and legally processed . 
^ this transaction will be concluded within &num ( &num ) working days if we follow it up and give the serious attention it deserves . 
^ awaiting your prompt response .
