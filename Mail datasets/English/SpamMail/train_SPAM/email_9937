^ dear sir , 
^ request for urgent business relationship - strictly 
^ confidential . 
^ firstly , i must solicit your strictest confidentiality 
^ in this transaction . 
^ this is by virtue of its nature 
^ as being utterly confidential and ' &name secret . ' though 
^ i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make 
^ anyone apprehensive and worried , but i am assuring you 
^ that all will be well at the end of the day . 
^ we have 
^ decided to contact you first by your email due to the 
^ urgency of this transaction , as we have been reliably 
^ informed that it will take at least &num to &num weeks 
^ for a normal post to reach you . 
^ so we decided it is 
^ best using the email . 
^ let me start by first introducing myself properly to 
^ you . 
^ i am chief . 
^ &name &name , a senior official in the 
^ nigerian national petroluem corporation and i head a three-man tender board in charge of &name awards and payment 
^ approvals . 
^ i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business 
^ transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence . 
^ &char and my 
^ colleagues are top officials of the federal government contract review panel . 
^ our duties include evaluation , vetting , approval 
^ for payment of contract jobs done for the &name , etc. in order to commence this business , we solicit for your assistance to 
^ enable us transfer into your account the said funds . 
^ the source of this funds is as follows : during the 
^ last military regime here in &name , this committee 
^ awarded a contract of us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num hundred 
^ million united states dollars ) to &num construction 
^ firms on behalf of the petroleum ministry for the 
^ supply , construction and installation of oil pipeline 
^ from warri to &name . 
^ during this process my 
^ colleagues and i decided amongst ourselves to 
^ deliberately over-inflate the total contract sum to 
^ us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num hundred and &num &num million 
^ &num hundred thousand united states dollars ) with the 
^ main intention of sharing the remaining sum of 
^ us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num &num million &num hundred 
^ thousand united states dollars ) amongst ourselves . 
^ the 
^ federal government of &name has since approved the 
^ sum of us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num hundred and &num one 
^ million , &num hundred thousand united states dollars ) 
^ for us as the contract sum , and the sum of 
^ us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num hundred million united states 
^ dollars ) has also been paid to the foreign contractors 
^ concerned as contract entitlements for the contract 
^ done , but since each of the companies is entitled to 
^ us $ &num , &num , &num only , we are now left with 
^ us $ &num , &num , &num balance in the account which we 
^ intend to transfer abroad into a safe and reliable 
^ account to be disbursed amongst ourselves , but by 
^ virtue of our positions as civil servants and members 
^ of this panel , we cannot do this by ourselves , as we 
^ are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil 
^ service laws ) from opening / operating foreign 
^ accounts in our names , making it impossible for us to 
^ acquire the money in our names . 
^ i have , therefore , 
^ been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in 
^ the panel to look for an overseas partner into whose 
^ account we would transfer the sum of us $ &num , &num , &name 
^ ( &num &num million &num hundred thousand united 
^ states dollars ) , hence we are writing you this letter . 
^ my colleagues and i have agreed that if your company 
^ can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our 
^ behalf , you or your company will retain &num of the 
^ total amount of us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num &num million 
^ &num hundred thousand united states dollars ) , while 
^ &num will be for us ( members of this panel ) and the 
^ remaining &num will be used in offsetting all 
^ debts / expenses incurred ( both local and foreign ) in 
^ the cause of this transfer . 
^ needless to say , the trust 
^ reposed on you at this juncture is enormous . 
^ in return 
^ we demand your complete honesty and trust . 
^ you must 
^ however , note that this transaction will be strictly 
^ based on the following terms and conditions as we have 
^ stated below , as we have heard confirmed cases of 
^ business associates running away with funds kept in 
^ their custody when it finally arrive their accounts . 
^ a 
^ very good and recent example is the &num of mr. peter 
^ &name , the president of &name trading and 
^ &name company at &name &num , &name 55th street , 
^ 21st floor , &name &name &num , and former chairman of 
^ &name ( mr. &name &name ) , who we were reliably 
^ informed that after the agreement between both 
^ partners in which he was to take &num of the money , 
^ while the remaining &num for nigerian officials . 
^ with 
^ all the required documents signed , the money was duly 
^ transferred into his account , only to be disappointed 
^ on their arrival in &name &name and were informed that 
^ mr. &name &name was no longer on that address , while 
^ his telephone and fax numbers have been re-allocated 
^ to somebody else . 
^ this was how they lost us $ 18.5 
^ million to mr. &name . 
^ this is a very recent story 
^ here in my country and everybody is aware of this , 
^ some of the officials decided to cry out and face the 
^ law , because they felt they had lost too much to a 
^ stranger , while the chairman of &name ( mr. patrick 
^ &name ) is hiding in a foreign country . 
^ so right now we 
^ are taking all precautionary measures to guard against 
^ re-occurrence of such act in our case . 
^ this is why we 
^ have decided that this transaction will be based 
^ completely on the following : 
^ ( &char ) . 
^ our conviction of your transparent honesty and 
^ diligence . 
^ ( &char ) . 
^ that you would treat this transaction with 
^ utmost secrecy and confidentiality . 
^ ( &char ) . 
^ that upon receipt of the funds , you will 
^ promptly release our share ( &num ) on demand after you 
^ have removed your &num and all expenses have been 
^ settled . 
^ ( &char ) . 
^ you must be ready to produce us with enough 
^ information about yourself to put our minds at rest . 
^ please , note that this transaction is &num legal and 
^ risk free and we hope to conclude the business in 
^ &name &name working days from the date of receipt of 
^ the necessary information and requirement from you . 
^ please , acknowledge the receipt of this letter using 
^ my email address . 
^ i will bring you into the complete 
^ picture of the transaction when i have heard from you . 
^ your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we 
^ are already behind schedule for this financial 
^ quarter . 
^ thank you and &name bless . 
^ yours faithfully , 
^ chief &name uju 
^ faites un voeu et puis !
