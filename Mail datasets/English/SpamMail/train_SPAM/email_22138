^ seeking your immediate assistance . 
^ please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner . 
^ this is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy foreign partner . 
^ this request may seem strange and unsolicited but i crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously . 
^ my name is &name . 
^ &name &name of the democratic &name of &name and &num of the close aides to the former president of the democratic &name of &name laurent &name of blessed memory , may his soul rest in peace . 
^ due to the military campaign of laurent &name to force out the rebels in my country , i and some of my colleagues were instructed by late president &name to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of &num million , &num hundred thousand united states dollars only ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) to fight the rebel group . 
^ we were then given this money privately by the then president , laurent &name , without the knowledge of other cabinet members . 
^ but when president &name was killed in a bloody shoot-out by &num of his bodyguards a day before we were schedule to travel out of &name , we immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here in &name for safe keeping . 
^ the security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of col. &name &name ( &num of the aides to &name &name ) a tribesman , and some other military personnel from our same tribe , by the new president of the democratic &name of &name , the son of late president &name &name , &name &name .

^ this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is marked ' ' confidential '' and it will not pass through normal custom / airport screening and clearance . 
^ our inability to move this money out of &name all this while stems from our lack of trust of our supposed good friends ( western countries ) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late president &name , immediately after his son took office . 
^ though we have neither seen nor met each other , the information we gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance , this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within &num weeks . 
^ the said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality .
