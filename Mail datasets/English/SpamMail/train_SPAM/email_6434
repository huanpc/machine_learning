^ so here is the new sunpoll : 
^ is server consolidation becoming a priority ?

^ &num tech briefing : 
^ * ' &name ' &name now denies domain &name 
^ just as a heads-up , i 'm relaying a bit from an email a w2knews subscriber just sent me this week . 
^ it shows you need to test , test , test any hotfix that you get alerted about . 
^ here 's the ugly detail : ' windows just made me install some ' critical ' updates , after which i could no reboot ' 
^ the patch ( security bulletin ms03-007 ) , is incompatible with &num software fixes for &name issued by &name 's product support services ( &name ) between december &num and &name &num . 
^ users running any of those fixes wo n't be able to reboot their &name machines after applying the ' critical ' patch , according to a revised version of &name 's bulletin issued tuesday . 
^ if you run &name &name , verify the version of a file called ' &char &char &char &char &char &char &char &char . 
^ &char &char &char ' on your system before applying the patch . 
^ versions of this file from &num up to and including &num were distributed by &name and are not compatible with the patch . 
^ if you have an incompatible file on your system , contact &name &name before applying the patch . 
^ if the patch is installed on a system with the incompatible file , the machine will fail on the first reboot and will have to be recovered using the &name recovery console . 
^ * first take on &name &name systems initiative ( &name ) 
^ the analystviews site has a good article about &name ' new future vision to make your applications ' operationally aware ' . 
^ in describing this real-time infrastructure , &name joins &name , &name and sun that have similar initiatives . 
^ it starts out like this . 
^ link to full article at the end . 
^ ' on &num march &num , &name announced its dynamic systems initiative ( &name ) , a real-time infrastructure strategy to improve simplicity , automation and flexibility in &name environments . 
^ &name differentiates its vision with a focus on &name developers . 
^ in &name , improving the dynamic , self-management characteristics of a service comes from designing , developing and deploying applications with operations , manageability , service definitions and topologies , security policies , and service- level characteristics kept in mind throughout the process . 
^ &name calls this design schema the system definition model ( &name ) . 
^ in addition , &name shifts the focus on windows from &char ' &num application / &num operating system / &num server ' mentality toward virtualization characterized by mixed workloads within a single operating-system image , dynamic hard partitions , virtual machines , virtual storage , metadirectory services for virtual identity management and rapid image deployment . 
^ in &name &name &num , &name will deliver the windows system resource manager , an effective tool for managing resources between &num applications ( but it does n't eliminate the application collision issue ) . 
^ &name will also deliver &name &name services a tool to rapidly install images in a large number of servers ( like blades ) and make them operational and virtual storage enhancements .

^ * fix a &name ' &name ' 
^ &name technology has improved considerably over the years . 
^ the downside is that even though the newer versions are backward compatible with pre-existing &num , there are some things that older operating systems cannot do with the newer versions . 
^ you might wind up doing some major damage to your security setup , &name or permissions unless you take this into consideration . 
^ good lil ' tip at the &name site : &website 
^ &num &name / &num related news : 
^ * no &name for &name to &name &name &name 
^ &name just this wednesday warned everyone about an important new hole involving the remote procedure call ( &name ) protocol in &name , &name and &name . 
^ the hole can allow a denial-of-service attack , and is &name # &num this year . 
^ and here comes the ' interesting ' bit . 
^ they made a patch available for &name and &name , but not for &name . 
^ they claimed ' architectural issues ' and instead , provided a workaround . 
^ hmmmm. this causes one to pause for a moment and ask oneself , is this the so called 'shot before the bow ' ? 
^ ( a warning originating from naval warfare that worse is going to come if you do not change course or comply ) . 
^ could &name be reminding us in a not-so-gentle way we need to upgrade to &name , or &name that has just gone gold and was sent to mass manufacturing ? 
^ i have included a link to the bulletin below . 
^ they said servers on an intranet were the most likely to be vulnerable to the attack . 
^ &name further said that responsible network security practices should prevent the vulnerability from being open on &name servers . 
^ ' best practices recommend blocking all &name / &name ports that are not actually being used , ' they said . 
^ ' for this reason , most machines attached to the &name should have port &num blocked . 
^ &name over &name is not intended to be used in hostile environments such as the &name . ' here is the link : &website 
^ * &name &name &name lawsuits for security breaches 
^ &name &name digest is an e-mail newsletter by information security magazine . 
^ they came out with an article that i thought you should share with your managers in the it department . 
^ i 'm quoting a short bit here : 
^ ' legal experts say a spattering of downstream liability lawsuits are setting the stage for a wave of cyberattack victims trying to recoup their losses through litigation . 
^ few victims have brought legal action against companies that facilitate --wittingly or not-- worm outbreaks , distributed denial 
^ - of-service ( &name ) attacks or security breaches . 
^ however , attorney &name &name says such cases are harbingers for a new class of lawsuits that will seek court remedies for it security problems . 
^ as regulations , such as the financial industry 's &name act ( &name ) and health care 's health &name &name and &name act ( &name ) go into effect , the requirement to have adequate security could open some currently unregulated industries to lawsuits . 
^ ' once those duties come into effect , there will be lawsuits , ' says &name , an attorney with &name , &name and &name in &name d.c. 
^ observers say lawsuits will escalate in scope as victims seek compensation from enterprises used as middlemen in attacks , &name that do n't ensure their users ' security and software vendors that market insecure applications . 
^ finding a liable party may not make a difference , &name says . 
^ if a victim can identify a few dozen potential contributors to its security breach , it could file lawsuits against all and exact settlements based on the negative publicity . 
^ ' we 'll likely see an increase in court mediation given the expanding pools of victims and the unwillingness of government to pass laws or regulations , ' says &name &name , a &name and research director at &name group .
