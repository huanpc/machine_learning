^ rpm technologies , inc. , otc-bb : &name has taken advantage of current market conditions and created a company that has developed a proprietary processing system of producing stronger , more durable , and more cost-effective plastic pa !

^ the pallet market is shifting from wood to plastic at the rate of &num to &num per year and accelerating . 
^ in &num years the market will be about &num / &num wood to plastic . 
^ &name is positioned to capture a huge portion of this transition . 
^ fueling this transition to plastic was a march &num edict by &num countries banning the use of soft wood ! 
^ for shipping and packaging .

^ exporters are clamoring for alternatives - and plastic pallet sales are exploding .

^ &char plastic pallet costing $ &num will endure &num trips , or 16&cent; per trip . 
^ &char wood pallet costing $ &num , enduring about &num trips , costs $ &num per trip . 
^ shippers using loop-systems ( round-trips ) save a ton of money by using plastic ! 
^ woo ! 
^ &char pallets weigh &num to &num pounds each , versus &num pounds for &name plastic pallets . 
^ savings in freight bills to the shipper can amount to thousands of dollars per year . 
^ &name sales are developed through a growing roster of wood and plastic pallet distributors , strategically located throughout the &name , &name and &name , where &name has sold its pallets to many &name &num companies . 
^ orders are currently being shipped to &name &name , &name and the middle east - opening up world markets .

^ kman 's comp claims , smaller workman 's comp premiums . 
^ another plus for plastic !
