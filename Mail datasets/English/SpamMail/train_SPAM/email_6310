^ ' the individual soup ( &name &name &name ) is soooo good .

^ &name just some questions to consider i realize that it 's hard to feel funny these days - i go home , turn on the tv and watch &name . 
^ but still - they say that laughter is good for you - something in which i truly believe - so i figure 
^ - let 's all take a short break - and enjoy thinking about things that , well , probably do n't deserve a whole lot of thought ! 
^ &num . 
^ why is an alarm clock going ' off ' when it actually turns on ? 
^ &name bag chef 's - &name , &name , &name ! 
^ i 'm definitely an impulse buyer - and when i saw these adorable bag ' chef 's' - i absolutely had to have one for my house - and for my daughter-in-law too . 
^ then i figured - hey - maybe you guys would like some . 
^ the idea is very simple - they have a hole in the back of their pants , and another one at their feet . 
^ you put your plastic bag collection in the top - and pull the bags out &num at a time as you need them . 
^ but a solution to the problem of plastic bag storage is not what made me buy them . 
^ ( well , not entirely ) the whole truth is - they are cute beyond words ! 
^ each 'doll ' has hair , a chef 's outfit , and typical kitchen equipment . 
^ the &name &name is carrying a tray of sushi , the italian chef has a spaghetti fork , and &name , the pastry chef , is holding a baked cherry pie . 
^ you absolutely have to check them price is over $ &num each ( i checked the web - some sites sell similar things for up to $ &num ) - but i 'm them at just $ &num . 
^ now the only decision i need to make - which one do i get from my daughter at university - the pastry chef or the &name &name ? 
^ 'so far , we have tried the cheese vegetable and the chicken &name , and they are by far the best soup mixes we have ever used . 
^ by the way , your ' instant ' chicken noodle soup is wonderful , really great for the lunches i pack for work for my husband and myself ! ' deb &name , &name 
^ &num . 
^ if love is blind , how can we believe in love at first sight ? 
^ d. &name &name &name &name &name ' the chicken &name single serving pac that came with my order was most surprising . 
^ it has to be the best instant meal i ever fixed for lunch at work in the microwave . 
^ who would have guessed that much soup and noodles could fix in such a small space . 
^ so far with &num down and &num to go - i have not found &num soup in my order that not great . 
^ &name &name , &name 
^ if you 've ordered recently ( or even not so recently ) , you 've gotten one of our great tasting instant soups in your box . 
^ but did you know that there are huge savings if you buy them in bulk ? 
^ is &num cents each , if you get &num or more - the price drops to &num cents each . 
^ but buy &num and the price is just &num cents each . 
^ that 's lunch for &num months for under $ &num ( including shipping ! ) 
^ &website 
^ &num . 
^ why is the alphabet song and twinkle twinkle little star the same tune ? 
^ &name &name &name - the ultimate sweet ! 
^ it 's time for the annual &name &name &name off party - and my annual &name off newsletter . 
^ &name insisted on this edition - said it just would n't be spring with this traditional ode to weather ( and sap ) 
^ &num . 
^ why do toasters always have a setting that burns the toast to a horrible crisp which no decent human being would eat ? 
^ the &name &name off party keeping in mind that &name makes about &num of the world 's &name &name , you must forgive us for thinking that the best ( and really the only ) source for maple syrup is our back yards . 
^ that 's right - our back yards . 
^ not my back yard of course - i live in the city . 
^ but just a short drive off of the island of &name reveals acre upon acre of &name &name - now all decked out for the season with their taps and buckets . 
^ and then there are the sugar shacks - operative word - shack . 
^ and judging by the conditions of the walls and floors - these shacks date from the turn of the century - and not &num either ! 
^ but never mind - you do n't go for the scenery - you go for the food . 
^ and along with the food comes gallons and gallons of &num % &name &name . 
^ the meal starts slowly - first there 's the highly traditional french canadian pea soup - served with bacon and maple syrup . 
^ second course - &name au lard , &name &name lard , &name , and coleslaw ! 
^ in english -that 's baked beans ( with &name &name ) , thick slabs of bacon so crisp they stand on end ( cooked in &name &name ) , and slices of &name ( roasted with you know what ! ) . 
^ then there 's &name ( meat pie ) - also made with &name &name . 
^ they clear the dishes - and bring out the third course . 
^ omelets so big kids could get lost in them - piled high with boiled potatoes ( add your own &name &name ) , and pancakes ( pass the syrup ) . 
^ finally - time for dessert ( excuse me - and just what was all that syrup ? ) . 
^ there 's apple cake made with - you guessed it - apples and maple syrup , and eggs serves in a dish filled with maple syrup . 
^ sounds yucky , looks worse - but tastes great ! 
^ then it 's time for the tir - or pull . 
^ basically you pour hot maple syrup on snow - as it cools it also hardens - and you can roll it up on a stick . 
^ the original lollipop - lick , lick , lick - and enjoy . 
^ when all the eating is done - it 's time for the music . 
^ traditionally played on guitar and wooden spoons , &name music is loud , rhythmic - and addictive . 
^ &name way to exercise off those excessive calories . 
^ some &name actually eat this meal every day for the entire &num weeks season - i stick to just once - but i start looking forward to it at the beginning of march - and by the time it 's the end of march - it 's like waiting for christmas ( only sweeter ! ) 
^ &num . 
^ why is it that rain drops but &name falls ? 
^ &num % natural - &num &name - &num &name &name &name is still made in the old fashioned way - the sap is collected , and then boiled , and boiled , and boiled since it takes &num gallons of sap to make just &num gallon of syrup . 
^ and by canadian law , nothing can be added - canadian &name &name is &num the real thing . 
^ what makes it so interesting is the variety of product you can get just by boiling and whipping tree sap . 
^ there 's not just maple syrup , but there 's also maple sugar candies , and my personal passion - &name &name . 
^ so do your sweet tooth a favor - treat it to the ultimate taste of &name - &name &name . 
^ and in honor of the season - &num off this month . 
^ we have jugs ranging from the tiny ( but totally cute ) &num ml size up to &num fl &name jugs ( a full cup ) . 
^ for most families - &num fl &name is enough for at least &num months - just store it in the fridge . 
^ our maple candies are &num maple sugar - soft and sooooo sweet . 
^ and of course our &name &name is a treat and a half . 
^ spread it on toast for a unique taste , or melt it on potatoes or veggies . 
^ there is simply nothing better . 
^ and do n't be fooled by knock offs - table syrup , &name &name , and even &name &name &name just is n't the same thing .

^ if the professor on &name 's island can make a radio out of a coconut , why ca n't he fix a hole in a boat ?

^ - pour &name &name into your coffee instead of sugar . 
^ or make it even fancier with the addition of heavy cream and vanilla . 
^ delightful way to end a festive spring meal . 
^ &num if you throw a cat out a car window , does it become &name litter ? 
^ &name glazed back &name ( or &name ) dinner oh dear - this has to be the ultimate of sinful - but hey , sugar season lasts for such a short time - why not live it up ?

^ why do ' fat-chance ' and 'slim-chance ' mean the same thing ? 
^ &name baked turnips i figure this balances out the last recipe . 
^ and anything that makes turnips taste better has to be a winner ! 
^ &name wants to add in that she personally loves turnips - so in her opinion - this recipe wins on &num counts . 
^ why not try it out on your family ( i suggest that you not admit it has turnips till after they have finished eating . )
