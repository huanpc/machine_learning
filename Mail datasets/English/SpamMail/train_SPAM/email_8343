^ &name &name &num 
^ dear sir , 
^ i am mr. &name &name , an official with &num of the apex banks in &name colleagues and i have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you . 
^ on the 6th of june &num an american miner , mr. &name &name ran an account with us and his present balance is valued at us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num million , &num hundred thousand united states dollars only ) in my bank . 
^ we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . 
^ after a month , we sent a reminder and finally , we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident . 
^ on further investigation , we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless , as he had none . 
^ we therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr. &name &name did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files . 
^ this sum of $ &num , &num , &num is still lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year . 
^ as it is now , no one will ever come forward to claim this money . 
^ according to the &name law , at the expiration of &num ( &num ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the government if unclaimed . 
^ consequently , my proposal is that i would like you to stand in as the next of kin of mr. &name &name . 
^ this is simple ; all we need is some of your details so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would put you in place as mr. &name 's next of kin . 
^ we shall also employ the services of an accredited attorney for the drafting and notarisation of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate / administration in your favour for the transfer . 
^ the money would be shared in the ration of &num for us and &num for you . 
^ there is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as a manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . 
^ if you are interested , please reply immediately via email . 
^ please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us . 
^ i shall still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help , otherwise we 'll take our share . 
^ awaiting your urgent reply . 
^ mr. &name &name &num
