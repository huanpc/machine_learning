^ subject : fwd : a guy 's opinion 
^ the unusual disclaimer that follows the message is also quite amusing ... 
^ driving to the office this morning on the interstate &num , i looked over to my left and there was a woman in a brand new mustang doing &num miles per hour with her face up next to her rear view mirror putting on her eyeliner . 
^ i looked away for a couple seconds and when i looked back she was halfway over in my lane , still working on that makeup . 
^ as a man , i do n't scare easily , but she scared me . 
^ i dropped my electric shaver , which knocked the donut out of my other hand . 
^ in all the confusion of trying to straighten out the car using my knees against the steering wheel , it knocked my cell phone away from my ear which fell into the coffee between my legs , splashed and burned &name &name and the twins , ruined the phone and disconnected an important call . 
^ i wish they 'd keep women off the roads !
