^ &name : 
^ the &name association is now using a system to track alumni involvement with the university . 
^ this system is based on awarding points to alumni according to their level of involvement . 
^ i have attached information about this system which the other faculties are participating in. &num would appreciate if you would review the following information inform our office of any alumni involvement you or your office has according to the points system criteria . 
^ we will then feed the information to the &name association . 
^ i am assuming our office will have most of this information but events contacts are made outside of &name relations office activities if you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact me . 
^ the benefit to participating in this venture is that we can then measure the quality of alumni involvement . 
^ thank you .

^ &name association ( ? 
^ xml : namespace prefix &char ns ' urn : schemas-microsoft-com : office : office ' / ) 
^ &name &name : &name &name &name 
^ &name : june &num , &num 
^ &name participation in planned events , university association governance activities can be quantified in a useful way . 
^ by measuring individual involvement providing a list of participant 's names , both the &name association the university will benefit . 
^ based on a program developed by the university of the association has devised the following alumni involvement rating scale . 
^ each time an alumnus participates in any way in affairs , he or she is given a numerical value ( aka points ) . 
^ the number of points ascribed to any given event or activity is based on the importance of the event , its significance to the university , the level of commitment shown by the graduate . 
^ point values can be determined by the association the university , but should reflect the value of the activity . 
^ for instance : 
^ &num point:- &name supplies record update . 
^ &num points- &name responds to ' class &name ' or other where-are-they-now form in &name , newsletters or class mailings . 
^ &name copy of &name &name 
^ &name &name program information 
^ &name contact information on other alumni 
^ submits a published book for &name review 
^ &name attends a meeting , branch event , event , etc. 
^ participates in the marketing program ie. purchases a product or goes on an alumni trip . 
^ signs on to the &name &name community 
^ &num points : &name subscribes to trek magazine or &name involved in career networking 
^ is involved in activities 
^ &name attends a class reunion 
^ submits an award nomination 
^ &name donates memorabilia 
^ &num points : &name volunteers for an &name association or &name as a mentor 
^ purchases an &name 
^ makes unsolicited donation to the association 
^ &num points : significant involvement of time : ie. reunion chair , leadership in regional networks , committees , etc , 
^ &name represents the association at an event . 
^ former board / past president activities 
^ &num points : members of the board of directors , board of governors , member of &name , chancellor 
^ points can be accumulated , so that &num person can earn many points . 
^ for instance : a member of the board of directors who works as the chair of a committee attends &num meetings of that committee over the course of a year , attends a reunion , brings ' association greetings ' to an award presentation , buys an &name acts as a mentor , would accumulate &num points over &num year . 
^ total points are tabulated throughout the year . 
^ at the end of the year , a report is produced that would show number of points earned as an individual , as a total numbers of alumni points by category . 
^ the report might look something like this : 
^ &num / &num &num / &num 
^ no involvement &num , &num &num , &num 
^ &num point &num , &num &num , &num 
^ &num points &num , &num &num , &num 
^ &num points &num , &num &num , &num 
^ &num points &num , &num &num , &num 
^ &num points &num &num 
^ &num points &num &num 
^ &num points &num &num 
^ &num + points &num &num 
^ &num + points &num &num 
^ points start from &num at the beginning of each fiscal year , so that growth in involvement can be presented programs that encourage alumni involvement can be more easily benchmarked . 
^ the names of graduates who earned points over the year will be available to the development office for fundraising purposes to the university community for cultivation purposes . 
^ this method of measuring alumni involvement will be tracked using the viking system . 
^ there are some measurements of alumni affinity that cannot be ascribed to an individual but we feel are indicative of attachment to an &name mater will therefore be included as a separate number . 
^ these include : 
^ number of alumni who vote in a university or association election 
^ number of alumni who participate in a partnership program ( ie. &name , &name etc. ) 
^ practical application - ' pointing ' in the right direction 
^ alumni have been asked to provide their alumni lists in an excel template on a monthly basis via email to &name &name 
^ the &name association will assign points upload the information onto viking on a monthly basis . 
^ affinity reports are generated on a quarterly basis circulated . 
^ for any questions please contact :
