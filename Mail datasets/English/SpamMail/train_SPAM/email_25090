^ is the speed , performance and reliability of your system being degraded by fragmentation ? 
^ if you are not using diskeeper&reg; automatic disk defragmenter for windows&reg; on all servers and workstations on your system , fragmentation and the problems it causes are creating non-optimum conditions for both systems administrators and users , to say nothing of the poor help desk staff . 
^ you 've purchased diskeeper in the past&# 151;and we thank you for helping make it the best-selling disk defragmenter on the market today . 
^ but do you have diskeeper deployed throughout your entire site on every workstation and server ? 
^ if not , you can be sure that unchecked fragmentation is slowing performance and productivity to some degree . 
^ &name testing shows that defragmentation improves speed and performance up to &num . 
^ it has also been found that fragmentation is directly related to a number of system reliability and stability issues including : slow boot times and computers that wo n't boot up slow backup time and aborted backup file corruption and data loss crashes and system hangs / freezes errors in programs &name use and cache problems hard drive failures 
^ there are those who mistakenly think that the defragmentation utility built in to windows operating systems is an acceptable solution to fragmentation issues . 
^ it is not ! 
^ for &num thing , the fact that it cannot be automatically scheduled means that it is usually forgotten about until well after system performance has declined significantly . 
^ independent studies show that diskeeper not only performs up to &num faster than the built-in but does a much more thorough job of defragmentation . 
^ if you want your system to be maintained optimally , you need an easy to use , fast , thorough , automatic defragmenter , which runs in the background and uses minimal system resources . 
^ in other words you need diskeeper running on every server and workstation on your system . 
^ to find out what it will take to do this , call you reseller or an executive software sales representative at &num ext . 
^ &num . 
^ do n't hesitate ! 
^ every day you delay means more helpdesk calls , more fragmentation , more system issues and downtime .
