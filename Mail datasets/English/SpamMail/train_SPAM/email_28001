^ start networking 
^ it 's always a good idea to maintain a strong career network . 
^ you never know when those connections may come in useful . 
^ if you suspect that layoffs are around the corner , now is the perfect time to reconnect with those contacts you have n't spoken to in a while . 
^ begin by updating your network . 
^ get the latest phone numbers and e-mail addresses of people you 've lost touch with . 
^ then call or write these contacts and chat a bit . 
^ do n't come right out and ask for a job ( save that conversation for later , if necessary ) . 
^ instead , just use this time to get your network moving again .
