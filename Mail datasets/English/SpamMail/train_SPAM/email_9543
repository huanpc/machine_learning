^ once or twice in your lifetime , you will see a new technology developed that will change the world . 
^ the transistor and the microprocessor are examples of these . 
^ our company has acquired the exclusive rights to a new technology where tissue antioxidants ( vitamins and various other molecules ) can be non-invasively measured ! ! 
^ this technology , called &name , is protected by &num &name and international patents and is ours exclusively ! ! 
^ &name uses a low power laser on human tissue to obtain an ' optical fingerprint ' of various molecules . 
^ it can quantitate exactly which of these molecules are present in the tissues and exactly how many there are . 
^ using this information , we can derive a body defense index , or &name , which is a clinical estimate of one 's antioxidant protection . 
^ the &name is likely to have as big an impact on medicine as did blood pressure and cholesterol measurement ! ! 
^ everyone in the world will want to know their &name ! ! 
^ over the next &num to &num years , biophotonic measurements will doubtlessly become routine in all doctor 's offices , hospitals , and clinics . 
^ furthermore , everyone will want to know how to improve their &name ; and we have the high-quality nutritional products that can do so ! 
^ obviously , this new technology presents a busuness opportunity of unparalleled proportions ! ! 
^ in the next few months , our representatives will be able to buy and lease these scanners to measure peoples ' &name and to then objectively demonstrate the efficacy of our products in improving it . 
^ the time to &name is now ! ! 
^ this window of opportunity will soon narrow and then close as more and more people get involved . 
^ call &num today to learn how to get involved ! ! 
^ ( to be removed from all of our mailing lists , email &email with ' remove ' in the subject line )
