^ strictly confidential 
^ we are members of a government establishment in &name . 
^ we have successfully secured for ourselves the &name of &num million , &num hundred &num united states dollars ( &name $ 21.5m ) . 
^ my colleagues and &num during the course of our official assignment awarded series of contracts to some firms on agreed &num commission or profit on their contract &name . 
^ however the &num commission which amounted to us $ 21.5m after audit report is left unclaimed in &name account of my establishment since &num . 
^ the contractors have executed their projectas specified in the contract agreement and were paid accordingly . 
^ recently , the new civilian government started paying off all the indebted foreign contractors to my company that executed contracts as far back as &num - &num in order to launder a good image of their government before the united nation . 
^ consequent to this development , we consider this a great opportunity for us to carry out the transfer of these funds to a safe account overseas which we believe you &name in a position to help &name in transferring these funds [ &name $ 21.5m ] into your nominated account overseas , that is outside my country . 
^ it has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with &num of the &name funds , while we keep &num , and &num will be &name aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes . 
^ all modalities of this transaction have been worked out and once started will not take more than &num working days at the maximum with your full support . 
^ this transaction is &num risk free . 
^ if this proposal satisfies you , please reach &name by &name or phone , for more information . 
^ it might be difficult to get through to me , because of poor telecommunication system here in my country . 
^ please keep trying , you will definitely get through . 
^ alternatively you can e-mail me on the above e-mail address . 
^ please treat as urgent and very confidential . 
^ yous faithfully , 
^ &name &name . 
^ &name : for confidential reasons and due to the poor communication system in my country , most often foreign calls could be diverted to the wrong person . 
^ so for you to be very sure you are rightly speaking with me , it is very important that when you call and ask for the me , the moment i pick up the phone , you should ask me what is the ' code word ' and my answer must be ' born great ' before we proceed discussions , but if i do not &name ' born great ' that means you are not speaking with me just disconnect the line and call me back till i give you the code word .
