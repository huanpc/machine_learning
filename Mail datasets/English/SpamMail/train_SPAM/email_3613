^ &name &name &name economic recovery committe federal secretariat , lagos-nigeria . 
^ email : &email 
^ dear sir , 
^ business proposal : transfer of us $ &num m ( &num million , &num hundred &num united states dollars ) & business investments partnership . 
^ first , i must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction , this is by virtue of it 's nature as being utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us in confidence through the nigerian chamber of commerce , foreign trade division . 
^ and if the contents of this mail does meet with your approval , &char humbly crave your indulgence . 
^ i am the chairman of the economic recovery committee ( &name ) set up by the present civilian government of &name to review economic policies of government establishments / parastatals , and find out ways to reduce waste and maximise revenues allocated to them . 
^ in the course of our work at the &name , we discovered this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of contracts by top government officials of the &name &name &name &name ( &name ) . 
^ the company that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned , leaving the sum of us $ 25.2m &num lying unclaimed in the reserve account of &name government . 
^ upon interogation of the directors of engineering and finance , who both happens to be my contemporaries in the university , they confessed to me in confidence that they had an agreement with the original contractor to re-valuate the original contract by &num , as gratification to them . 
^ this &num which amounts to us $ &name was to be their share from the contract , since the original contractor was well disposed towards giving them the conventional &num kickback . 
^ when i now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has discovered this us $ &name , they pleaded to me not to disclose this information to the government as they will lose their jobs and their family names destroyed . 
^ i was at a crossroad , as i did not want my friends to suffer for what other top government officials do and get away with . 
^ i discussed with the other &num members of my committee and we all unanimously agreed to find a foreign contractor who should put a legal claim on the fund and have the money transferred to his or her account as the contractor that completed the contract . 
^ i have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas partner to whom we could used to receive this sum of us $ &num m legally , thereby sub-contracting the entitlement to your company . 
^ this is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running foreign account while in government service , hence the need for an overseas partner . 
^ more interesting is that i and my colleagues has agreed to handl all the local financial commitment for the procurment of all the necessary documents that will give the transaction its legal backing to ensure that your duty will only be your total support and cooperation as soon as you are called upon to receive the fund . 
^ all logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within &num to &num days of commencement . 
^ please if you are interested in this transaction , &char will advise that you send your reply mail to my private mail box address : &email and also include your telephone number to enable me call you . 
^ thanks
