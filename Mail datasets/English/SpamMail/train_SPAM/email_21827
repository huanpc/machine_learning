^ dear &name , 
^ you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . 
^ the purpose of my introduction is that i am &name &name &name , the first son of &name &name &num of the most popular black farmer in &name who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country . 
^ i got your contact through network online hence decided to write you . 
^ before the death of my father , he had taken me to &name to deposit the sum of &name $ &num million ( &num million , &num hundred thousand united &name dollars ) , in &num of the private security company , as he foresaw the looming danger in &name this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company . 
^ this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland . 
^ this land problem came when &name president mr. &name &name introduced a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers , and this resulted to the killing and mob action by &name war veterans and some lunatics in the society . 
^ in fact a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father was &num of the victims . 
^ it is against this background that , i and my family fled &name for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the &name where we are seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father ? 
^ &char money to a more reliable foreign account . 
^ since the law of &name prohibits a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of &name , as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got . 
^ the south african government seems to be playing along with them . 
^ i am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of &name &name for fear of going through the same experience in future , both countries have similar political history . 
^ as a businessman , i am seeking for a partner who i have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . 
^ if you accept to assist me and my family , all i want you to do for me , is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment ( funds ) from their affiliate office here in the &name as &char have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to &website before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money i intend to use for investment . 
^ i have &num options for you . 
^ firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction . 
^ or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country . 
^ whichever the option you want , feel free to notify me . 
^ i have also mapped out &num of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this &name you do not prefer a partnership i am willing to give you &num of the money while the remaining &num will be for my investment in your country . 
^ contact me with the below e-mail addresse , while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction . 
^ thanks , &name bless 
^ yours faithfully , 
^ mr. &name &name
