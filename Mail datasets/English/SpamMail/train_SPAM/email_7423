^ &name : fwd : &name : an open letter to the &name &name 
^ letter from radio station website in &name , home of the &name &name that spewed forth about our president : 
^ name : &name &name &name 
^ &name : &num / &num / &num &name : &num : &num : &num pm 
^ comment : an open letter to the &name &name 
^ earlier this week , while performing in &name , you stated that you were ashamed that our president is from your home state . 
^ i wonder if you realized how many americans would be listening . 
^ this american was listening . 
^ this texan is ashamed that you come from my state . 
^ i serve my country as an officer in the united &name navy . 
^ specifically , &num &name off around the world , executing the missions that preserve the very freedom you claim to exercise . 
^ i have proudly fought for my country in the skies over &name , &name and &name without regret . 
^ though i may disagree wholeheartedly with your comments , i will defend to the death your right to say them , in &name . 
^ but for you to travel to a foreign land and publicly criticize our commander in chief is cowardice behavior . 
^ would you have so willingly made those comments while performing for a patriotic , crowd of texans in &name . 
^ i would imagine not . 
^ how dare you pocket profits off songs about soldiers , their deaths and patriotism while criticizing their commander in chief abroad , even while they prepare to give their lives to ensure your own freedom of speech . 
^ please ask yourself , what have you done to deserve that sacrifice ? 
^ do not try to justify your comments by claiming that you made them only because you care about innocent lives . 
^ never once in our history have we committed troops to war for the purpose of taking innocent lives . 
^ we do it to protect innocent lives , even yours . 
^ if the world leaders of the late 1930's had the vision and courage of our present commander in chief , perhaps the evil men who caused the death of millions in &name would have never had the opportunity to harm a soul . 
^ the potential loss of millions of lives in the future at the hands of today 's evil men necessitate action . 
^ in a separate i am returning to you each and every &name &name &name and cassette that i have ever purchased . 
^ never again will i allow my funds to support your behavior . 
^ all you have done is to add your name to a growing list of american ' celebrities ' who have failed to realize that they have obtained their successes on the backs of the american blue-collar workers such as our servicemen and women . 
^ to &name &name : this texan ? 
^ this american will continue to risk his life to guarantee your freedoms . 
^ what will you do to deserve it ? 
^ pass this to as many people as you know .
