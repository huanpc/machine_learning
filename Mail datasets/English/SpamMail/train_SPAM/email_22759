^ dear sir or madam 
^ if you are a smoker in the &name , in the &name , &name or in &name &name state then we have something for you . 
^ you are probably fed up with paying high prices for your cigarettes and tobacco . 
^ take a look at what we can do for you at 
^ &website 
^ we can send you , legally , by registered air mail , direct to your door , &num cartons of cigarettes or &num &num gram pouches of rolling tobacco ( all brands are available ) from only &num &name - about &num british pounds ( depending on exchange rate ) - fully inclusive of postage and packing . 
^ why pay more ? 
^ this works out to ( again depending on exchange rate ) about &num - &num pounds for a packet of &num - instead of the &name price of @ &num - &num . 
^ yours faithfully .
