^ dear fellow marketer ! 
^ are your sales where they should be ? 
^ can you use &num , &num fresh , quality email to market your business ? 
^ as you know , the key to making any type of sales is having a bunch of fresh a lot of people post their ads to &name and &name websites , trying to get their message out and to make sales . 
^ all they end up with are more emails in their boxes that they seemingly did not ask for . 
^ when in fact , they did . 
^ posting to &name and &name websites today have &num effect only - to get your email address and provide it to other marketers who then send you emails . 
^ instead of getting the you need to make sales , you are the lead . 
^ every time you post to one of those sites , you give your permission to receive emails and offers . 
^ the people are n't wanting to &name from you , they want to sell to you . 
^ and , you know what ? 
^ they are making sales . 
^ would you like to remove yourself from being a lead to one of those getting the can this be ? 
^ you were likely told after joining your program or putting up your website that &name and &name pages are the most logical places to post your ads to gain sales . 
^ most of those referrals come with specific sites for you to join . 
^ perhaps , when you put up your website or joined your program , you even had free access to such pages . 
^ in all likelihood , the &num who tell you that own or have a vested interest in getting you to sign up and use those pages . 
^ why ? 
^ because they want to harvest your email address and sell it to the paying members of those very same pages . 
^ these paying members then either take those addresses physically and put them into bulk mailers or they use the ' in-house ' mailer to send their offers . 
^ since you are &num of the free members , you become a lead . 
^ it 's a vicious circle known to a lot of veteran marketers . 
^ &name and &name pages used to be prime sites to make sales - now they are prime sites to provide to paying members . 
^ so , if you are posting to such sites , you are not making sales . 
^ no human eyes ever see the pages you are posting to . 
^ you are a lead rather than ending up getting them for yourself . 
^ would you like to know how to change that ? 
^ do you want to get for yourself rather than be a lead for name is &name , and i have been where you are today . 
^ once i figured out how the &name &name system really works , i realized i needed to be on the other side to make the real money . 
^ i needed to get not be a lead . 
^ too much time was being wasted , and i was desperate to make sales for my products and my programs . 
^ so , i learned how to use a bulk mailer . 
^ better than that , i learned where to go to find good fresh to put into that bulk mailer to mail out my offers . 
^ do you know what happened then ? 
^ i started making sales ! 
^ before you start thinking that is &name , it is n't. 
^ remember when i mentioned that when you post to &name and &name boards , you are giving permission for others to email you their offers ? 
^ you ' opt-in ' to those site to use their services for free , and in return you agree to receive emails from other members . 
^ this goes for those of you using blasters , as well . 
^ in those cases , it 's understood that you know the rules . 
^ still , ask yourself this - are you making sales posting to those sites ? 
^ or , have you been buying , or thinking seriously about buying , from those others who emailed you ? 
^ we both know the answer to that . 
^ remember , i 've been there , too - and it took me awhile to figure it all out . 
^ after i figured it out , i started paying to become a member to get after a few hundred dollars , i realized this was doing fine for my sales , but with so many sites to visit every single day to collect my &num was spending time i did n't want to spend . 
^ so , i started looking at sites that offered fresh premium lists . 
^ i found that those sites charge a huge amount of money for one-time purchases of i could only email once ! 
^ $ &num for &num premium that i can use only once ? 
^ &name ! 
^ i decided to do something about that . 
^ although by then , i was making the sales to cover the costs , those sales were coming from the other programs i was a member of - not those one-time lists . 
^ i looked into starting a collecting site for myself , check the actual costs of doing that , then see if i can offer more for better prices . 
^ you know what i found ? 
^ i could do it ! 
^ and , i have ! 
^ my company is offering you &num , &num ( that 's &num &num ) quality , fresh , email every day ! 
^ that 's &num , &num fresh quality every month ! 
^ through affiliate agreements with some of the largest producing sites and companies , we are able to offer &num , &num quality - emailed directly to you every single day ! 
^ does it cost ? 
^ yes , it does . 
^ we do have some overhead to be taken care of . 
^ but , that 's the best deal of all . 
^ &name overhead is nowhere near what it costs to maintain a company in the physical world - so we are able to price our subscription program accordingly . 
^ we ask only $ &num each month . 
^ remember , that 's for &num , &num fresh , quality every day - not &num , &num for a month . 
^ and , not &num , &num for each $ &num spent . 
^ that 's only $ &num for &num , &num fresh , quality each month ! 
^ now , i ask you , where else can you find that deal ? 
^ what 's the catch ? 
^ no catch . 
^ the subscription is monthly - it will be billed every month . 
^ at this time , we only accept paypal , so you will need a paypal account to access the service . 
^ the are quality , opt-in , and everyone is ready to buy the opportunity they see is best for them . 
^ perhaps yours ! 
^ where can you find this do we send you the will send you your via email - straight to your inbox . 
^ all you do then is copy & paste the list into your bulk mailer , and send when you desire . 
^ it 's as simple as that . 
^ no websites to access , no passwords or usernames to remember , nothing to bookmark into your browser . 
^ &name , easy email sends - every day !
