^ hi &name - 
^ i 'm going to give you all of my action for thursday 's card for free , no strings attached . 
^ and , no , i 'm not kidding . 
^ but first , i 've got to tell you , monday night was &num of the top &num greatest gambling days of my life . 
^ i told you all &name was going to beat &name &num in monday 's championship game and if not for that very last free throw by ' &name that went in and out , my predicated final score would have been right on the button . 
^ i proved to the world once again why i am the best big game handicapper in the country . 
^ plain and simple . 
^ thanks to &name , tuesday was a day that my ego got fed like never before . 
^ i had over &num , &num new customers buy my &num , 000-star &name &name &name lock winner # &num on monday night . 
^ over one of them e-mailed tuesday to express their thanks and amazement that my predicted final scored was just one-point off the actual final score . 
^ they said that after reading my analysis of the game they were absolutely convinced that &name would win the game and bet them on the money line as i advised them to do . 
^ they said to me they had never come across a handicapper who knew basketball the way i did . 
^ they told me they are now a believer that i am the best big game handicapper in the country . 
^ you see people , it 's not about the money . 
^ yeah , &name was the fourth largest bet i have ever made in my life , but that is not the rush for me . 
^ my thrill is people like yourself , gamblers , saying ' thanks ' for another great call that bailed them out so they can collect on tuesday . 
^ there 's no better feeling in the world if you are a handicapper in this business . 
^ trust me on this . 
^ &name , it 's partly my ego . 
^ knowing the &name &name ' of the world , the &name &name 's of the world , these so-called know-it-all 's taking &name , and i step up and not only give the world &name outright , but just miss the actual final score by a single point . 
^ you have know idea how good that makes me feel . 
^ my only other &num , 000-star release was &name over &name in &num ! 
^ i waited &num years for another game to come along that i felt that strongly about to rate the same . 
^ i think predicting &name &num over &name a full &num hours before tip-off , in writing , on the &name speaks for itself . 
^ and my analysis on the game was right on the money . 
^ go read it . 
^ i reposted it on my &name &name ' website where you can read it absolutely free . 
^ plain and simple . 
^ i must warn you though , you may get chills from reading it because if you had &name , you have to relive your nightmare of being on the wrong side of a &name &name ' mortal lock winner . 
^ you see , if you read my analysis , you will see that i understand the game of basketball . 
^ i see and hear things that other handicappers do n't. 
^ it will always be that way . 
^ and it will continue to be that way in the upcoming &name playoffs . 
^ people , i understand big games . 
^ the &name playoffs will offer more great calls like &name . 
^ i highly suggest you hop on board for the playoffs . 
^ i have a special offer going for the entire playoffs . 
^ and , i will say this again . 
^ i will have more big games to follow in the &name playoffs . 
^ buy my playoff package today . 
^ you will be very glad you did . 
^ here 's the deal : get the rest of the &name regular season - and all of the &name playoffs - for just $ &num . 
^ and here 's the kicker : i 'll throw in baseball throughout that stretch for free too ! 
^ that breaks down to less than $ &num a day for all of your &name playoff and baseball action over the next &num months ! 
^ there is no better value in the handicapping industry . 
^ and you 're getting it all from the best big game handicapper in the industry at &website 
^ this business is about consistently winning for your clientele , and then when the big game comes , you make sure they step out to capitalize on the linemaker 's mistake . 
^ that is what my clients did with my &num , &num , 000-star football championship game of my life ! 
^ &name on the moneyline over &name . 
^ that is what my clients did with my &num , &num , 000-star &name conference tourney &name with &name &name over &name state by double digits as i correctly stated . 
^ that is what my clients did with my &num , &num , 000-star &name tourney &name lock release with &name over &name by the 20-point margin as i correctly stated . 
^ do you get the picture everybody ? 
^ now is the time to jump on board for the &name playoffs at an incredible discount price . 
^ and remember , i 'm throwing in baseball for free too and it 's all yours for $ &num with nothing more to pay . 
^ that 's less than $ &num a day ! 
^ someone bought my package on tuesday and emailed me and asked ' why so cheap ? ' i told him it 's because i would rather have customers join me now so i can convince them i am their goto guy with football less than &num short months away . 
^ i want your business for the long haul , but first , you must have confidence in my ability to make you money . 
^ i know i can . 
^ i have a lot of regular guys that have been with me for years . 
^ they go nowhere else .

^ they mean nothing . 
^ all that matters is the here and now . 
^ i 'm only as good as my next pick . 
^ you 're only as happy as your next winner . 
^ that 's the way it goes , unfortunately . 
^ but , i 'm telling you now , i win for my clients consistently .
