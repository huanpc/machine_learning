^ dear sir , 
^ i am dr. mrs. &name &name , wife to the late nigerian head of state , general &name &name who died on the 8th of june &num while still on active service for our country . 
^ i am contacting you with the hope that you will be of great assistance to me , i currently have within my reach the sum of &num million &name &char dollars cash which i intend to use for investment purposes . 
^ this money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband and a russian firm in our country 's multi-billion dollar &name steel plant . 
^ the russian partners returned my husbands share being the above sum after his death . 
^ presently , the new civilian government has intensified their probe into my husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all our accounts , local and foreign , the revoking of all our business licenses and the arrest of my first son . 
^ in view of this i acted very fast to withdraw this money from one of our finance houses before it was closed down . 
^ i have deposited the money in a security company here in &name ( with a coded name ) as family treasure in &num trunks with the help of very loyal officials of my late husband . 
^ no record is known about this fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received such funds . 
^ due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my family , i am closely monitored and cannot make use of this money , hence i seek your help in receiving these funds and pay into your account for the family safety . 
^ bearing in mind that you may assist me , 
^ &char have decided to part with &num my personal barrister &name &name has been mandated to handle this entire matter with you . 
^ therefore feel free to contact him at &email or &email for more clarification and further discussion . 
^ note that all correspondence should be directed to my lawyer . 
^ &name &name , 
^ dr. mrs. &name &name 
^ faites un voeu et puis !
