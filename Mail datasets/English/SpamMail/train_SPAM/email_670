^ &name / &name : &num &num business partner needed 
^ dear sir or madam , 
^ you may be surprise to receive this email from me since you do not know me personally . 
^ however , i would like to introduce myself . 
^ i am &name &name , the son of dr. &name &name who was murdered few months ago in &name as a result of land dispute . 
^ i was furnished with viable information from the &name &name &name here in &name &name and decided to write to you . 
^ before the death of my father ( dr. &name ) , he had taken me to &name ( the &name ) to deposit the sum of &num million &num hundred thousand united &name dollars ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) in a security company , as he foresaw the looming danger in &name . 
^ the money in question was deposited in a box as gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company . 
^ the proposed amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of new farms on &name . 
^ as you may be aware this land problem came into force when &name president mr. &name &name &name the land reformed act of which my father &name farmers and some black farmers where affected . 
^ this resulted to the killing and mob action by &name war veterans and some lunatics in the society , in fact , a lot of people were killed because of this land reformed act of which my dad was one of the victims . 
^ it is against this background that my family and i who are currently staying in &name decided to transfer my father 's money to a foreign account . 
^ since the english law prohibit a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any account or be involved in any financial transaction . 
^ as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred without the knowledge of the government who are bent on taking everything my family has worked for . 
^ i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in &name for the fear of going through the same experience in future since both countries has similar history . 
^ moreover , &name foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . 
^ as a businessman , whom i have entrusted my future and my family in his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . 
^ recently , i have been able to liaise with a finance company in the &name , who eventually helped me in moving the consignment from &name to the &name kingdom . 
^ if you accept to assist me and my family , all i need you to do liaise with the non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any account you will nominate overseas . 
^ this money i intend using for investment . 
^ i have options to offer you ; first you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the transaction , or you can go into partnership for a proper profitable investment of the money in your country . 
^ which ever option you choose , feel free to notify me . 
^ i have mapped out &num of this money for all expenses incurred in processing of this transaction . 
^ if for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership , i am willing to give you &num of the money , &num to charities while the remaining &num that is meant for me , will be for the investment in your country . 
^ please , contact me on the above email or telephone so we can discuss further and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind , while you maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction . 
^ yours faithfully 
^ &name &name
