^ the second look &name be the one that matters 
^ virtual machines , &name and &name security are all still evolving technologies . 
^ - - by &name coffee -- 
^ people who 've never looked at a technology are usually open to the possibility that it might have something to offer . 
^ the biggest challenge is getting back on the radar of those who looked at &name &num , found it seriously wanting and have moved on to other possibilities . 
^ my recent letter on virtual machines , for example , generated many comments , especially from those who chided me for painting too rosy a picture : these readers felt , primarily , that performance issues are more of a problem than i suggested , almost always based on their experience with products at least &num or &num releases in the past . 
^ ( &name &name coffee 's column ' run what you need on whatever you like' &smiley 
^ i consciously avoided stopwatch-style &num freely admit , for &num reasons . 
^ first , i can make a say anything i want by picking the right combination of task and system configuration . 
^ second , although i find that additional performance is easier to buy than almost any other it resource , i also find that wall-clock time is better reduced by working smarter than by churning bits faster . 
^ for example , ' i use &name &num to run a win2k session on my &name 560e which runs &name &name &num , ' wrote one it pro : ' by doing this i can run our corporate &name software , which is licensed for only &name clients , and run the proper version of outlook to keep our exchange environment happy . 
^ i can also run the various network management tools : some run under &name , and some run under windows . ' 
^ a consultant wrote , ' i use &name to run various windows &name on my &name &num &name system . 
^ i do most of my accounting and some of my graphics work in an emulated &name &name environment . 
^ when clients need support i can switch to that environment or a similar one to facilitate our discussions . ' 
^ several readers described the virtual networks that they can set up on a single physical machine , often just a high-end laptop , to do network-based development and testing even while on an airport layover : ' i build software that runs on &name servers but is served to &name clients . 
^ to develop and test in this environment , i run &name native on my development machine and windows under &name on it concurrently . 
^ thus i have both &name and &name sessions available at the click of a button . 
^ it works very well for the development / testing that i need to do , ' was &num typical comment . 
^ i did n't cherry-pick the reader letters in search of &name users , or &name users running windows as a guest : what you see above is pretty representative of what i got . 
^ and all of these &name users will want to look into the &name &name &num release that the company announces today for release next month . 
^ developers will find that both user- and kernel-level debuggers can now be used in virtual sessions ; multi-session users will from improved sound and streaming-video performance ; all types of user will find it more convenient to move data between sessions with drag-and-drop simplicity , or to create shared folders that are seen by both host and guests . 
^ ( find out more about &name &name &website 
^ the other virtual machine out there , of course , is the &name &name &name , the other technology that too many people think they 've examined and found reason to dismiss . 
^ it 's worth another look . 
^ whatever you think you know about &name 's limitations , version &num may well have directly addressed your concerns . 
^ ( find out more about version &num of &name &name &website 
^ highlights of &name &num include &name parsing and transformation &name , including ' pluggable ' parsers ; security enhancements , including support for certificate chains and for kerberos-based communication between applications ; and input / output enhancements of interest to developers of both single-function systems ( for example , exclusive-mode graphics for high-performance full-screen applications ) and desktop-style applications ( there 's new support for drag-and-drop data exchange ) . 
^ ( check out &name &num version 1.4's new features and &name &website ( find out more about ' pluggable parsers' &smiley ( find out more about &name 2's security &name &website ( &name about the full-screen exclusive mode &name &website ( find out more about drag and drop&smiley &website 
^ &name 's own &name site only notes the availability of &name &num for windows , &name and &name , but &name 's &name &name x--perhaps the most-used single-user &name on the planet , at this point , and making rapid gains on the server as well--also &name &num available for download . 
^ having failed to come up with its own compelling mainstream-desktop solutions , i sometimes wonder if &name has a particular blind spot when it comes to &name : for my own part , i know that when i mention &name &char , i find people associating me with the ' cult of the &name , ' as some call it , but that 's increasingly inaccurate . 
^ the &name foundations of &name &char are drawing the attention of network administrators , computer science educators and other influential users . 
^ ( find out more about &name &num for &name &name &name &website ( check out the independent ' &name &char &name ' &name &website ( check out &name resources page&smiley &website 
^ os &char also gets several mentions in the third edition of ' &name &name & &name &name , ' just released by o' &name & associates inc. ; i especially like this book 's treatment of how to handle security incidents , which are going to occur no matter how careful you are . 
^ ( find out more about ' &name &name & &name security' &smiley 
^ it 's a changing environment , and looking around--even looking again at things you 've already examined--is the only way to avoid unpleasant surprise .
