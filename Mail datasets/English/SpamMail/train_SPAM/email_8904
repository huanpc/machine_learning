^ &name &name serving business 
^ in &name / &name &name &num : &num ' conformity ' is defined as fulfillment by a product , process or service of specified requirements . 
^ ' conformity assessment ' is any activity concerned with determining directly or indirectly that the relevant requirements are fulfilled . 
^ &char note then indicates that typical examples of conformity assessment activities include sampling , testing and inspection , evaluation , verification and assurance of conformity ( supplier 's declaration , certification ) , registration , accreditation and approval as well as their combinations . 
^ i would add to this list both legal and industrial metrology , trusting that in doing this i will not be causing offence . 
^ should any reader feel that this list is incomplete please let me know by e-mail . 
^ for nearly &num years i have witnessed , and sometimes taken part in , the debate about the value of conformity assessment , be it to society at large , to the economy , to the consumer , to business or to the manufacturer . 
^ the viewpoints expressed &name , at the extreme , from those who see conformity assessment almost to have a missionary role in society to those who see the function and costs of conformity assessment to be parasitic . 
^ to bring some perspective to the debate surely there are some fundamentals to acknowledge . 
^ conformity assessment is central to the modern economy . 
^ the basis for transactions is the confidence that the products or services supplied will be in conformity with the supply specification and that there will be some form of recourse in the case of non-conformity . 
^ the field of operation of conformity assessment involves measurements , weights , volumes and statistics , highly skilled people and dedicated capital equipment and systems . 
^ there is no black art but rather the science of conformity assessment . 
^ we can consider situation after situation in the history of economic development in which the application of conformity assessment has provided the solution or the non-application has been the cause of delay or even failure . 
^ governments , whole industries and companies have turned to conformity assessment for solutions in their search for progress . 
^ why then is there such contention as to the role and need for conformity assessment ? 
^ the answers rest in the perceived 'downside ' factors : costs , loss of flexibility , time delays linked with time to market , loss of independence , the prospect of imposed delays in fault situations and the fear of aggressive and commercial ' third party ' bodies interfering and causing excessive and unnecessary layers of assessment . 
^ the result of all of this is that the conformity assessment field , integrated as it is into society and economy and being essential to business , is a battleground fought over for the establishment of strategies and best systems . 
^ at stake are the ownership of resources , the defense of business positions and investments , and the future of jobs and careers . 
^ in the light of the above in the next and final article in this series , i will consider the question : is conformity assessment an expanding business ? 
^ please submit all reactions to this article to : 
^ &name &name currently is the president of having been the secretary general &num , and his heavy involvement with conformity assessment has spanned &num years .

^ &char functional description of conformity assessment is included as an informative annex , as a further aid to mutual understanding , in both voluntary and regulatory environments , among users of conformity assessment , conformity assessment bodies and their accreditation bodies . 
^ as a common basis for the preparation and maintenance of any standards and guides relating to conformity assessment activities , &name / &name &num is intended to offer a consistent framework within which more specific concepts may be defined appropriately and denoted by the most appropriate terms ...

^ if the dramatically fast development of information technologies has opened up a whole new spectrum of technical possibilities , it has at the same time created some deep and difficult problems that need to be solved if progress is to be made in information and communication technologies ( &name ) . 
^ indeed , our lives have subtly but gradually become dependent on technologies for all kinds of areas - they affect everything from smart cards to telephone communications - where their absence today would virtually mean a collapse of the infrastructure we largely and increasingly depend upon - banking , transport , and communications , to mention but some .

^ 'mutual &name ' workshop - european organisation for conformity assessment organised a very well-received workshop on 'mutual recognition - a key instrument for freer markets ? ' . 
^ the aim was to review progress and experience in this field , both in the voluntary and the regulatory sectors , and to draw conclusions for the future . 
^ &num countries were represented at the workshop , which was the latest of the series of critical issues workshops which commenced in &num . 
^ the first &num sessions , chaired by &name &name , &name of unit &char / &num &name &name , respectively covered ' the essentials ' and &name latest developments ' . 
^ the afternoon sessions , chaired by &name &name , the president of covered ' &name &name &name and ideas ' and the ' &num hour &name ' , an innovative feedback session . 
^ topics covered included an overview of &name ( &name &name ) , basic operating instruments ( &name &name ) , an industry view on whether recognition means acceptance ( &name &name ) , a review of the recently published &name / &name &name &num on &name ( &name &name ) , a report on latest developments on recognised agreement groups ( &name &name ) , and on information services in support of these groups ( &name &name ) . 
^ those present were brought up to date on some latest developments in the &name field relating to the newly recognised &name for the european telecommunications services association ( &name &name ) , the pre-recognition agreement group ' total security management ' initiative ( &name &name ) , and the &name between the european &name and &name ( &name &name ) . 
^ the &num hour &name enabled detailed presentations to be made by volunteers from the registered delegates . 
^ don mader of ul talked about a global company contributing to mutual recognition through a transportable conformity assessment strategy , &name &name about the &name scheme and its transition to an &name scheme for electronic components , &name &name about the work of the european association for &name &name , &name &name about the development and role of &name and &name &name about the work of the &name voltage &name . 
^ in commenting on the morning sessions &name &name confirmed the complexity of the mutual recognition field , with ' voluntary ' and 'regulatory ' initiatives trying to resolve the different facets of the issue . 
^ he noted that the morning presentations indicated that there remained a significant future for such initiatives , perhaps even unilateral recognition . 
^ it seemed obvious that regulatory , or government-to-government &name were probably not the best first approach between &num different systems . 
^ he felt that mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sector indeed pave the way for agreements in the regulatory sector . 
^ he felt that the respective contributions of accreditation and peer assessment needed to be understood better , because they are important tools in increasing confidence and preparing for mutual recognition and trade facilitation . 
^ in this respect , the participants supported the idea that the reflection on the concept of accreditation and on its use in the designation of conformity assessment bodies should continue , including in the &name committee on technical barriers to &name , where it had already been on the agenda of the previous &name review of the agreement . 
^ he acknowledged that we are still a long way from the one-stop approach , in relation to evidence of conformity as a basis for reaching the widest possible market , but that there was still no better tool than mutual recognition , which to a certain extent favours the convergence of the systems . 
^ he acknowledged that mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sector deliver specific , practical and rapid results and that agreements in the mandatory sector prepared for future approximation of the systems , through the intense regulatory cooperation made necessary by the implementation of these agreements , which would not take place otherwise . 
^ as a trade official , he congratulated for its activity and for flagging up these issues . 
^ during the whole day , both during the sessions and in the corridors , there was a detailed exchange of views . 
^ in his conclusions to the workshop , &name &name commented on the iterative process which had been taking place during the day . 
^ very experienced presenters had both taught and learnt ; lessons would be passed on to others outside the room and these would be applied , there would be further development on the basis of which the constructive process of learning and teaching would continue . 
^ he raised the earlier question of &name &name concerning the reaction of participants to the benefits of mutual recognition agreements . 
^ the majority of those present felt that mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sector are very important . 
^ whilst there was significantly less support for such agreements in the mandatory sector , where results have been slow to appear , it was generally agreed that the work of governments in this area was advisable . 
^ clearly the &name movement will have to go forward on the basis of the &num sectors working together with increasingly good understanding .

^ the &name &name ( gepr' fte sicherheit ) is a german safety mark , indicating that the product has been tested and complies with the safety requirements of european &name with german national deviations . 
^ the &name &name is not mandatory , but many products are difficult to sell without it because it is highly valued by german and european consumers . 
^ ul international &name &char / &char has recently been accredited by the german accreditation body ' &name der l' nder f' &char &name ' ( &name ) to perform testing , certification and inspection for the &name &name as the first certification bodies ( cb ) outside &name . 
^ as there are different testing options for the ul &name &name especially manufacturers , who operate internationally , benefit from ul 's new service by achieving easier and faster certification . 
^ e.g. a testing at &name 's premises ( &name ) agreement under the &name scheme can be used as basis for the ul &name &name . 
^ testing for the ul-gs &name can also be combined with testing for other european certification marks ( e.g. d-mark , &name , key-mark ) as well as for the us- and canadian market , for &name , &name , &name , &name , &name and for &name ( more information in the next ul articles ) .

^ the technical construction file : the foundation of your ce-mark 
^ not everything in &name is standardized . 
^ there is at the moment not even a standard for &num of the key elements of the &name approach , the technical construction file . 
^ but there are a number of arguments in favour of a standardised technical construction file . 
^ let 's consider first of all the function of the technical construction file . 
^ what if a manufacturer fails to draft one ? 
^ who 's going to know ? 
^ consumers want a copy of the manual , in their language . 
^ business customers insist on obtaining a copy of the declaration of conformity . 
^ but the technical construction file is nobody 's business except the manufacturer 's, because the file contains the company 's essential know-how on the safety aspects of the product . 
^ it 's the reason why a manufacturer should n't hand out copies to clients ; it 's the reason why a manufacturer does n't want to hand over a copy to his importer . 
^ which brings us to the fact that a manufacturer from outside the &name , should get himself an authorised representative . 
^ the &name approach states that a copy of the technical should be held within the &name . 
^ do you want to place critical production information in the hands of your importer , who also happens to produce a similar product , or also sells products from your competitors ?

^ &char new &name / &name guide aims to reduce redundant , costly and time-consuming aspects of ' conformity assessment ' activities and , in doing so , contribute to the efficiency of the international trading system . 
^ as goods and services flow across borders , business partners or government agencies may require verification that they measure up to standards , regulations and other requirements . 
^ this verification is known as ' conformity assessment ' .

^ the objective of this best study is to develop indicators of the economic impact of &name &name ( ca ) procedures for industrial products circulating within the single market . 
^ these indicators will be used to carry out an evaluation of the economic impact of conformity assessment in the single market and should allow the identification of the main sources of the costs / economic impact and to determine the means to reduce this impact , especially in terms of best practices . 
^ moreover , the study will aim to highlight the differential costs of conformity assessment across the internal market for similar sectors / products and their economic implications . 
^ the overall approach to the analysis of the economic impact of conformity assessment is to study the implications for all the affected parties . 
^ the research will analyse both the demand ( manufacturers and distributors ) and supply sides ( conformity assessment bodies ) for conformity assessment services , as well as the effects on and from stakeholders ( product users / consumers , standardisation bodies , chambers / trade associations and public authorities ) . 
^ it will provide an overview of the sector , generate both quantitative and qualitative data , and allow the identification of best practices and types of mutual recognition of conformity assessment .
