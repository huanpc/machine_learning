^ &char &name you ca n't get fired from ! 
^ just this last week , i went through the humiliation of getting laid off , again ! 
^ it really sucks ! 
^ i busted my chops working long hours for my former boss who assured me up and down that he would take care of me . 
^ well , he did . 
^ he showed me the door and asked me to leave without any warning ! 
^ we did n't meet &name &name 's expectations so we have to let people go to trim down i guess they meant me . 
^ now i 'm out of a job , bills piled up high , and the prospects looking pretty dim ... until this last week !
