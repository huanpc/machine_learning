^ are you willing to work ? ? 
^ need extra income ? ? 
^ you get emails every day , offering to show you how to make money . 
^ most of these emails are from people who are not making any money . 
^ and they expect you to listen to them right ? 
^ enough ! 
^ if you want to make money with your computer , then you should hook up with a group that is actually doing it . 
^ we are making a large , continuing income every month .

^ but if you are willing to put in &num hours per week , this might be just the thing you are looking for .

^ looking forward to hearing from you &name 
^ &name after having several negative experiences with network marketing companies i had pretty much given up on them .
