^ dear &name , 
^ i sure wish i had powerful friends ! 
^ everybody 's always 
^ talking about making money online but when you really 
^ look into it , only a few ' well connected ' people are 
^ really cashing in. 
^ as a single mother , i needed something that worked . 
^ until 
^ i found &name 's program , i 'd lost a lot more money than i 
^ ever made in all the ' business opportunities ' i tried . 
^ &name &name ? 
^ i ca n't say that now i 'm some huge ' ba-gillionaire ' , but i 
^ can say that &name 's program really worked- and i will prove 
^ it to you ( click here to see that proof ) . 
^ if a single mother who never even went to college can make 
^ an extra couple thousand dollars in a single month , i bet 
^ you can to ? 
^ click here ( &website ) now 
^ wishing you all the best !
