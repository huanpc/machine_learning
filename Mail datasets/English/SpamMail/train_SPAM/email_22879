^ &website ! 
^ &char &name you ca n't get fired from ! 
^ just this last week , i went through the humiliation of getting laid off , again ! 
^ it really sucks ! 
^ i busted my chops working long hours for my former boss who assured me up and down that he would take care of me . 
^ well , he did . 
^ he showed me the door and asked me to leave without any warning ! 
^ we did n't meet &name &name 's expectations so we have to let people go to trim down cost . 
^ i guess they meant me . 
^ now i 'm out of a job , bills piled up high , and the prospects looking pretty dim ... until this last week ! 
^ last tuesday i opened this &name from &name . 
^ it offered me more than just hope . 
^ it offered me training and cash in &num sweet little package that i could run from my home computer . 
^ the best part is that i get my sales commissions paid instantly directly into my account . 
^ there 's absolutely no waiting around to get paid ! 
^ since that day i 've clocked in several hundreds of dollars in commissions . 
^ my job . 
^ what job ? 
^ i 've never been happier ! 
^ if my story sounds familiar , do yourself a favor and click here !
