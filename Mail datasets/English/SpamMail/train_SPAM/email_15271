^ where&# 146;s my budget ? 
^ assuming a limited budget on your next production -- and i have yet to kiss a limitless &num ( &char ) -- &num broad considerations are always at war : what you 'd like to do and what you can afford to do .

^ i 'll mention specific &name hardware and software from time to time as examples , and throw debatable opinions to the audience . 
^ but , this is not remotely an &name shoot-out , but a discussion of technical parameters that can effect quality in the chain -- whatever the &name . 
^ as a discreet edit * or , using a product no longer in development -- but still plenty potent -- i do n't have many axes to grind or an &name product to defend . 
^ in fact , it is my growing opinion that most of the surviving professional &name in the low-to-medium range from the &# 147;none too lowly anymore&# &num ; &name &name to the avid symphony have basically the same abilities and most differences have little to do with feature sets ... for the complete article , click here .
