' ok , are we talking about testing on  ame ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame , any of the several flavors of  ame , or any of the flavors of  ame ? ^ which service packs ? ^ what security settings , firewalls or antivirus tools are in use ? ^ which blends of other software have been installed ? ^ how has the system been maintained ? ^ which of the thousands of brands , models , and builds of  ame are we talking about ? ^ how much memory is installed ? ^ what 's the hard drive set up ? ^ what 's the skill level of the user ? ^  ame and on ... ^ in the heyday of ink-on-paper computer publishing ,  ame then the largest tech publisher--- had a lab with  um people working in it , and even they made no attempt whatsoever to test broadly on even a tiny fraction of the possible permutations of hardware and software . ^ instead , they ( like most labs ) used simple , standardized reference systems designed to simulate a mythical ' average ' pc . ^ and , of course , these were not systems as used in the chaos of real life , but idealized , perfectly- maintained systems , run by professional testers . ^ if a product got a good rating from that kind of test lab , it suggested that that product would probably work ok for you , as long as your system resembled the test setups . ^ but even there , there was no * guarantee * that the product would work for you . ^ so , i can say with no shame whatsoever that no , i do not and cannot do what the world 's largest tech companies and publishers also cannot do : there 's no way i can ever guarantee that the stuff we discuss here will work flawlessly on every reader 's setup . ^ and consider the software itself : if the world 's largest software publishers---  ame ,  ame , et  ame cannot produce error-free software that works on all hardware and software , for all users of all skill levels , all the time , do you really think some freeware hobbyist software author will manage to do so ? ^ so the first point is really about having reasonable expectations . ^ no software--- especially free , giveaway software--- is likely to be perfect . ^ and no  um not i , nor  ame , nor any testing lab or publisher--- can guarantee that a given product will work flawlessly on your system . ^ that leads to the second point : ^  har ) ' i lost everything ! ' here 's a sad truth : no matter how careful you are , sooner or later something bad * will * happen to your hardware of software--- not 'might happen ' or ' possibly will happen' --- something bad definitely * will * happen . ^ it may be an accidental deletion of something important through user error , it may be a software problem or a hardware failure . ^ regardless , it 's a  um certainty that sooner or later you 're going to lose important data . ^ that 's why i 've talked about backups literally * hundreds * of times in this newsletter . ^ i 've even detailed a complete , total backup process that can restore your data after a * total * hardware failure--- say , your house burns down and melts your pc to slag . ^ yet , many readers still choose to run unprotected--- and then get irate when the inevitable happens , and they lose data . ^ i do n't know how to be any clearer : backups are essential . ^ the more often you make them , the safer you are . ^ or , to put it the other way , if you choose to run without backups , then you are , in effect , choosing to lose data . ^ it 's inevitable . ^ things like ' go back ' and 'system restore ' can help a little , but they are only partial solutions , as we 've also previously discussed in these pages . ^  um small example : both go back and system restore are utilities that run within your operating system . ^ if something really bad happens to your  ame itself , how will you run go back or system restore ? ^ (  ame : you ca n't. ^ you 're toast . ) ^ but there is an easy , inexpensive way to make  um reliable backups that will let you recover from any problem in literally minutes . ^ for example ,  um make ' image ' backups every few days , and data backups every day . ^ it costs me less than  um cents a day for total data security . ^ if you do something similar , there is no reason for you to lose access to your pc or its data--- ever ! ^ in most cases , you can restore data in literally  um minutes or so , or completely rebuild a system 's software--- format ,  ame , apps , data , * everything * --- in maybe  um minutes , using my method . ^ (  ebsite ) ^ sooner or later , everyone who uses a computer will lose data . ^ with some people , it happens fast . ^ others can go for years and years . ^ but everyone , sooner or later , has something bad happen that will make them glad they have backups , if they have them ; or that will make them wish they had backups , if they do n't. ^ but i guess it 's human nature--- people will discount the benefit of something until they need it . ^ unfortunately , with backups , by the time you need them , it 's too late to start . ^ you have to start beforehand . ^ the next item takes a related tack , and shows just how inexpensive it is to have total data security . ^ then , you 'll never have that awful ' oh , no ! ' moment when you realize that your system--- and its data--- has been hosed . ^ click to email this item to a friend  ebsite ^  um ) backups for  um cents per gig ! ^ hi  ame , i am getting concerned that the data accumulated on my pc may be at risk if i do n't find a way to back it up . ^ if i 'm not mistaken , most of your advice re backups assumes that a user has a built-in  ame or cd-r drive . ^ what advice can you offer someone like myself who does n't have these backup drives and who only has access to a  um  ame floppy drive as a backup tool . ^ is it possible to rent an external backup system or should i simply invest in the purchase of a cd-r drive ? ^ perhaps there are other readers out there who share my situation and could also benefit from your suggestions . ^ sincerely ,  ame  ame ( a very satisfied plus ! ^ reader ) ^ a lot of users hesitate about backups because they assume they 'll need to invest hundreds of dollars to set something up . ^ in reality , backups are much , much cheaper than most people think . ^ ( mine cost me  um cents a day . ) ^ but before we get to the costs , ask yourself  um question , as a very simple , informal cost / benefit analysis : ^ ' what would it cost , in direct expense and in time , to recreate all my data , files , settings , etc. , from scratch ? ' ^ in other words , ballpark the absolute , rock-bottom minimum value of the data on your system simply by estimating how long it would take to get the stuff you need back to an acceptable condition , restoring or recreating it if you lost the contents of your hard drive . ^ then , multiply that amount of time by whatever your time is worth . ^ even at minimum wage , and even if the value of your files and data is  um ( which is almost never the case ) , fully restoring your system just once , ever , in its life will usually more than offset the purchase cost of a basic  ame drive , just in time-savings alone . ^ and it 's odds-on that the value of your files and data is way more than $  um . ^ some of your files may have intrinsic monetary value--- tax or banking or business records , for example . ^ other files and data have a value represented by the effort and time it took to create them . ^ for example , how much time have you invested in setting up your system , getting it right , downloading patches , installing software , etc. ? ^ still other files may have value that 's hard to quantify--- special photos , music , lists of favorite sites , etc. but there is still a value there , even if it 's hard to pin down . ^ in fact , when you add it all up , the true , full value of the stuff on your hard drive is probably worth hundreds , thousands or--- no , i 'm not kidding---  um of thousands of dollars . ^ add it up : if your answer , either in direct cost or in time spent , is that your data and setup is worth more than a mere $  um or so , then go out and buy an inexpensive  ame drive right now ! ^ that 's all they cost , if you catch a sale ; and even off-sale , you can almost always get a new  ame for less than $  um . ^ that 's all it takes--- a basic $  um  ame drive and some bulk-purchased blank cds , and you 're on your way to total data safety . ^ this way , your actual backup costs will run in the vicinity of  um cents per hundred  ame . ; or  um cents per gig . ^ i create a full image backup of my  ame primary partition several times a week , for example : it fits ( compressed ) on  um generic blank cds that cost me a total of  um cents . ^ think of it :  um cents for  um , rock-solid , total data security . ^ is there any reason * not * to make backups ?

^ i 'll admit this took a some effort with a disk editor and the internet to figure out , but the results were worth it . ^ the glue that holds it all together is an open source [ free ] boot loader called  ame available at  ebsite . ^ this little utility is fairly simple to install ( it fits on a single floppy disk ) and deliciously powerful in its configuration . ^ with the help of ghost or drive image you can work some multiboot magic . ^ for instance here 's what i have setup . ^ because each  ame may have particular installation requirements like  um cylinder boundary restrictions ,  um  ame partition limits , etc , i partitioned the disk like this : ^  ame  um  ame  ame  ame  um ( 2gb )  ame  ame  um windows  um  ame ( 4gb )  ame  ame  um  ame  ame professional ( 26gb )  ame  ame partition containing :  ame  um windows  um second edition ( 8gb )  ame  ame  um  ame  ame  ame  um ( 4gb )  ame  ame  um  ame swap ( 1gb ) linuxswap  ame  um  ame  um ( 70mb )  ame  ame free space ^  ame installs in the master boot record a small boot loader program that then loads a menu application , whose files can be installed in a dedicated  ame partition type or any fat16 or  ame partition . ^ i chose to put the  ame menu files in the  ame logical partition . ^ the first step is to install each  ame operating system by itself so that it resides in a  har drive . ^ make an image and store it preferably on another computer . ^ once that is done , partition the hard disk accordingly , install  ame and restore each  ame to its final location . ^ when you configure the  ame  ame menu , you choose the partition to boot from and optionally , you can hide the other  ame partitions so that each  ame will still see itself as the  har drive . ^  ame is best installed after all the other  ame are in place so that you can setup grub or  ame without complications . ^ as for the trick to get windows  um to boot from a logical partition ? ^ this web site  ebsite provided the answers . ^ basically , you need to edit the  ebsite ( which comes with both drive image and  ame  ame , or as a free download from their web site ) to tell the boot loader where to locate the boot sector for a particular  ame  ame residing in the extended partition . ^ for  ame / win9x , you must also enable the  ame extension in the partition by using a disk editor . ^ you can also boot from a floppy via  ame , which is handy since you will have to boot from a floppy and sys  har : the partition . ^ the ability to  ame  ame residing in a logical partition  ebsite which offered a  ame menu that launched  ebsite client from the hard drive rather than from a floppy disk . ^ with command line switches i can easily reghost the whole disk or individual partitions with  um quick keystrokes after a reboot . ^ of course , very few home computer users would want to go to this much trouble for multibooting , but i just wanted to point out a solution that saved my employer $  um ,  um ; the alternative was a  ame multiboot card . ^ thanks for your time ,  ame chee ^ excellent ,  ame ; thanks ! ^ so you see , multibooting is an enormously flexible , powerful technique whether you just want to run  um  ame or  um ! ^ click to email this item to a friend  ebsite ^ - -- ( your  ame on ad links help keep the langalist  ame free ! ^ ) --- ^ 50-80% off retail ! ^  ame  ame ! ^  ame ! ^  ame ! ^ free stuff , too ! ^ ( a href '  ebsite ) ^ -------------- ( the above is an advertisement )-------------- ^  um ) nt / 2k /  ame  ame  ame ^ flaw in  ame  ame  ame could allow denial of service attacks  ame :  ame  ame  um ,  um ,  ame  ame : denial of service  ame  ame : important ^  ame , patches , and a workaround for  ame ( which cannot be patched ) :  ebsite ^ click to email this item to a friend  ebsite ^  um ) last hours to enter march 's free drawing ^ later today , march  um , i 'll choose another monthly winner of  har no-  ebsite--- books , software , hardware , kitchenware , toys ... to have a shot at winning , just use the following link to recommend the langalist to a friend . ^ your friend just may find a new source of useful information ; i just may gain a new subscriber ; and you just may win a $  um shopping spree ! ^ ( full details also available via this link ) :  ebsite ^ the more times you make a recommendation , the greater your chances are of winning ! ^ or , if you 'd like to try to win $  um ,  um ( ! ) , try this link ( full details also available here ) :  ebsite ^ either way , thank you , and good luck ! ^ click to email this item to a friend  ebsite ^  um ) x-ray vision into your pc ^ hi  ame ! ! ^ i 've been a subscriber to the langalist for just over a year now and i love it . ^ it 's the only one i find to be an interesting read from beginning to end on a regular basis . ^ the free utilities are at times a godsend so thank you so much for posting them . ^ i do however need a utility that does one little thing . ^ i need to run an analysis on the memory in all my computers .. find out how many banks are populated and by what type of  ame . ^ there 's been a mixture of  um  ame and  um  ame  ame found in a few computers now and some , i have no idea what the specs are other than size . ^ i found a fairly good utility but it 's a full analysis of the whole computer and all i need is to check what  ame is in there ... quickly without a big install . ^ do you know of anything that can help me out ?
