^ with warm heart i offer my friendship , and greetings , and i hope this mail meets you 
^ in good time .

^ have not met personally or had any dealings in the past , i humbly ask that you take 
^ due consideration of its importance and immense benefit . 
^ i duly apologize for 
^ infringing on your privacy , if this contact is not acceptable to you , as i make this 
^ proposal to you as a person of integrity . 
^ first and foremost i wish to introduce myself properly to you . 
^ my name is &name 
^ &name &name , i am a nephew and personal assistant to &name &name &name &name , 
^ leader of &name ( &name &name for the total independence of &name ) . 
^ as led by my 
^ instinct , i selected your email address from an internet directory , in my search for 
^ a partner , hence this email . 
^ i also crave your indulgence to read this carefully , and have a general overview of 
^ my situation . 
^ my uncle ( &name ) was killed in a battle with government forces of 
^ &name , led by president &name &name , on friday 22nd &name &num . 
^ after his death , 
^ mr. &name &name who was his second in command , assumed office as leader of &name , 
^ due to lack of the charisma my uncle had carried the party with in &name , there was 
^ chaos and struggle for leadership . 
^ prominent members like &name &name lobbied to 
^ depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw 
^ me as a threat to their ambitions , including mr. &name , planned to kill me . 
^ the 
^ tension and confusion in &name become uncontrollable when mr. &name died 10days 
^ after my uncle 's death . 
^ as i lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for 
^ &num decades now , not so much of the struggle interested me anymore , as there was 
^ no more sense of direction . 
^ i then desired a peaceful life , as i am no more int ! 
^ erested in conflicts and wars . 
^ for this reason , i secretly left &name and came here 
^ ( &name ) to seek for political asylum . 
^ i am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in 
^ respect to safekeeping of some of my uncle 's money that arose from &name sales . 
^ this money ( &name $ 18.5million ) , which was already on its way to my uncle 's swiss bank 
^ account , through the diplomatic means we use to move money abroad , and was on 
^ transit with a private safe deposit security and finance company here in &name &name 
^ &name last year when the tragic incident of my uncle 's death occurred . 
^ i then 
^ instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on 
^ further instructions from me . 
^ i have waited for sometime now for security reasons , 
^ and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance . 
^ as a matter of fact , the 
^ reason i came to &name and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit 
^ with the security company . 
^ president &name &name &name &name has lobbied the international community to freeze 
^ my uncle 's assets and accounts abroad , to ground unita , and has already done this in 
^ &name . 
^ hence &num cannot lodge the funds in my name . 
^ also i did not declare the funds 
^ to the here . 
^ i plan to use this money to safeguard my future . 
^ it is very essential that you 
^ understand that the kind of trust and confidence i want to put in you is 
^ extraordinary , and an act of desperation on my part , in order not to lose this 
^ money . 
^ also , ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy . 
^ your role in this project , is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which 
^ is deposited in my name , from the security company , after which , the money will 
^ lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this 
^ transaction . 
^ my share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum 
^ application in this country is granted , and i have permission to do business and 
^ open an account here . 
^ for your reliable assistance , i will reward you with &num ( $ &num , &num , &num ) of the money . 
^ i have with me , the certificate of deposit for the consignment containing the funds , 
^ which will be used for claim from the security company , and the release codes of the 
^ vaults .

^ and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt 
^ response .
