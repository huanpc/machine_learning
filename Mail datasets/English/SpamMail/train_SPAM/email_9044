^ hence i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government home that are bent on taking everything we have got . 
^ the government of &name &name seems to be playing along with them .

^ but before then all modality will have to be put in like change of ownership of the consignment / funds and more importantly this funds i intend to use for investment . 
^ i have &num opinions for you . 
^ firstly , you can choose to have certain percentage of the funds for nominating your for this or we can go into partner for proper wise investment of the funds in your country . 
^ which ever the option you want , feel free to notify me .
