^ ( &website ) update 
^ &name &name ! 
^ it appears to us that &name is on a roll . 
^ not only for the company , but also the stock price . 
^ in just a few short days &name 's stock has gone from $ &num per share to an intra day high of $ &num per share on friday . 
^ &char &num gain in just a few short days , not &name ! 
^ congratulations to all our members that reacted to our news alerts . 
^ for those of you that have been following &name , we believe that this is only the &name of the iceberg , and let us tell you why . 
^ if we just use some common sense , then we believe that logic could prevail . 
^ in just about &num days , &name has released a series of &name that on the surface has quadrupled their revenues from year ending &num of $ &num million dollars , to just this past week giving us new guidance ( not including this new &name ) of $ &num million dollars for &num based on current transactions to date . 
^ now , &name after the &name market closed on friday comes out with &name &name , in our opinion . 
^ why is it &name ? 
^ well , on the surface , not only does it increase &name 's top line by more than &num , but also as &name continues to grow rapidly , in our opinion , this type of &name should become more common and regular . 
^ why , you may ask ? 
^ let 's apply some common sense , and you can see how we arrive at our logic . 
^ chances are &num months ago , &name like this probably would not have occurred . 
^ reason being &num months ago &name was projecting &num million dollars in revenues for &num , and a transaction of this size would have represented &num of &name 's total revenues and probably would not have happened . 
^ now it only represents about &num , and in our opinion makes it easier for a company like &name to close transactions of this nature . 
^ remember this industry is $ &num billion dollars large with a lot of &name & pops that are ripe for the taking . 
^ it appears to us , that &name is solidifying their footprint in the state of &name , once accomplished , there are &num other states to go after . 
^ on a technical note , with this past weeks move up in &name 's stock price on heavier than normal volume , it appears to us that the next resistance level could be $ &num per share . 
^ with last weeks upward momentum , and this new &name , and potentially more &name forthcoming , we think that &name could cut through $ &num per share like a &name knife trough butter . 
^ keep a really close eye on &name , and as always watch this stock trade !
