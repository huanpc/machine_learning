^ maintain formatting in an electronic copy of a report ( &name &num / &num / &num ) 
^ we recently told you about the office links feature , which lets you save a report as an &name file . 
^ this provides an easy way to share report results with users that do n't have access . 
^ however , the exported &name file may not support all of the formatting used in the original report and it wo n't include any graphical objects . 
^ as reader &name &name points out , reports can be saved as &name files , which retain the look of the original access report . 
^ to create a snapshot with access &num , you need to be running access or office with the sr-1 update . 
^ &name &num and above automatically include the ability to save snapshots by default . 
^ once a snapshot is created , users can view it without having access installed -- they just need the &name &name application . 
^ the viewer is available from &website . 
^ the process to create a snapshot is simple . 
^ first , preview your report . 
^ then , in &name &num , select file | save as / &name from the menu bar , choose the to an external file or &name option , and click ok . 
^ in &name &num and above , just choose file | &name from the menu bar . 
^ next , regardless of the version , choose &name format from the save as type dropdown list , name your file , and click &name . 
^ &name creates a file with an &name extension that you can open with the &name &name ( &name &num automatically launches the viewer by default ) . 
^ note that the snapshot is a read-only file . 
^ although you can print it , you ca n't make any changes to the content .
