^ $ $ $ &quot;true story&quot; seen on &name 's &num &quot;boy &num makes &num &num in &num wks!!!&quot; 
^ parents of 15-year-old find $ &num , &num cash hidden in his closet . 
^ does this headline look familiar ? 
^ of course it does . 
^ you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &name ) . 
^ his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . 
^ nothing could have prepared her for the shock she when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . 
^ five-dollar bills , &num , &num and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles . 
^ &quot;my first thought was that he had robbed a bank&quot;, says the 41-year-old woman , &quot;there was over $ &num , &num dollars in that bag -- that 's more than my husband earns in a year&quot;. 
^ the woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . 
^ he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . 
^ little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . 
^ as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e-mail , a type of &name to e-mail addresses that he obtained off of the &name . 
^ everyday after school for the past &num months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . 
^ &quot;i just the e-mail &num day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out&quot;, says the clever 15-year-old . 
^ the e-mail letter listed &num addresses and contained instructions to send &num $ &num dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . 
^ the letter on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . 
^ &quot;i get junk e-mail all the time , and really did not think it was to work&quot;, the boy continues . 
^ within the first few days of sending out the e-mail , the &name office &name that his parents had him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &num bills . 
^ &quot;about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it . 
^ there was also a yellow slip that said i had to up to the [ post office ] counter . 
^ i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs)&quot;. 
^ he on , &quot;i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . 
^ i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all&quot;. 
^ over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e-mail.&quot; the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework&quot;. 
^ he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &num bills for &num , &num and hundreds . 
^ &quot;i did n't want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like &num thousand at a time in my backpack . 
^ i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in [ to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . 
^ &num time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ).&quot; 
^ in fact , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . 
^ it was completely legal according to &name &name and &name &name , &name &num , section &num and &num , or title &num , section &num in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , &name &num , sections &num and &num , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . 
^ here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by e-mail , you can do the exact same thing he was doing , simply by following the instructions in this letter .
