^ urgent request : &num ways to help now that war has started 
^ working &name &name on the war on &name : march &num , &num 
^ what is to be done now ? 
^ war has begun despite our best efforts and those of millions of others around the united states and the world . 
^ our opposition to the war continues , but it is also time to turn our attention to helping to rebuild a post-war &name . 
^ working assets has launched the working &name &name &name &name fund for both immediate relief and help in building grassroots democratic organizations inside &name . 
^ immediate relief grants will go to nonprofits ( like &name &name and doctors without borders ) working to provide medical care and clean drinking water to the victims of war . 
^ i hope you can give generously . 
^ click here to donate . 
^ even as we raise funds for relief and rebuilding , we continue to keep opposition to the war in the public eye through our anti-war billboard campaign . 
^ even today we have billboards up that read &# 147;support our troops , bring them &name now&# &num ; in &name &name and &name &name , with more on the way . 
^ if you would like to expand this campaign , please click here to make a contribution . 
^ perhaps the best that can be said about this war is that it is profoundly un-american . 
^ our opposition to a preemptive attack has been based on those most fundamental american traits of optimism , hopefulness , and a basic sense of decency and compassion . 
^ the &name people have long suffered under their sadistic dictator &name &name as well as the impact of international sanctions , but war is not the way to help the &name people . 
^ we have squandered all of the enormous good will that was engendered by the tragic terrorist attacks of september &num . 
^ we have split &name and &org . 
^ we have in the clumsiest of ways sought to bribe and bully nations who harbored legitimate doubts about the &name administration strategy . 
^ the long-term costs of this are likely to be profound as future administrations or future generations seek to address terrorism , aids and other epidemics , global poverty , and global warming . 
^ with the bombs now falling , it is our deepest hope that the conflict is brief and decisive and the rebuilding generous and democratic . 
^ we hope for the safety of our troops and for their care and fair treatment in the future . 
^ for the future , if this administration is emboldened by rapid victory , our opposition will simply need to be even stronger . 
^ sincerely , 
^ &name &name president
