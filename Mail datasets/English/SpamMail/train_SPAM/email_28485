^ &name ( the greek sandwich ) sure are good . 
^ but no matter how you pronounce it when you order , you will always get flack from someone ; either from your tablemates or the wait staff . 
^ if you size up the restaurant and find it to be of a greek persuasion , you should pronounce it properly , that is to pronounce it so the ' &char ' sounds like a hard ' &char ' ( as in &name ) . 
^ that will solicit a snicker from someone at the table who thinks it 's pronounced as it 's spelled ( like the spinning top ... gyro ) . 
^ but you can fire back a nasty stare because you are correct . 
^ now , let 's say you are in a small diner in a small , non-greek town . 
^ you know someone in the kitchen is greek , but it sure ai n't the waitress standing in front of you . 
^ you order the ' h' yro sandwich . 
^ sure as i 'm sitting here , someone at the table will correct you , possibly even a stranger who happens to be in earshot of your voice . 
^ they will insist you must be ' one of those ' who thinks you are now better than them because you tried to over enunciate a word . 
^ my suggestion ... only order the sandwich when dining alone !
