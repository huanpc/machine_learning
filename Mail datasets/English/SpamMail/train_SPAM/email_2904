^ from : mrs. &name &name 
^ please endeavour to &name it for the children of &name . 
^ i am the above named person from &name but now undergoing medical treatment in &name . 
^ i am married to dr. &name &name &name who worked with &name &name in &name &name for &num years before he died in the year &num . 
^ we were married for &num years without a child . 
^ he died after a brief illness that lasted for only &num days . 
^ before his death we were both born again christians.since his death i decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the &name is against.when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $ 27.6million ( &num million &num hundred thousand &name dollars ) with &num finance / security company in &name . 
^ presently , this money is still with the security company . 
^ recently , my doctor told me that i would not last for the next &num months due to cancer problem . 
^ though what disturbs me most is my stroke . 
^ having known my condition i decided to donate this fund to church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to instruct here in. &num want a church or individual that will use this to fund churches , orphanages and widows propagating the word of &name and to ensure that the house of &name is maintained . 
^ the &name made us to understand that &name is the hand that giveth . 
^ i took this decision because i do n't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not christians and i do n't want my husband 's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers . 
^ i do n't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner , hence the reason for taking this bold decision . 
^ i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going . 
^ i know that i am going to be in the bossom of the &name . 
^ &name &num &name &num says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my peace . 
^ i do n't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health , and because of the presence of my husband 's relatives around me always . 
^ i do n't want them to know about this development . 
^ with &name all things are possible . 
^ as soon as i receive your reply i shall give you the contact of the finance / &name company &name . 
^ i will also issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- beneficiary of this fund . 
^ i want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shephard . 
^ my happiness is that i lived a life of a worthy christian . 
^ whoever that wants to serve the &name must serve him in spirit and truth . 
^ please always be prayerful all through your life . 
^ any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or christian individual for this same purpose . 
^ please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated herein . 
^ hoping to hear from you . 
^ remain blessed in the name of the &name . 
^ yours in &name , &name &name &name .
