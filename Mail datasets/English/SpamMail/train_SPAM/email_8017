^ dear in a recent issue of your email i read the following comment : 
^ ' please note : if you see a &name student or a liberal & please explain to them which is which is they always get it backwards . . . . ... ' 
^ i am a liberal , and have been reading this for several months . 
^ although i do not agree with many , many of the points of view of your publication , i have always enjoyed the inherent in it , until now . 
^ i had never really considered this paper a conservative publication for conservative minds until now . 
^ ironically the comment is intended to suggest that liberals ( and &name students ) do not have a sense of or are too foolish to differentiate between and so i propose a question : since this joke is meant to single out a group of people whose ideals obvioulsy differ the publshers of this publication , why stop there ? 
^ why not include black jokes , polish jokes , or make fun of the jews ? 
^ &name , we you could even make this a publication aimed soully at republicans and oil barrons . 
^ you may want to try to get as many people in the &name on your mailing list too . 
^ they would think this is a hoot . 
^ &name , guess i was getting my and my confused again . 
^ or might it have been that your was absence of hmmmm. . . 
^ &website ) 
^ dear mr. &name , 
^ i do n't suppose that you would believe me if i told you that statement has been in ' &char & &char ' for years . 
^ it 's really difficult for me not to make fun of democrats but i try hard not to . 
^ how about this however : 
^ &name ' mental delay tied to &name ' &name diet 
^ ( &name ) the infants of &num mothers who did not eat any animal products , including milk and eggs , developed brain abnormalities as a result of a deficiency , the us centers for disease control and &name ( &name ) reported thursday . 
^ the primary sources of vitamin &name , which is essential for brain development , are animal products like meat , dairy products and eggs . 
^ since the mothers ate little or no animal products , too little vitamin &name was transmitted to their children through breast milk , according to the &name 's dr. &name &name &name . 
^ ( now we know what happened to certain democratic senators . ) 
^ your devoted p.s. really ' &char & &char ' is just bias stuff i 'm interested in not bias stuff like ' &name ' or ' newsweek ' ( all are biased in someway ) there i go again sorry . 
^ you know that the media singles out certain folks to adulterate but i save &num of my jocosity for good old &name . 
^ dear add my address to your subscription list . 
^ i love your news letter . 
^ it 's a refreshing mixture of mental challenges and truth . 
^ &name ( &email ) 
^ dear i graduated ! ! ! 
^ could you change my email address thanks 
^ &name ( &name ) systems engineer &org land systems 
^ dear i receive and through my school web address and i enjoy reading it all the time . 
^ i have a boyfriend who is in the air force and is over seas right now and i would like for you to send him your newsletter . 
^ his email address is &email . 
^ thank you very much . 
^ &name &name 
^ hey mr. &name , is this similar to * * * form &name with love * * * ? 
^ i was out of town , my mother is very ill and may be dying . 
^ &name now my head is splitting , but just reading a bit of your newletter , i have to ask you , do n't you think that there is a confusion between ethics and other domains of such as religious and legal this is the problem of pseudo ethics . 
^ although moral right often overlaps with legal and religious beliefs about what is morally right and wrong , there is a difference between legality , morality and religion . 
^ besides , it is hard to find a real ethical relativist , since most of them hold some absolute claim on at least &num issue . 
^ that 's all it takes , &num issue , and you 're not a relativist ... &name later . 
^ &name 
^ dear &name , 
^ will pray for your mother ... 
^ your devoted 
^ i just wanted to comment on your statement about &name parenthood in your last newsletter . 
^ i 'm a christian and i 've been with the man i love for &num years ; however , we 're both in college and struggling to make ends meet until he graduates and can work full time and get a job with benefits . 
^ in addition , i do n't have insurance , which means i just ca n't afford to go to a gynecologist who charges twice as much for the same services as planned parenthood does . 
^ i would never consider getting an abortion and believe it is morally wrong , but that is not the only service planned parenthood provides . 
^ you made the comparison of teenagers having sex to teenagers smoking you should know that &name &name , a huge tobacco company , also owns kraft foods . 
^ perhaps buying birth control pills planned parenthood helps fund an organization that provides abortions . 
^ however , buying macaroni and cheese helps fund an even larger organization that targets smoking campaigns to teenagers . 
^ does that stop anyone buying macaroni and cheese ? 
^ no. 
^ i fully agree that a christian newsletter should discourage abortions ; however , keep in mind that &name &name also helps young married couples who are poor as dirt and do n't have anywhere else to turn to get birth control . 
^ if you want &name &name destroyed , are you going to buy my pills for me ? 
^ &website ) 
^ dearest &name , 
^ i suppose my riposte depends on whether ' the man you love ' is your husband or not . 
^ if not , then you should stay out of the sack together until you 've tied the knot ! ! ! 
^ if yes , then work hard & save a bunch & stay out of such a &name & family hating place . 
^ contraceptives do n't cost that much anyway ! ! ! 
^ do you happen to know that the founder of &name &name wanted to use her organization to rid &name of minorities . 
^ &char for &num am thankful for their contributions to our heritage ... 
^ your committed 
^ yet again , i find myself dumbfounded by your extreme bias and blatant religious and political propaganda . 
^ to suggest that the only morality is &name how can you be ! 
^ i 'm willing to put a lot of money on the odds of you being a baptist . 
^ you become angry with people who challenge your views and your way of thinking , showing their views only to make fun of and belittle them . 
^ the mere suggestion that there is no morality without &name it ludicrous . 
^ &name your history books the most heinous massacres in the history of the world have been carried out in the names of various gods . 
^ and i know what you 'll say the &num true &name would not permit this . 
^ but do n't forget , he is a jealous and vengeful &name , and he inspired the incredibly bloody and pointless crusades , which had nothing to do with taking the holy land . 
^ these were on the killing of muslims of the ottoman / byzantine empire . 
^ i argue that there is less morality when taken in the name of &name . 
^ &name corrupts , &name permits the unspeakable , if it benefits him . 
^ think if we were speaking of a politician . 
^ this politician denounces acts of violence and destruction , calling them immoral and evil . 
^ however , as soon as something occurs which undermines a policy of this politician , he orders his people to slaughter the perpetrators , leaving none alive . 
^ if i 'm a voter , i do n't vote for him again . 
^ it 's the same with the christian view of &name . 
^ if i 'm a worshipper , i get away any church which holds as values the murder of innocents which is so favored and celebrated in the &name . 
^ it 's hypocritical and unjust . 
^ i 'm not even going to get started on how ignorant you sounded about abortion . 
^ the whole smoking / cigarettes reference ? 
^ please . 
^ maybe you should go back to school somewhere and learn about analogies , because it 's clear that you do n't understand them . 
^ the abortion rights issue and birth control have absolutely nothing in common with your little smoking analogy . 
^ it 's completely out of left field , and it does nothing to support your argument . 
^ i only wish there was some way for me to attach a disclaimer to the heading of each of your emails : warning : extremely biased content to follow . 
^ do not attempt to debate issues , as author will not &name things any &name but his / her own . 
^ * with moral clarity * , &website ) 
^ &name remove me your mailing list . 
^ now . 
^ dear professor , 
^ no anger here & no baptist either ( although they are my christian brothers ) . 
^ you accuse christians of harming ' innocents ' while you support harming the most innocent of all the soon to be born children . 
^ i suppose everybody is in favor of the death penalty . 
^ with christians it 's cold blooded murders with liberals it 's soon to be born children , old people and the handicapped . 
^ i suppose also that everyone is in favor of censorship : 
^ &num ) christians anti family / female / children stuff . 
^ &num ) liberals the &name . 
^ liberals dispise what &name and her heritage exemplifies but idolize her enemies i.e. &name , &name &name , &name , etc. when was the last time that senators &name , &name , &name , or &name spoke negatively about &name &name , &name , &name or &name &name &num ? 
^ send me a quote . 
^ once again may i suggest that the crusades was a king / &name event of &name . 
^ liberals always like to accuse others of the very things that they are doing . 
^ you were yelling ( bold print above ) at me & calling me closed minded while you cannot consider others views and must unsubscribe . 
^ if you were open minded , would you not want to perhaps ' check out ' what the other side is saying . 
^ i do this all the time . 
^ the smoking analogy was &name &name . 
^ i suggest you call his show and discuss it with him if you are able to handle his logic . 
^ as far as ethics and the &name go , check this & future issues to see what our founding fathers had to say on this very subject ( men far wiser than you or &char ) . 
^ your ardent &name &name will be happy to remove you when you write him at the address below . 
^ i used to like your newsletter , until it became little more than session . 
^ i think you 're wasting your wit on such an easy target , as the french certainly are . 
^ after all , it is &name that we 're at war with , not the french . 
^ i 'm still trying to figure out why a true christian would make fun of someone for being a pacifist . 
^ i ca n't recall a single instance of &name teasing &num of his disciples for turning the other cheek . 
^ however , i do recall something about him yelling at &name for brandishing a sword . 
^ please focus your ridicule on our enemies . 
^ &name , &name &name 
^ hey &name , 
^ all in good fun . 
^ remember that biblical instructions to individuals & nations are different . 
^ liberals get them mixed up ... 
^ your devoted p.s. see love letter to the french me below : 
^ &name this article might be helpful for &name , who is believes &name &name is a good program . 
^ while this article should be seen as cohersive and should be examined more in depth , it takes an interesting look at &name &name ( the founder of &name &name ) . 
^ it is argued that &name supported the &name party , and a quote in this article , it does seem like she envisioned some kind of superior race . 
^ of course , if she is really that interested , she should do more research and find out the context of the quote and should find out more about &name &name . 
^ however , she should be aware that every historian has an angle . 
^ also , a personal comment about teen sex . 
^ not everyone does it . 
^ and the people who do , probably did it because so many people had thrown it aside and said ' they are going to do it anyway . ' there is definitely a lack of accountability . 
^ i know many people who wish they would have waited , but why should they when it is so easy not to wait ? 
^ &name ( &name student ) 
^ &website 
^ i was wondering something : 
^ if you ate jalepe' &char ice cream too fast do you think you would get brain &website ) 
^ please put my friend who is stationed in &name right now on your email list his email address is thank you so much these guys could really use the &name 
^ dear i just want to let you know that i am president of &name &name atheists in &name &name we operate the first atheist community center established in the &name . 
^ i suspect that i was put on the mailing list by some christian ( without my permission ) for that reason . 
^ but i do n't really know . 
^ if you folks have an honest interest in addressing the &name &name ( the claim the god exists ) , i will be happy to take on the challenge . 
^ but most christians do not want to address fundamentals , especially when they are fundamentalists . 
^ so , for the record , here a few facts for you : 
^ there is no god therefore &name is not the son of god ( assuming he ever existed ) the bible is an appalling book that any decent person would abhor ethics are rooted in biology and human discourse , not religious doctrines there are no spiritual forces in the universe 
^ you have a nice weekend as well . 
^ &name 
^ hey &name , 
^ you know we would n't be having this discussion if you did n't have doubts . 
^ if someone were to tell me that they believed in pink elephants , i would n't even bother to discuss this with them because i do n't believe in pink elephants . 
^ you do know what the &name says about ' those who say there is no &name ' ( &name &num : &num ) .
