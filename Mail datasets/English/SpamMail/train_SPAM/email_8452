^ &num expert series : how the &name &name does its work by workshop leader &name &name 
^ the purpose of story , as i see it , is to guide us to our full potential and the nature of story is to conceal that purpose in an enticing sugar coat ( the entertainment dimensions ) that lures us into the experience . 
^ but if the purpose is concealed , then how does it do its work ? 
^ the great story -- by which i mean the great myths , legends , fairy tales , classics , critical and box office successes -- does its work in several important ways : 
^ first , it stimulates our imaginations by provoking personal fantasies , which lead to the desire for actions in the real world . 
^ then it gives us a taste of what it might be like if we were actually to make &num of these passages and accomplish some of these things . 
^ &name &name explains it this way -- ' the auditor experiences some of the sensations but is not transformed . 
^ their imaginations are stimulated : they go home and through personal fantasies begin the process of transformation for themselves . ' all of this happens automatically and the story recipients need not be consciously aware that the story is intentionally trying to influence and guide them . 
^ having lured us into the adventure by fantasies and a taste , the great story then provides us with a road map , which is to say , it outlines all of the actions and tasks of the hero 's and anti-hero 's journey which we have to accomplish in order to complete &num of these passages . 
^ plus , it provides a tool kit for solving all of the problems that have to be solved to accomplish the actions and tasks . 
^ the tool kit , of course , is the problem solving story structures of which &name 's classical structure is a significant part . 
^ every great story will divulge a little more of this truth , and bit by bit each step of the passage is revealed . 
^ again , all of this is going on without the story recipients ' conscious knowledge that it 's happening . 
^ how does it do that ? 
^ by meaningful connections . 
^ if it 's a great story , we will remember it , and , over time , we will make meaningful associations and connections with our real life situations . 
^ the more hidden truth the story contains , the more appealing it will be ; the more relevant it will be to our lives and the more likely we are to remember it . 
^ we 'll cherish and work with it all of our lives , then we 'll pass it on to our children . 
^ no &num story , as i 've indicated , contains the whole truth . 
^ the process is cumulative . 
^ each story contributes a little bit of this vital information . 
^ we can be affected by many different stories at the same time . 
^ we relate them to our lives when , and if we need them and make the necessary course corrections . 
^ it was more than &num years from the time i first heard ' rumplestiltskin ' until i realized that the secrets hidden in that marvelous tale were about the creative process and how the mind is organized . 
^ in &name , and many stories like it , an endangered princess has to perform the impossible task of transforming a pile of straw into gold by morning or she 'll lose her head . 
^ then a miraculous helper , &name , comes to her rescue and accomplishes the task for her while she sleeps . 
^ being a writer , i would often fall asleep at night worrying about certain difficult story problems i had n't been able to solve during that work day . 
^ and just as often , a marvelous solution to those problems would pop into my head as i was waking up the following morning . 
^ naturally , i wondered who or what was solving those problems . 
^ suddenly , &num day i made the connection . 
^ 'my &name , ' i exclaimed . 
^ ' it 's rumplestiltskin ! ' 
^ the miraculous little helper was a metaphor , a personification in image form of some unconscious problem-solving mechanism . 
^ the secret hidden in the marvelous story had something important to reveal about the creative process and how our minds function . 
^ namely , that inside our minds there is an unconscious problem-solving mechanism ( a rumplestiltskin ) that continues to work , and transform our serious problems ( the straw ) into precious insights ( the gold ) , while our conscious minds are asleep . 
^ another little piece of the puzzle had been revealed . 
^ and , finally , the great story guides this whole process with incredible insights and wisdom . 
^ in ' a christmas &name , ' when the ghost of christmas future is showing &name his own tombstone , the kneeling , pathetic , nearly repentant &name asks him , ' are these things that will be or things that may be ? ' the answer to that question , and the point of the whole story , is that these are things that ' will be , ' if he does nothing , and things that 'may be , ' if he does something about it , if he repents and changes his character . 
^ if he changes his character , he will change his future . 
^ in other words , at any given moment we have a certain destiny . 
^ and , if we 're not content with that destiny , we can do something about it . 
^ &char &char can transform our futures by transforming ourselves . 
^ if we change who we are , if we awaken our humanity , we can change our destiny . 
^ that 's good news . 
^ believe it or not there 's something similar and equally profound in the movie ' back to the future . ' having seen ' back to the future , part &num , ' and having no desire to see part &num , i have concluded that the profundity in part i got there by accident , but nevertheless , it 's there . 
^ at the beginning of the story , we meet &name &name &name and his family . 
^ his mother is an alcoholic and his rather pathetic father a serious wimp and a miserable failure . 
^ they 're living in a hovel of mediocrity and despair . 
^ when &name &name &name gets involved in his time machine adventure , he gets entangled in the lives of his parents when they are still in high school , on the very day that they met . 
^ and they met in a curious way . 
^ his clumsy , painfully shy father was hit by a car in front of his mother 's house while lurking there , trying to catch a glimpse of her . 
^ the boy 's mother took him into her house to nurse him back to health and fell in love with him out of pity . 
^ when &name &name &name arrives a moment before the father , he is hit by the car , and his mother falls in love with him instead . 
^ he now has a very big problem . 
^ he has to make his future mother fall out of love with him and in love with his geeky , future father or he is n't even going to exist . 
^ he accomplishes this &num evening when his mother is being molested by the town bully in the front seat of a car . 
^ &name goads his father into rescuing her , in the process of which , the father knocks out the bully with a lucky punch and his mother is saved . 
^ the mother immediately transfers her love from her future son to her new hero . 
^ now , that in itself is profound because it says that a love inspired by heroic deeds is stronger than a love brought on by pity . 
^ but there 's more . 
^ when &name gets back to the present , everything about the lives of his family has miraculously changed . 
^ his mother is no longer an alcoholic , his father is a big success and a real dude , and they 're living in a magnificent , creatively appointed house -- all because of that &num change in the father 's character . 
^ the important bit of &name has to do with the incredible difference &num courageous act can make on our lives . 
^ standing up to that bully had an extraordinary and profound effect far into the future . 
^ we encounter numerous such challenges and opportunities to show our courage every day . 
^ the phone call we 're afraid to make to ask for a date or a job -- little acts of courage that could be profoundly and irrevocably changing the rest of our lives . 
^ that 's also very useful to know . 
^ &num final example . 
^ in a fairy tale called ' &name &name , ' a young hero on an important adventure stops to rest at a witch 's house . 
^ the witch tries to delay him by asking him some intriguing but difficult questions , like , ' what is truth ? ' 'does the universe ever end ? ' and so on . 
^ the wise young hero looks at her and says , 'shut up and get me something to eat . ' 
^ the wisdom in this story is simple enough : beware of imponderables when action is necessary . 
^ do n't wile away your days worrying about &name or other unanswerable questions when you should be out looking for a job . 
^ so there you have &num important bits of advice from stories : change yourself and you change your destiny ; little acts of courage performed today can have exponential effects on the rest of your life ; and beware of imponderables when action is necessary . 
^ and here again it 's cumulative , each story contributing a little bit more of the hidden truth . 
^ when you 've got hundreds such bits of wisdom working for you , all you have to do is get up in the morning and you 'll know exactly what to do and how to do it . 
^ so that 's how the great stories do their work . 
^ they stimulate our imaginations and give us little tastes of paradise . 
^ these trigger fantasies , which lead us to desires for actions in the real world . 
^ then , as we pursue these goals , the stories guide us through the passages using meaningful connections , each story revealing a little bit more of the truth .

^ part &num in a series : 
^ writing contests : valuable & inexpensive feedback plus marketing ! 
^ okay , let 's review your progress : you 've found your voice , honed your craft , and developed a body of work . 
^ how do you determine if you and your scripts are ready for the market ? 
^ you need feedback . 
^ it 's time to move beyond the opinions of your family and friends . 
^ what about classes and writer 's groups ? 
^ both of these sources can be helpful in providing feedback to a writer . 
^ however , in many cases , the feedback might be from writers whose skill level may not be as high as yours . 
^ and , in a classroom situation , the instructor may not be able to read each student 's script in its entirety . 
^ an inexpensive place to get feedback is through a screenwriting contest . 
^ nominal submission fees ( less than $ &num ) encourage you to enter your script in a number of contests . 
^ be selective . 
^ most contests , unless they indicate otherwise , are biased toward 'dramatic scripts about something . ' that trendy teen comedy , action-packed martial arts script or high-budgeted sci-fi adventure probably wo n't impress most contest judges , who are usually not interested in the commercial potential -- they are interested in terrific writing . 
^ &name the entry rules and the promotional materials about contests . 
^ some of the better contests for novice writers are those sponsored by film festivals or film commissions , or even writer 's groups . 
^ who are the judges , and how are the winners determined ? 
^ blue-ribbon judging panels are often producers , agents , development executives or writers . 
^ depending on the contest sponsor , they may be well-known professionals or absolute newcomers . 
^ each contest has its own system , but , in general , most contests have a systematic screening process , involving staff members , unpaid volunteers or interns before the best scripts reach the blue-ribbon panel . 
^ script finalists are usually read at least &num or more times . 
^ a few of the contests will give feedback , but that 's not a given . 
^ in fact , unless you pay for it , the usual feedback a writer receives is silence . 
^ if you do n't make it into the finals , semi-finals or quarter-finals of a contest , that 's a comment on your writing . 
^ but , if your script does well , then you have an ' advertisement ' when it comes time to market yourself and your script . 
^ ( i will write more on how to use contests as a marketing tool in a later column . ) 
^ what are some of the other sources for feedback ? 
^ should you pay for an evaluation ? 
^ these questions and more will be answered in part &num of this series .

^ letter to the editor : news you can use 
^ dear &name : 
^ just wanted to let you know how much i enjoyed the &name . 
^ the article [ by &name &name ] on outlining was dead-on . 
^ my writing partner and i wrote our first &num scripts without the benefit of an outline . 
^ since using them , we 've noticed we spend a lot more time talking about story , plot and character rather than worrying about descriptions and dialogue prematurely . 
^ it 's made an enormous difference in the execution of the script itself and in the rewrite process because you 're just redecorating or rearranging without demolishing the house . 
^ &char major plus is that people are very willing to read a &num or &num page outline that has a lot of white space -- so it 's easier to get that much needed feedback before you move forward . 
^ not to mention that , yes , it is much easier to move , cut or paste a few sentences from an outline rather than pages of a script . 
^ there 's always room for improvement - but , as aspiring professionals , it was nice to have this aspect of our method validated . 
^ best wishes , &name 
^ &name : it would be great to hear from the pros [ or other readers ] about their experience with writing partnerships . 
^ it seems everyone has a different method of working , and it would be interesting to hear about how other duos work together . 
^ dear &name : 
^ do write as part of a team ?
