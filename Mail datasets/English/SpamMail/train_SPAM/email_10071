' ^ (  ame '  ame  ame  ame  um  ame  ame library'  miley ( check out the online discussion on the multithreading capabilities miley  ebsite ^ personally , i do n't have a problem with the idea of starting up a hundred thousand separate threads in a matter of seconds . ^ when i 'm editing digital video in  ame 's  ame , i really appreciate the quiet way that the program renders titles and transitions in the background while i continue reviewing the segments in between those effects . ^ when i 'm researching an article , i appreciate the way that i can spin off background-loading tabbed panes in  ame to have hyperlinked materials ready for me to read when i finish an overview page . ^ can i imagine an application that actually needs  um thousand times that level of parallelism ? ^ well , as the new hummer  ame ads observe , ' ' need ' is a highly subjective word . ' ^ i can certainly imagine traffic management on large networks , or order picking in an automated warehouse , or any number of other tasks in which  ame dozens or grosses of threads would quickly become a noticeably shallow pool of programmer resources . ^ and maybe this seems self-indulgent , but when i 'm thinking about how to solve a problem i do n't want to waste my time counting--or force-fitting a problem into some arbitrary number of slots . ^ if i find the perfect solution , conceptually , i do n't want to discover that it wo n't work because it requires the machine to play ' too many notes ' ( as  ame 's emperor  ame  um famously admonished  ame ) . ^ ( learn more about the criteria for language  ame  ebsite ( find out more about  ame  ebsite ^ the only numbers that have any place in a computer , it 's been said , are  um ,  um and  ame . ^ there are things that we ca n't have at all ; there are things that it makes sense to allow in only  um unique instance at any time . ^ but if we can have more than one , we should be able to have any number , subject only to a reasonably gradual loss of performance as the finite resources of any real system are spread across more entities . ^ or perhaps the network should just deliver additional resources on demand : if the software can learn to request them , the universe can be built to provide them . ^ (  ame about the  ame  ame  ebsite (  ame '  ame  ame $  um billion on '  ame ' computing'  miley ^ at a  ame  ame conference a few years ago , a keynote speaker expressed concern that software had become harder to change than hardware . ^ the most fruitful path to higher performance , he said , was through processor architectures optimized for concurrent execution of multithreaded applications , if only software developers could learn to write code that took advantage of that potential . ^ ( check out  ame  ame  ame  ebsite (  ame about parallel computer  ame  ebsite ( find out how to convert from serial to parallel execution miley  ebsite ^ a key industry therefore , of languages like  ame or  ame with their built-in semantics for concurrency is that they increase developers ' inclination to think in concurrent terms . ^ the other requirement , though , is an application platform that can keep those threads untangled . ^ what we 're seeing from next-generation operating systems and networked on-demand computing schemes is a welcome attention to that kind of scalable growth . ^ tell me how many threads are enough : mailto :  mail ^ news ^  ame  ame its  ame distribution ^ in a
