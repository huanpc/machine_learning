^ this ! ! 
^ &num day , when i was a freshman in high school , 
^ i saw a kid from my class was walking home from school . 
^ his name was &name . 
^ it looked like he was carrying all of his books . 
^ i thought to myself , ' why would anyone bring home all his books on a friday ? 
^ he must really be a nerd . ' 
^ i had quite a weekend planned ( parties and a football game with my friends tomorrow afternoon ) , so i shrugged my shoulders and went on . 
^ as i was walking , i saw a bunch of kids running toward him . 
^ they ran at him , knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he landed in the dirt . 
^ his glasses went flying , and i saw them land in the grass about &num feet from him . 
^ he looked up and i saw this terrible sadness in his eyes . 
^ my heart went out to him . 
^ so , i jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses , and i saw a tear in his eye . 
^ as i handed him his glasses , i said,' those guys are jerks . 
^ they really should get lives . 
^ ' he looked at me and said , ' hey thanks ! ' 
^ there was a big smile on his face . 
^ it was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude . 
^ i helped him pick up his books , and asked him where he lived . 
^ as it turned out , he lived near me , so i asked him why i had never seen him before . 
^ he said he had gone to private school before now . 
^ i would have never hung out with a private school kid before . 
^ we talked all the way home , and i carried some of his books . 
^ he turned out to be a pretty cool kid . 
^ i asked him if he wanted to play a little football with my friends . 
^ he said yes . 
^ we hung out all weekend and the more i got to know &name , the more i liked him , and my friends thought the same of him . 
^ monday morning came , and there was &name with the huge stack of books again . 
^ i stopped him and said , ' &name , you are gonna really build some serious muscles with this pile of books everyday ! 
^ ' he just laughed and handed me half the books . 
^ over the next &num years , &name and i became best friends . 
^ when we were seniors , we began to think about college . 
^ &name decided on &name , and i was going to &name . 
^ i knew that we would always be friends , that the miles would never be a problem . 
^ he was going to be a doctor , and i was going for business on a football scholarship . 
^ &name was valedictorian of our class . 
^ i teased him all the time about being a nerd . 
^ he had to prepare a speech for graduation . 
^ i was so glad it was n't me having to get up there and speak . 
^ graduation day , i saw &name . 
^ he looked great . 
^ he was one of those guys that really found himself during high school . 
^ he filled out and actually looked good in glasses . 
^ he had more dates than i had and all the girls loved him . 
^ &name , sometimes i was jealous . 
^ today was one of those days . 
^ i could see that he was nervous about his speech . 
^ so , i smacked him on the back and said , ' hey , big guy , you 'll be great ! ' 
^ he looked at me with one of those looks ( the really grateful &num ) and smiled . 
^ ' thanks , ' he said . 
^ as he started his speech , he cleared his throat , and began . 
^ ' graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years . 
^ your parents , your teachers , your siblings , maybe a coach ... but mostly your friends . 
^ i am here to tell all of you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give them . 
^ i am going to tell you a story . ' 
^ i just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met . 
^ he had planned to kill himself over the weekend . 
^ he talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his mom would n't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home . 
^ he looked hard at me and gave me a little smile . 
^ ' &name , i was saved . 
^ my friend saved me from doing the unspeakable . ' 
^ i heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome , popular boy told us all about his weakest moment . 
^ i saw his mom and dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile . 
^ not until that moment did i realize it 's depth . 
^ never underestimate the power of your actions . 
^ with &num small gesture you can change a person 's life . 
^ for better or for worse . 
^ &name puts us all in each other 's lives to impact one another in some way . 
^ look for &name in others . 
^ you now have &num choices , you can : 
^ &num ) pass this on to your friends or 
^ &num ) delete it and act like it did n't touch your heart . 
^ as you can see , i took choice number &num . 
^ ' friends are 
^ angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have 
^ trouble remembering how to fly . ' 
^ there is no beginning or end .. yesterday is history . 
^ tomorrow is mystery . 
^ today is a gift . 
^ it 's national friendship week . 
^ show your friends
