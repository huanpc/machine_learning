^ dr. &name &name , managing director ( &name and &name ) african development &name ( &name ) &name . 
^ dear sir , 
^ i am dr. &name &name , managing director &name and &name dept. at the african development &name lagos . 
^ with due respect i have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be beneficial to both of us . 
^ at the bank 's last accounts / auditing evaluations , my staffs came across an old account , which was being maintained by a foreign client who we learnt was among the deceased passengers of an airline crash on the 6th of nov. &num . 
^ since the deceased was unable to run this account as a result of his death , the account has remained dormant without the knowledge of his family since the client put it in a safe deposit account in the bank for future investment . 
^ since his demise , nobody , not even the members of his family have applied for the claim of this fund , and it has been in the safe deposit account until we discovered that it cannot be claimed since our client is a foreign national and we are sure that he has no next of kin here to file claims over the money . 
^ as the managing director of the dept , this discovery was brought to my desk so as to decide what is to be done . 
^ with the few personnel in my dept. , we decided to seek ways through which to transfer this money out of the bank and out of the country too . 
^ the total amount in the account is ( &num million &num hundred thousand united states dollars only ) &website . 
^ with my position as the managing director of the bank , we are handicapped because the present code of conduct act of the bank makes it an offence for us to operate foreign account and cannot lay bonafide claim over this money . 
^ while we were contemplating on how to resolve this issue , a friend of mine who works with the &name chamber of commerce and industry recommended your personality to me and advised i should ask you for help , to transfer this money out of the country . 
^ the client is a foreign national and you will only be asked to act as his next of kin and &char will supply you with all the necessary informations and bank datas to assist you withstand the eligibility in transferring this money to your bank account or any safe place of your choice where this money can be successfully transferred to . 
^ &char and my partners have decided to give away &num &num ( &num ) of the total sum to you for your assistance and &num ( &num ) for any unforeseen expenses that might arise in the cause of transferring this money . 
^ we want to assure you that this transaction is absolutely risk free since we work in this bank , that is why you should be confident in the success of this transaction because you will be updated with information as at when desired . 
^ therefore , you are requested to keep this transaction absolutely confidential and secret as we are hoping to retire with our share of this money at the end of the successful transfer of this fund to your designated bank account in your country . 
^ we will then come over to your country for sharing according to the above stated percentage ratio . 
^ you are also to advise us on profitable ventures to invest our share of the fund . 
^ please for further information and enquiries feel free to contact me through my e-mail address . 
^ thanks and remain blessed . 
^ dr. &name &name .
