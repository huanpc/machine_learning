^ eum enespa&ntilde;ol emportugu&ecirc;s &name &name 
^ march &num , &num : &name &name , &name . 
^ march &num , &num : &name &name &name , &name ( translation from original in spanish ) . 
^ silenced truth : ' pacifists ' protect tyrants and incite wars 
^ history will record with severity the huge social , human and political cost of the activism of the erroneously named ' pacifists ' 
^ the so-called ' pacifist ' movements , articulated by leftists , and their silent accomplice , have decisively contributed to the protection of the most fierce tyrants of the xx and &name &name , since &name &name and &name , &name &name , &name pot and &name &name il , to &name &name . 
^ with their harmful political formula of ' giving in so as not to loose ' , they paved the way for several of those dictators to increment warmonger attitudes against countries and continents , in addition to enslaving their own people . 
^ towards the end of the &name it was the english and french ' pacifists ' who , with the pretext of avoiding war with &name , pressured the public opinion of their respective countries , to give-in before the annexation of &name in &name and other territories where german was spoken belonging to &name ( 'sudentenland ' ) , &name ( &name ' corridor ' ) , etc. those ' pacifists ' supported their respective heads of state , &name and &name , in their giving-in attitude before the german despot . 
^ it was not in vain when &name &name , the great english statesman , reprimanded &name by telling him : ' your choice was between shame and war ; you chose shame and you will have war ' . 
^ in fact , after so many shameful concessions , peaking with the &name pact , which legitimately recognized the usurpations of &name , it invaded &name , which led to the second world war , which had a toll of &num million deaths . 
^ during the decade of &num , the handing over by &name government of several southeast asian nations to communists -who unleashed indescribable massacres of millions of innocent civilians , such as in &name was in most part precipitated by pressures on behalf of ' pacifists ' . 
^ other historical examples could also be mentioned . 
^ during the present , the complex circumstances of war in &name do not impede us from pointing out similarities and censurable contradictions of &name ' pacifist ' movements that , with the pretext of condemning the war , lift up a smoke screen in front of the dictatorship of &name &name , in front of the conditions of misery and oppression of the &name people , in front of the danger which said regime represents to regional and international peace . 
^ as it has already been denounced , those ' pacifist ' manifestations which are spread throughout the world were previously articulated in the recent worldwide social forum of &name &name , a gigantic catalyst of revolutionary forces which survived communism . 
^ those same ' pacifists ' who cry only with the left eye , do not only keep silence as to the crimes of the &name dictatorial regime , but also as to the repressive onslaught unleashed recently by &name &name against oppositionists and independent journalists ; the cruelties of colombian narco-guerrillas ; the violations of political-religious rights in countries such as &name , &name and &name &name ; christian persecutions in muslim countries ; the &name despotism of the &name president &name ; the fratricidal violence of the &name , in &name , etc. 
^ it is symptomatic that in the &name &name entities that promote anti-war protests , such as ' &name &name party ' and ' answer ' their fa&ccedil;ade entity ( at a cost of an estimated &num thousand dollars per protest ) , have initiatives in their curriculum in support of &name 's &name , &name 's &name , and &name &name il 's &name &name , as demonstrated by the journalist &name &name , of &name &name . 
^ in &name , protests of the erroneously named ' pacifists ' resort to violence , attacking government party headquarters and causing much destruction to public property . 
^ according to a denouncement made in editorial of &name &name , in &name there is a resurgence of the ' jacobean traditional sectarianism ' , with ' violent methods ' used by the ' extreme totalitarian left ' who are counting on the support , through act or omission , of the &name &name and the spanish socialist workers party . 
^ in &name , &name &name , of the &name &name &name , in exile , denounced that the supposedly pro-peace activists want to ' prolong the life of &name and the misery of the &name people ' . 
^ in &name , journalist &name &name &name &name , in a front-page article in the ' corriere &name &name ' , calls attention to the enormous ' capacity ' of the so-called ' pacifists ' in that country to 'manipulate reality ' , using as an example the 'massive ' use in protests of pictures of the cuban-argentinean guerilla ' &name ' &name , who is being presented as a symbol of ' pacifism ' when in reality , his cruelty made him contrary to peace . 
^ as &name &name , another italian journalist , &name director of &name archdiocese , observed , ' pacifist ' italian leaders are guided by ' an ideology that only maintains pacifism in its name ' . 
^ after the emotional climate artificially created by the left ( with the collaboration of the media ) , that clouds reason and common sense , history will , without a doubt , record with severity and indignation the gigantic social , human and political cost of the erroneously named ' pacifists ' . 
^ the cause of peace is too important to leave it in their hands . 
^ lastly , it is important to not confuse the pacifists with the peaceful . 
^ &name &name promised to those last mentioned an admirable prize : ' you shall be named children of &name ' . 
^ the peaceful &num are those that love true peace , defined by &name &name as ' the tranquility of order ' . 
^ on the contrary , if the pacifists speak of peace it is as a pretext to fool and immobilize the peaceful , supporters of order .
