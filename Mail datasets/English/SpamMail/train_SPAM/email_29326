^ dear professor , my name is &name and i am with &name book &name services . 
^ it is my wish to assist you with any surplus ( unsolicited desk copies ) textbooks that you have received , which you no longer require , by purchasing them from you . 
^ i have been in the business of buying textbooks for the last &num years and can assure you the best possible service and professional courtesy . 
^ when textbooks are not used it is a complete loss of utility . 
^ is n't it better for students who ca n't afford to purchase new books to be given the opportunity to purchase used books , especially when that book may just sit on a shelf until a new edition is printed ? 
^ new editions change quickly and new information is not always added . 
^ by appointment only . 
^ please reply with your office hours or make an appointment . 
^ ( or reply with the isbn# of textbooks to receive a quote . ) 
^ &name regards 
^ &name who wish to be removed please type remove in the subject box , be sure it is the address that you wish removed . 
^ important point ! ! ! 
^ any loss of sales due to resale of complimentary copies is insignificant compared to publisher profits . 
^ this is an advertising expense and not a loss . 
^ advertising is a cost of doing business and is expensed as such . 
^ the complimentary copy issue 
^ desk copies are sent free of charge from publishers to professors for their review . 
^ the faculty is under no obligation to return these texts . 
^ publishers operate under the precept that no book will be selected by a professor for use in classrooms unless that professor has first seen the book and has had an opportunity to read and review it in detail . 
^ the theory is similar to one used by &name & gamble when they send out free samples of a mouthwash or toothpaste . 
^ it is an attempt to say ' try it , you 'll like it . ' these free copy books are viewed by the publisher as an advertising expense and charged against that portion of the printing that is to be sold . 
^ regardless of the final disposition of the books , the charge for them is still included in the selling price of the others . 
^ when the first printing of a book , say &num , &num copies is run by the printer , an additional &num , &num , &num copies are printed to be given away . 
^ these books are also used by the publishing industry as a tax write-off . 
^ ' is selling ethical ? ' 
^ this is not really an ethical question . 
^ the publishers are in this for the money . 
^ in the same way a car manufacturer prefers to sell only new cars , a publisher prefers to sell only new books ! 
^ publishers have developed an almost unbelievable method for evaluating the performance of their sales representatives . 
^ the reps review a sampling profile for each account which basically is no more than a computer listing of every book sent to each school . 
^ the home office determines which books have the most potential to be big sellers and they track these titles via the sampling profile . 
^ this is the background that sets up the following scenario . 
^ because of the ' tracking system ' , a professor can tell a sales representative as firmly as possible that he does not want to receive a copy of a particular book , and that book will still be sent . 
^ the reason this happens is because it is easier to send the book ( which has little value ) than it is to justify to management why the book should not be sent . 
^ ' is selling legal ? ' 
^ legal ? 
^ in a word , yes . 
^ these books are given to the professors with no strings attached . 
^ they fall into the same category as any ' free sample ' they are the property of the recipient and , as such , can be either used or disposed of in any manner that the recipient wishes . 
^ this email , and any files transmitted , is confidential and may contain privileged information . 
^ any unauthorized dissemination or copying is strictly prohibited . 
^ this footnote also confirms that this email message has been swept for the presence of computer viruses .
