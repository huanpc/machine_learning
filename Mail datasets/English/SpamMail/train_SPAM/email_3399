^ from &name &name &name auditing and accounting unit . 
^ foreign remittance dept . 
^ first bank of &name &name 
^ strictly confidential 
^ i am &name &name &name , the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of first bank of &name &name of &name with due respect and regards . 
^ i have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . 
^ during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on november &num in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development . 
^ although personally , i kept this information secret within myself and my partner to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful during the time of execution . 
^ the said amount was &name $ 31.5m ( &num &num million &num hundred &num united states dollars ) . 
^ i am glad to say that with the introduction of &name and website , i was opportuned and pleasured to have come across your contact through this satellite media . 
^ as it may interest you to know , meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased , get the required approval and transfer this money to a foriegn account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great business opportunity . 
^ in fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant , we are not allowed to operate a foriegn account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because , i work in this bank . 
^ this is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to this bank and also present a foriegn account where he will need the money to be retransfered into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by designation bank account . 
^ i will not fail to inform you that this transaction is &num risk free . 
^ on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to &num of the total sum as gratification , while &num will be set aside upon conclusion of the transaction to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer both local and international like telephone bills , e-mail bills include the documents fees , while &num will be for me and my partner . 
^ please , you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you . 
^ i will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account . 
^ and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment , either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. 
^ all other necessary information will be sent to you when i hear from you . 
^ i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal . 
^ yours faithfully , 
^ &name &name &name
