^ how to &name an income tax extension 
^ time is ticking down to april &num , the day your taxes must be filed by . 
^ or is it ? 
^ for some people , april &num comes and goes without fret . 
^ the reason is because of a little application form called form &num that allows taxpayers an extension of &num months in order to file taxes . 
^ if you do n't think you will be able to file your taxes by april &num , get a copy of form &num and mail it before april &num . 
^ regardless of whether you are filing form &num , form &num , or form 1040-ez , you can use form &num to move the due date back to august 15th . 
^ you may request form &num from the internal revenue service . 
^ the form is very easy to fill out and will just ask for your name , address and social security number . 
^ it also asks you to estimate your tax liability and send any balance due . 
^ form &num is an automatic extension and does n't require a reason for requesting an extension . 
^ if you still need additional time , you may request a second extension by filing form &num before the first extension expires . 
^ this extension gives you another &num months , until oct. &num , to file your return . 
^ the only difference between the first and second extension request is that you must provide an explanation of why you are filing for a second one . 
^ your reason for filing an extension must be approved by the &name . 
^ if your request for an extension is denied , the &name will allow you approximately &num days to submit your return . 
^ &num thing to remember is that an extension does not extend the date to pay your taxes , just the date for filing . 
^ many people get this confused and wind up owing interest and / or paying a penalty for late payment . 
^ the &name can charge you a late filing penalty of &num of the tax not paid by the due date for each month or part of a month your return is late . 
^ generally , the maximum penalty is &num . 
^ but , if your return is more than &num days late , the minimum penalty is $ &num or the balance of the tax due on your return , whichever is smaller . 
^ the late-payment penalty can be excused if you have and can show reasonable cause for not paying on time . 
^ you are considered to have reasonable cause if at least &num of your actual liability is paid before the regular due date of your return through withholding or estimated tax payments . 
^ as the old saying goes , better late than never !

^ assessing your property tax 
^ since we 've been talking about our income tax over the last month or so , taxes are fresh on the brain . 
^ &num of the biggest taxes we pay out is our property tax . 
^ have you ever assessed your property tax to make sure you are n't overpaying ? 
^ you may be doing so and not even realize it . 
^ according to the national &name &name , assessors overvalue roughly &num of homes . 
^ as a result , you can wind up paying more property tax than you should be . 
^ if an assessor overvalues a part of your house by mistake , it could cost you a lot more . 
^ we offer some helpful suggestions to educate you on what to look for and to help you avoid such mistakes . 
^ &name take a good look at your assessment in order to find potential mistakes . 
^ it helps to know the most common mistakes that appear on your assessment . 
^ start with the number of rooms , as well as the dimensions listed on the assessment . 
^ many times you may find the incorrect amount of rooms or the wrong room sizes listed . 
^ as a result , your home will become overvalued . 
^ such mistakes as square footage , number of rooms , or the size of a garage are common errors . 
^ act now if you feel your home is being overvalued , contact your local assessment office to dispute it . 
^ you may need to act very quickly , as many areas only offer up to &num days to contest an assessment , so do not hesitate . 
^ re-assessment if the assessor has made a mistake that is clear , contact the assessment office to get the change made . 
^ this is &num of the biggest mistakes one can make when getting the proper value of your home documented . 
^ you have every right to review your assessment , as well as to contest anything listed on it , so take advantage of it if necessary . 
^ when pertaining to obvious mistakes , the assessment office will make the change , and may not be required to re-assess your home . 
^ true value an excellent way to get a good feel on the value of your home is by speaking to your neighbors who have similar homes . 
^ if possible , strike up a conversation about property taxes and see if they divulge what they are paying per year . 
^ the chances are good that the value of their home is very comparable to your home , give or take a few additions . 
^ appeal if you are having a hard time proving the value of your home to the assessors , you have other options . 
^ &num way is to approach the appeals board to state your case , explaining why the assessment is inaccurate .
