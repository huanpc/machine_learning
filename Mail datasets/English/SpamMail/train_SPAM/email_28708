^ - ---------------- preparing for a potential layoff ------------------ 
^ create a portfolio 
^ &num of the biggest problems that laid-off workers face is the realization that they do n't have any examples of recent work to show prospective employers . 
^ presentations , speeches , writing samples , performance reviews , complimentary letters written by your supervisor or others in the company -- these can all be gathered to form an impressive portfolio . 
^ but if you 're laid off , you may not get the chance to retrieve these documents off your computer . 
^ the solution : if you suspect layoffs are coming , begin gathering copies of the work you are most proud of . 
^ an important note : do not put anything in your portfolio that could expose you to legal trouble . 
^ private company information and data , for instance , are usually confidential and cannot be used in a portfolio . 
^ if you are unsure if a piece of your work is confidential or not , err on the side of caution and do n't include it .
