^ leap of &name 
^ dear yourself to a tranquil lagoon on a lazy afternoon . 
^ dragonflies zip . 
^ branches rustle in the slow breeze . 
^ and out of the corner of your eye , a spotted frog looks back with an unblinking stare . 
^ one webbed foot reaches stealthily in your direction . 
^ the other bends back as if it were a slingshot taking aim . 
^ call it crazy , but you 're certain this amphibious creature is speaking your language . 
^ &name &name 's bronze frogs &website 
^ such is the goal of artist &name &name ( a.k.a. the &name ) , the english-born sculptor behind a line of coveted limited edition bronze frogs . 
^ people always ask me which frogs inspire my creations , but you 'll never see these frogs in nature , says &name . 
^ these frogs live in my head . 
^ i 've given them human characteristics and that 's what captures the imagination . 
^ &char self-taught sculptor who spent his teen years working on cars and motorbikes , &name begins each frog by making a welded wire frame . 
^ the captivating poses are more human than amphibian , such as the surreptitiously extended leg show here on &name and &name frog . 
^ &name &name &name and &name &name bronze &website 
^ the tension that the artist infuses into each of the postures is a large part of what makes them so compelling . 
^ once he has successfully translated the frog in his head to the wire sculpture in his hands , he uses bondo , a filler normally used on cars , to finish the form . 
^ though most artists use clay , &name prefers this throwback from his automotive past for its silky smooth quality when hardened .

^ from this master , a mold is created using the lost wax technique . 
^ the ceramic mold is then used by master craftsman to create each bronze frog . 
^ every step is extremely labor intensive , explains the artist . 
^ from pouring the molten bronze to polishing the rough frogs , everything must be done by hand .

^ finishing the frogs is a combination of art , science and whimsy . 
^ &name uses patinas ( whose ingredients he secretively refers to as a special mix ) , which are applied with a brush or spray bottle equipped with an adjustable nozzle . 
^ the result is a super-glossy , jewel-like finish that adds a surprising elegance and sophistication to the whimsical sculptures' even when executed in surprising colors . 
^ i started out doing all green , says &name . 
^ but we started getting requests for other colors . 
^ our bestseller was bright blue . 
^ i did n't like it at the time , but we sold out within a year . 
^ &name &name &name bronze frogs &website 
^ when &name first began selling the frogs at street fairs in the early &num , he limited each design to &num pieces . 
^ but the frogs soon became so popular that he was forced to increase production . 
^ he now produces &num , &num per edition and designs &num new frogs each year . 
^ since those early days , his frogs have leapt into the homes of such celebrities as &name &name , &name &name and &name &name .
