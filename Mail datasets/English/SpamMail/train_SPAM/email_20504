^ why the time is right for certification by &name &name 
^ dear &char : 
^ despite a down economy and a dismal employment picture , it professionals still continue to find certification worthwhile . 
^ recent salary and employment surveys from &name &name , &name magazine , and &name &name all attest to the enduring value of certification , both in terms of pay and in terms of landing jobs . 
^ while obtaining certification is no guarantee of better employment or finding a job , it certainly does n't hurt , and higher rates of pay continue to apply to those who obtain it certification , especially high-demand credentials . 
^ on &name &num , &num , &name released the details of its requirements for &name &name &num exams for &name and &name candidates , and upgrade requirements for mcsas and mcses certified on &name &num . 
^ the broad outlines of the &num programs remain the same&# &name exams for &name , &num exams for &name 8212;but for both credentials , the number of valid elective exams is greatly reduced . 
^ in addition , those pursuing &name on &name &num will have to take &num core exams and a single elective ( an additional networking system core exam has been added to the &num required for the windows &num &name ) . 
^ on the upgrade front , mcsas on &name &num must take a single upgrade exam ( &num ) and mcses must take &num upgrade exams ( &num and &num ) ; both exams will be of normal length and difficulty according to &name , which makes this path easier for individuals to follow , and for test centers to administer . 
^ it looks like &name has finally come up with a reasonably rational certification upgrade path .
