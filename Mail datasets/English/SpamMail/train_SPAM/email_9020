^ phone no - &num fax-234-1-7598833 email-- sir , 
^ business proposal 
^ we represent the members of the tender board of the federal ministry of works and housing , &name . 
^ we awarded the contract for the provision of &name lights in the federal capital territory of &name , &name in &num . 
^ the contract was over-invoiced to the tune of $ &num million . 
^ the contract was actually completed at the cost of $ &num million . 
^ however , the balance $ &num million is presently in a suspense account in the &name bank of &name . 
^ we hope to transfer this amount to a trusted foreign partner , who is willing to assist us to get the money out of &name to an account abroad . 
^ it is relevant to state that we are civil servants in the ministry and it is unlawful for us to have such a huge amount of money in our bank account in &name ; hence we are seeking for a trusted foreign partner overseas , with a foreign account that can help us to get this money out of &name . 
^ it is a known fact that there are lots of stories about scam business in 
^ &name . 
^ this could be seen in a lot of business letters and e-mail and fax messages they send to people abroad . 
^ this is rather unfortunate . 
^ the government of &name is really doing its best to eliminate the scam business . 
^ however this , we have to assure you that ours is real and genuine . 
^ it is risk-free . 
^ in addition , we do not want to sound too greedy in this transaction , therefore we expect you to use your discretion to decide the sharing of the money based on percentages . 
^ in view of the above , we would be glad if you could give us your co- operation , by consenting to our desires . 
^ we look forward to your response as soon as possible . 
^ yours truly , 
^ dr. &name bello director of operations federal ministry of works and housing
