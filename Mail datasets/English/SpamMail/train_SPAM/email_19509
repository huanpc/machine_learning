^ &name &name big play . 
^ our trademark is our uncanny ability to spot stocks that have bottomed-out and anticipate their rebound and upward trend . 
^ most of the stocks we track rebound and peak within just &num days , giving investors opportunity to make a few bucks back in such a highly volatile market . 
^ we do n't believe the market is such as to take any long-term positions right now . 
^ but in a highly unstable marketplace , the opportunities for short-term stabs ( gains ) are abundant . 
^ when the question today seems to be which way is up , we like to think that from the bottom there is no other way---it 's all a matter of timing .
