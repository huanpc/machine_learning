^ upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . 
^ after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. &name &name has since died from an automobile accident . 
^ on further investigation , i found out that he did not leave &char will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless . 
^ i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. &name &name did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork . 
^ this sum of us $ &num , &num , &num is still sitting in the &name and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . 
^ no one will come forward to claim it . 
^ according to the nigerian law , at the expiration of &num ( &num ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the funds . 
^ consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr. &name &name so that the fruits of this old man 's labour will not get into the hands of some undeserving and corrupt officials . 
^ this is simple , i will like you to provide me immediately with the following ; your full names , date and place of birth and complete address with confidential telephone and fax numbers so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits , which will put you in place as the next of kin . 
^ we shall employ the services of &num attorneys for drafting and notarization of the will and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor for the transfer . 
^ &char bank account in any part of the world , which you would provide , will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin . 
^ the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of &num for me and &num for you . 
^ there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the &name manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . 
^ if you are interested , upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand . 
^ please observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country .
