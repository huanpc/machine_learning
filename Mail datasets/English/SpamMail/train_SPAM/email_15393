^ sky surfer &char / &char &name 
^ &char the fun , easy-to-fly spirit of the &name &name airplane , we recently introduced the sky surfer paraplane . 
^ perhaps the most remarkable thing about the sky surfer is not that it 's a paraplane , but that it has zippy climb performance and handling that , until now , has largely been missing from &char / &char paraplanes . 
^ &name to spare : the sky surfer 's &name &num motor geardrive and composite propeller make a potent combination that provide enough ' oomph ' to allow rolling takeoffs , in addition to the normal hand-launch technique . 
^ climb performance is spirited as well . 
^ &name speeds are in the very manageable &num mph range , thanks to the excess power of the &name that lets you throttle back to half power for maintaining level flight . 
^ the sky surfer 's sophisticated patented steering system allows positive and precise control during lots of maneuvers . 
^ we were able to slalom around obstacles , execute tight spirals up and down , thermal , pylon race , and shoot precise touch-and-go 's with complete control authority . 
^ the sky surfer 's combination of manageable speed and positive control should make it a favorite for beginners , since it practically assures a successful start and will soothe some of the butterflies most first timers feel as they learn to control an &char / &char aircraft . 
^ included are a 2-channel &name , a snap-together gondloa , a parafoil with preattached shroud lines , running hardware , a &name &name battery pack , and a 30-minute &name fast charger .

^ &name &name &name &name 
^ the fully assembled and ready-to-race &name &name is a 30-inch long , twin-motor , electric ocean racer loaded with full- race features from stem to stern . 
^ every design feature found on this model was put there for &num reason-to make it go faster ! 
^ we started with a modified &char &name design featuring multiple planing strakes for breaking up water surface tension . 
^ surface tension is the biggest drag-causing factor on any race boat , and the &name &name 's planing strakes are placed at several points on the &name 's bottom to defeat this speed-robbing phenomenon . 
^ as &char result-this boat literally flies over the water 's surface . 
^ motivating this hull are twin &num motors bolted up to a &num : &num drive-ratio transmission , which in turn drives a single heavy-duty main shaft and large surface-drive prop ( no toy-like under-water drive found here ) . 
^ surface-drive setups are the pinnacle racing technology all the way . 
^ they are also the mechanism responsible for creating those huge rooster tails so closely associated with competition boat racing , and guaranteed to excite any onlookers . 
^ mounted off the transom is a 'strutter-design ' rudder control . 
^ again , a feature only found on racing boats . 
^ rounding out this competition package is the copper plumbed , ( not aluminum ) ' &name ' forced-water cooling system . 
^ this system features water-jacketing around the commutator ends of the twin motors keeping things cool and running at optimum output efficiency . 
^ exiting cooling water can be seen streaming out of the model 's portside freeboard-very cool . 
^ &name &name also comes with installed high performance competition speed control and pistol- grip radio .

^ &name 's digital circuitry provides fully proportional throttle control and smooth , efficient operation ( no one else has it ! ) . 
^ the steerable outdrive and surface piercing prop work together with the specially designed hull to keep blast on a solid course , even during the most radical wave thrashing . 
^ it 's exciting action in a swimming pool and powerful fun on the open water . 
^ ready to run ! 
^ best of all , the blast is fully-assembled and ready-to-run with the radio systems and electronic speed control installed .
