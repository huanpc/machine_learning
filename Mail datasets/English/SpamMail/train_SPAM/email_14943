^ from : mr. &name &name south &name &name , 
^ you may be surprised to receive this letter since you dont know me personally i am mr. &name &name the son of &name &name . 
^ i got your contact through &name &name information &name ( &name &char ) here in &name and i decided to write for an assistance . 
^ my late father , was among the few black &name rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president &name &name . 
^ for his alleged support and sympathy for the &name opposition party controlled by the whites . 
^ before his death , he had taken me to &name to deposit the sum of us $ &num million ( &num million united state dollars ) with a security and finance company as if he foresaw the looming danger in &name . 
^ the money was deposited in a box as a consignment , to the security company to avoid seizure , and also to avoid much demurrage from the security company . 
^ this money was my fathers life savings throughout his over &num years in active farming activities . 
^ this land problem arose when president &name &name introduced a new land act , which wholly affected the rich farmers , and some few blacks eventually vehemently condemned the modus operandi adopted by the government . 
^ and that resulted to rampant killing and mob actions by the veterans and some political thugs , precisely , more than &num ( &num ) people have been killed . 
^ heads of government from &name &name , especially &name and united states of &name have voiced their condemnation of &name plan ubsequently , the south african development community ( &name &char ) has continuously supported &name new land reform act . 
^ it is against this background that i and my family who are currently staying in &name &name have decided to transfer my fathers money into a foreign account . 
^ as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking an account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who had tactically freezing our family wealth and &name african government seems to be playing along side with them . 
^ we have decided not to invest this money in &name &name for the fear of seizure and encountering the same experience in future , since both countries have almost the same political history . 
^ more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence i am an asylum seeker . 
^ as a businessman i should entrust my future and that of my family on his hands , i should let you know that this transaction is risk free . 
^ therefore if you accept to assist my family , we are willing to offer you &num of the total fund while &num will be set aside for any expencis that will incure in the process of the transaction , and &num will be my family investment in your country . 
^ we can as well go into partnership business with you.please reply immediately to facilitate immediate action toward the transaction , remember this business is highly confidential and shall be kept within you alone . 
^ best 
^ are you an &name fundi ? 
^ &name big prizes in our &name challenge !
