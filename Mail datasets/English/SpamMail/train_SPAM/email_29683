^ &num editors corner : 
^ * ok , so how 's &name &name ? 
^ well , since the code has now gone gold , we decided to take a look . 
^ it 's actually the best windows code to come out of the gate . 
^ its performance is indeed better , there are again better management tools and &name is maturing rapidly . 
^ this is actually a version you can look forward to , especially since it now comes out of the box being paranoid with everything locked down . 
^ you need to ' open it up ' and make it trusting , which is a &num degree change from how it used to be . 
^ obviously i 'm not saying you should take this into production right away . 
^ create a testbed of power users that can handle some downtime without flinching . 
^ and a good thing is to wait for &name , which i expect roughly fall &num . 
^ i looked at it in a role of domain controller but also app server , and it was tested both on new machines and upgrades . 
^ no serious problems were encountered . 
^ &char small hint is that you need to reduce your amount of domain controllers as much as possible before you upgrade , to reduce the number of failure points . 
^ the new built-in system resource management snaps into the &name and provides you with a highly granular process management that feels like the old &name or &name days . 
^ the pricing is created in such a way that you can just buy what you need . 
^ the &name enterprise edition with &num client licenses is $ &num , &num ; the &name edition with &num &name is $ &num , &num ; and the web-server only edition is just $ &num .

^ &name came out with some interesting statistics this week . 
^ the number of computer security incidents and attacks detected at businesses worldwide soared by &num percent between the fourth quarter of &num and the first quarter of this year , fueled in part by a surge in the number of mass-mailing worms .

^ * w2k server been discontinued ? 
^ a reader in &name &name received this message from their &name reseller . 
^ they had received this from &name locally . 
^ ' windows &num server has been discontinued . 
^ on &num march &name announced that &name &num server , &name &num &name , &name &num terminal services &name and &name &num &name connectors were to be discontinued as of &num april &num . 
^ if you require windows &num server / &name etc. they can purchase &name &name &num instead and downgrade to &num . 
^ they can do this without relinquishing the rights to &name &name &num so they can install this version whenever they like . 
^ &name kits for &name &name &num are expected to be available on &num april . ' 
^ we got a bit mystified , and asked &name for clarification . 
^ this is their answer : 
^ ' although a number of the windows &num &name &name came off the april &name book there is still , &name &num &name ' licenses and &name ' available . 
^ there is no ' official ' notice in such things . 
^ if a customer wants to buy windows &num server licenses they can , by purchasing the windows &num license which is cheaper and then use the downgrade rights to get windows &num . 
^ once they use windows &num ( by ordering the media still available on the price list if they do n't already have it ) then the windows &num &name and rights come into effect so they are not disadvantaged in any way . 
^ to the contrary in fact as the customer then also has rights to change up to &name &num when they wish . 
^ my comment : &name so it has not been discontinued , but you cannot buy it anymore . 
^ [ grin ] 
^ * what &name did not tell us about &name 
^ &name is becoming less and less talkative about exactly how it will deliver and price all of the elements that will comprise the ' windows platform ' . 
^ the &name watch site has a good item here , that we should keep in mind . 
^ link to the site at the end of this article . 
^ last year , &name execs talked about its plan to make a variety of layered services part of ' the windows platform . ' a number of journalists interpreted this as meaning these layered services would be delivered separately on &name and via &name &name this year , but folded into &name , over time . 
^ &name did nothing to correct their impressions on this . 
^ but increasingly , it is looking as if &name is planning to deliver the myriad windows 'services ' that it is building to run atop &name server as standalone servers that never will be rolled into the &name &name base . 
^ during a recent teleconference , &name execs declined to answer questions about how &name would package and price its layered services . 
^ they confirmed that &name is planning to roll out most of its add-on services within the next &num to &num days , but they refused to say more . 
^ a number of these 'services ' are elements that the &name of old would have been quick ( and more than happy ) to integrate into the ever-growing windows operating system . 
^ these include : 
^ - &name &name &name &name services ( code-named ' &name ' ) 
^ - &name rights management services ( code-named ' tungsten ' ) 
^ - &name &name services ( team collaboration services , formerly known as sharepoint portal services ) 
^ - &name &name &name services ( &name is categorizing this as a value-added ' tool ' for &name &name ) 
^ when pressed , a &name spokeswoman provided a bit more info : ' these features are not core to the &name and not needed by all customers . 
^ that is why we are delivering these components out of band . 
^ this is all we know right &name think some of the plans are still &name ( to be determined ) . ' &website 
^ * &name code leaks onto &name 
^ &name &name &num keys have 'sprung from the bag ' . 
^ &name confirmed that a code for installing and activating &name &name &num has leaked onto the &name . 
^ they have unleashed the hounds to hunt down the code -- they 're afraid pirates could get hold of it and start counterfeiting away . 
^ company officials think a &name corporate customer is responsible for the leak . 
^ &name over at c|net : &website 
^ * &name : beware of bogus bulletins 
^ in an otherwise light week for infrastructure security news , &name issued a reminder to customers to beware of bogus security bulletins that look like they come from &name . 
^ this is something you might want to remind your end-users of ! 
^ &name more at &name : &website 
^ * is &name going to ' netware ' &name and overture ? 
^ to ' netware ' is a verb i just coined , meaning to make it irrelevant . 
^ ok , ok , i know a lot of you are still running netware , and it 's actually great technology , but you know what happened to novell . 
^ &name , novell is actually porting netware to &name , did you know ? 
^ here is the link to the story : &website 
^ anyway , &name is significantly increasing their investment in &name search technology . 
^ they have tripled their search team and are preparing their own paid listings platform , according to a report from industry analysts . 
^ this would compete directly with outfits like overture and &name that provide this kind of service . 
^ the funny thing is that &name &name , former &name of novell is now &name of &name . 
^ is the writing on the wall for &name . 
^ .

^ pc world just compared the anti-spam market leaders . 
^ they gave &name for outlook a whopping &num stars and awarded it as &name &name with their best &name &name , with &num percent spam caught . 
^ here is what they said : 'sunbelt is the only antispam vendor that offers toll-free phone support ; we called and were connected with a human immediately .

^ if you are interested in &name &name &name , here is some ammo for your management . 
^ san &name &name research inc. , a high-tech consultancy specializing in e-mail and communications , which found that in &num , junk mail accounted for &num to &num percent of inbound corporate e-mail , and dealing with it will cost &name organizations $ 10-billion ( &name ) , up from $ 9-billion last year . 
^ &char &name spokesman later explained that the average corporate e-mail user receives &num or &num spam messages each day , spends an average of &num seconds on each one , and costs the company an average of $ &num a month to dump it . 
^ over time , the &name spokesman said , these figures add up . 
^ &name arrived at the $ 10-billion figure by calculating such things as the cost of computing resources , time spent by the e-mail admin and help-desk personnel and lost productivity . 
^ check the specs on &name &name edition here , we have just added a bunch of screenshots that ' open the kimono ' : &website 
^ * how to &name your help desk support calls by &num 
^ a lot of the time , help desk support people get confronted with very simple questions to do with logging on , passwords , and things that seemingly 'do not work ' .

^ &name fits the bill on both counts . ' 
^ &name allows you to automate logon , logoff and shutdown scripting , install / update software packages , create outlook mail profiles , create / remove shortcuts , enforce security policies and much more .

^ * lawyers lie in wait for &name &name 
^ attorneys nationwide reportedly plan to deploy &name patients at health care organizations to see if doctors , dentists , hospitals and insurance companies have the policies , procedures and protections that ensure patients ' privacy , as required by the federal health &name &name and &name act ( &name ) . 
^ the long-awaited privacy rule goes into effect monday . 
^ health care organizations that do n't comply risk hefty fines , possible criminal prosecution and costly civil lawsuits . 
^ companies have had &num years to educate staff , designate a privacy officer and adopt basic security measures . 
^ but there 's a good chance some providers will miss the deadline . 
^ the threat of lawsuits may be a stronger motivator than government fines or jail time , says &name &name , a security consultant and president of the &name group in &name . 
^ ' the government has publicly stated it will be very forgiving if an organization demonstrates it meant well and has taken steps to become compliant , ' &name says . 
^ while most of the privacy rule revolves around policy and procedure , it does outline some mandatory security measures . 
^ another &name component , the transactions and code rule , includes requirements for using aes-strength encryption for any electronic data transmissions , such as claims sent between medical providers and insurance companies .
