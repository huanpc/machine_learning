^ dear sir / madam 
^ you may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . 
^ for the purpose of introduction , i am mr. &name &name , the son of dr. &name &name , a wealthy farmer / politician in &name who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country . 
^ i got your contact through the internet based on our urgent need for a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner . 
^ hence i decided to write to you . 
^ before the death of my late father , he had taken me to &name to deposit the sum total of us $ &num million ( &num million , &num hundred thousand united &name dollars ) , in &num of the private security companies , as he foresaw the looming danger in &name . 
^ this money was deposited in &num boxes as &name treasures to avoid much demurrage from the security company . 
^ this amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in &name . 
^ the land problem , in our country came when our president mr. &name &name in a bid to win his re-election , introduced a new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers who are members of the opposition party . 
^ this resulted in killings and mob action by &name war veterans and some lunatics in the society . 
^ a lot of people have been killed because of this land reform act for which my father was unfortunately &num of the victims . 
^ it is against this background that , i and my family fled &name our capital for fear of our lives and are currently staying in a remote country side of &name . 
^ we are planning to leave the country and seek political asylum in &name and we have decided to move our family wealth to &name . 
^ as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine partner that could assist us without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got , and the south african government seems to be playing along with them . 
^ i am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of &name &name for fear of going through the same experience in future , since both countries have similar political history . 
^ i am now seeking for a partner whom i have to entrust my future and that of my family in his / her hands . 
^ to this end , we need your assistance to stand as the beneficiary of the consignments in &name . 
^ this is because we are under restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for . 
^ i have a sufficient contact person at the security company in &name &name who can help us move this money to &name under diplomatic cover to another security company in &name with your details as the beneficiary . 
^ this is &num legal and will not pass through normal customs / airport screening . 
^ thus , if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out of &name &name , you can contact me through my email addresses , &name no. above with your telephone , fax number and personal information to enable us discuss further details . 
^ i must let you know that this transaction is risk free as far as we keep it as confidential as possible . 
^ thank you , many blessings to you . 
^ yours faithfully , 
^ mr. &name &name .
