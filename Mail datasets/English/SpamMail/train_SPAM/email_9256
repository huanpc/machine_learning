^ dear sir , 
^ i am mr. &name &name , &name manager of metropolitan &name &name , lagos &name . 
^ i have an urgent and very business proposal for you . 
^ i got your from the &name trade center ( &name &char ) regional office in lagos , &name although the details of my intention was not made known to them . 
^ on june &num &num an american oil with the &name &name petrol mr. &name &name made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for &num calendar months valued at us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num million &num hundred thousand dollars ) in my branch . 
^ upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . 
^ after a month , we sent another reminder and finally from his employers &name national petroleum that mr. &name &name died from automobile accident . 
^ on further investigation , i found out that he did not leave any will and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless . 
^ i therefore made further investigation and that mr. &name did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paper work . 
^ this sum &name , &num , &num are still sitting in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . 
^ no one will forward to claim it . 
^ to the &name &name &name degree &num , at the expiration of &num ( &num ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of &name government if no body applies to claim the funds . 
^ my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to mr. &name &name so that the fruits of this old man ? 
^ &char labor will not get into the hands of some government officials . 
^ this simple : i will like you to provide me quickly with full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits , which will put you as the next of kin and we will be able to make claims . 
^ expecting your quick , positive and sincere response . 
^ many thanks 
^ mr. &name &name
