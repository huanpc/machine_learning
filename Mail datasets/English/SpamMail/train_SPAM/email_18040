^ eat right every day eating right should n't be painful--it should be delicious ! 
^ here are some simple ways to incorporate good habits into your everyday routines . 
^ creative seasoning . 
^ instead of reaching for the sour cream or the block of cheese when something needs a flavor boost , acquaint yourself with a wider array of flavorful , low-calorie ingredients . 
^ there are all kinds of vinegars , not to mention citrus juice and zest . 
^ add richness without adding fat by saut' ing or roasting your vegetables at high heat , rather than just steaming them . 
^ if the spices and herbs you use most are more than a year old , toss them out and start with fresh &num . 
^ while you 're at it , coax maximum flavor out of your spices right before adding them to your recipe by toasting them in a saute pan over medium heat until fragrant . 
^ do n't go hungry . 
^ gritting your teeth while hunger pangs gnaw is a good way to fail at a new eating plan . 
^ it 's okay to eat between meals as long as you account for your snacks in your total daily intake . 
^ vegetables , whole grain crackers , or baked tortilla chips with bean dip , hummus or salsa will satisfy you with filling fiber and gratifying crunch . 
^ air-popped popcorn sprinkled with your favorite spice mixture or powdered salad dressing mix is anything but boring . 
^ keep a variety of frozen fruit on hand so you can whip up a smoothie anytime : throw the fruit into the blender with some yogurt , milk , silken tofu and / or fruit juice . 
^ flavor it with drizzle of honey or chocolate syrup , or a sprinkle of cinnamon or vanilla extract . 
^ nutrition is for everyone . 
^ nobody is too young to eat healthfully . 
^ children do need more fat than adults to ensure healthy physical development , but nobody needs junk food . 
^ you 'll also be doing yourself a favor by removing the constant temptation of the cookies , chips , ice cream , and packaged snacks you might keep around ' for the kids . ' do n't let the family think of it as deprivation--think of it as expanding your horizons . 
^ get everyone excited about the adventures to be had in discovering new ingredients , snacks and dishes . 
^ resolve to try a new fruit , vegetable or spice every week ! 
^ lighten up your favorite foods after-school snacks that everyone can agree on eat your vegetables !
