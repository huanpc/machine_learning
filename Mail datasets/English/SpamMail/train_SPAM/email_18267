^ dear bank savings of late &name . 
^ david is to inform you of our desire to locate the relatives of the aformentioned person who until his gruesome murder was a prominent tobacco farmer in &name and a very reputable customer of this bank . 
^ he was reported to have been shot dead last year after being besieged on his farm here in &name , &name by the supporters of president &name &name 's new land act reform because of his attempt to breach the government compulsory land acquisition order , known as a section &num , enacted last year which authorizes the seizure of lands owned by white farmers in &name . 
^ i am writing to you particularly and privately because of our fruitless efforts to locate the true relatives of the diseased to inform you of this tragic incident and also the resolution of the management of this bank to redirect his bank savings as abandoned if nobody calls for it within the next &num bank working days since efforts to trace his true relatives have proven abortive as he did not provide information of his next of kin at the time the bank savings account was set up . 
^ hence , my personal desire to quietly have you as his true next of kin in this regards for our mutual benefit and to avoid redirection of funds as abandoned . 
^ the deal in brief is that , i shall be fronting for you to effect the swift transfer of the funds in your names ( as true next of kin ) and to your designated bank account and all that would be required of you is simply to open a new bank account in a reputable bank as would be recommended for the purpose of this transaction only which would enable us actualize the payment in abscential . 
^ considering the obvious circumstances of this transaction , there would be need for a meeting for more acquaintancy with each other and for a better understanding of this transaction prior to the release of funds to you . 
^ this meeting would allow utmost trust and confidence during which the deeds of &name stating the general terms and conditions of the entire transaction as regards the disbursement of funds as well as protecting the interest of both parties would be officially endorsed . 
^ this is important because of the magnitude of funds that is involved and since we have neither met nor known each other before . 
^ kindly indicate your acceptance of this proposal by a prompt response to enable me proceed with other arrangements to actualise this transaction . 
^ thanking you in anticipation of a lasting business relationship with you . 
^ respectfully submitted , mr. &name &name . 
^ &name &name &name , &name &name &name , 1st floor , first mutual &name building , &name &name street / 9th avenue , &name , &name .
