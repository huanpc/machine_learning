^ why search engine traffic should be your &name &name by &name &name ( &char ) &num 
^ most &name marketing methods are risky and many will not have any affect on traffic to a web site . 
^ some online marketers will sell you anything from banner impressions , to mass email campaigns ( spam ) , to popup ads . 
^ all these marketing tools can work , but they are also extremely risky . 
^ some people i know find pop-ups and spam so annoying that they will never purchase anything from a business that uses them . 
^ these plans are probably not the best customer acquisition strategies , and more likely they are a total waste of money . 
^ so why would anyone bother risking money on marketing strategies that probably will not increase traffic to your website ? 
^ why not concentrate on what does work ? 
^ - the search engines .

^ ( ... ) ' 
^ have you ever received one , and wondered why they were contacting you ? 
^ first off , how did they find your web site ? 
^ what search engines are they referring to ? 
^ if they really could deliver on their promise , then they would have so much repeat , and word of mouth business , that they would n't have time to be calling or emailing you . 
^ lastly , how many people actually believe that there are &num , &num search engines ? 
^ while it 's true you need traffic from the search engines , you do n't need to use spam techniques to get it . 
^ you need real results , and not false hope . 
^ increase web site traffic , .. naturally 
^ it is true that the best way to obtain lots of targeted traffic ( customers ) is to acquire it based on relevance , via the search engines . 
^ various studies show that anywhere from &num to &num of first time visitors to a web site find it through the search engines . 
^ that 's an incredible statistic . 
^ if you are not acquiring those customers as a result of a relevant query , then they will be disappointed . 
^ they may be disappointed with the search result , but more likely , they will be disappointed with your web site . 
^ in the online world that 's your first impression . 
^ we all know how important a first impression is . 
^ you can never get a bad one back , and a good one will carry you a long way . 
^ you have to make sure that the search engines are sending you visitors that are looking for your products or services . 
^ if your web site matches their interests , they will remember it , and come back , even if they do not make a purchase on that visit . 
^ if they find it irrelevant , they may have subconsciously formed a negative opinion of your online business , through no fault of your own . 
^ &num easy steps to raise your site ranking 
^ &num check your current site ranking with our ranking tool . 
^ &num modify your title and meta tags . 
^ we tell you how 
^ &num have your website recrawled with &num button click . 
^ visit our site ranking &name for details ! 
^ search engines provide a continuous stream of targeted visitors to your website , and for the most part , it 's free of charge . 
^ some engines do charge a listing fee , but most do not . 
^ the only thing the search engine asks is that each web site operator makes an effort to provide relevant and good information to web surfers for a particular search phrase . 
^ if a web site does so , the search engines will reward the site with increased good quality traffic . 
^ search engine traffic is a win-win situation for any online business . 
^ it does n't take much to improve on most web site 's search engine traffic - it just takes optimization . 
^ did you know that as of january &num &num , there were &num , &num , &num domain hosts in use worldwide ? 
^ did you know that &num of the web pages worldwide are not indexed by the largest search engines ? 
^ &num of web pages are not optimized . 
^ how can any business survive on the &name if it is not optimized for the search engines , and thus can never be found ? 
^ how can they exist if over &num of first time visitors never find their web site ? 
^ how much more money could a web site operator earn if they ensured their web site was even partially visible ? 
^ if you have an informative web site , the search engines want to send you lots of customers . 
^ that 's because the more web surfers find what they want , the more they 'll use a particular search engine and recommend it to their friends . 
^ the search engine also benefits , as it becomes known as a resource that gets its clients - the searchers - to their destinations quickly and efficiently . 
^ the more people recognize how well the engine works as a resource , the more it gets recommended , and used . 
^ as the popularity increases , so do the engine 's revenues from advertising . 
^ what does your web site need to receive traffic from the search engines ? 
^ small web sites with only &num or &num pages set themselves up for failure , simply because they usually do n't have enough content of interest . 
^ there are of course exceptions , where the &num or &num pages are each as long as a book . 
^ but these are awfully frustrating to read , and no one will be satisfied with them . 
^ most often &num or &num page sites are simply too short to provide any useful information , so the search engines do n't take them seriously . 
^ among other factors , the search engines examine how deep a site is . 
^ the more meaningful content present , the more weighty the site is viewed as , and the more importance it is given . 
^ if you are wondering about whether to bother , ask yourself this : why does your company have a web site ? 
^ what does the company do with it ? 
^ think about it . 
^ most companies today have web sites , and most market the web sites to facilitate customer acquisition , to increase their customer base , and to improve customer retention rates . 
^ there are a number of reasons for having web sites . 
^ many companies use theirs to enhance their customer service . 
^ using a web site as a marketing vehicle is a great way for a company ' to put the word out ' about products , services , or offerings . 
^ most importantly , remember that your web site is an online resource that your clients can use to find answers to frequently asked questions , ' how to ' tips , and to educate themselves . 
^ when including content on a web site , always remember that the knowledge shared may be common to you , but it 's likely that you are an expert in the eyes of your clients . 
^ people visit your web site for your product or service , but also for information . 
^ if they find useful , relevant , information , they will keep coming back , and will likely make purchases . 
^ people like to buy from experts . 
^ instead of thinking of your web site as nothing more than an online billboard or business card , think of it as an online menu , that lets people get an idea of what it is you do , and how you do it . 
^ develop a content rich website , optimize it , and let the search engines increase your website traffic , naturally . 
^ if you optimize each major web page within your site , you will increase the rankings in the search engine results and therefore receive targeted traffic for each of those pages . 
^ doing each of the above - ensuring relevant content is present , and optimizing the pages - will ensure that the search engines have what they need so they can do their work . 
^ it will also ensure that they can send you targeted traffic ( customers ) , so that you can get that &num of first time visitors your online business needs to survive .
