^ it started at as a lonley night for me , it was my 40th birthday . 
^ for me this brought little excitement , there was no one here to celebrate with , my daughter was away at college , and the love of my life had died years ago in a tragic car accident . 
^ i had recieved the customary calls from my family wishing me happy birthday , but there was little other fanfare . 
^ that was all about to change . 
^ &num of my daughters friends who was going to college locally was about to give me the ever . 
^ i had just settled into watch the late night news when i heard the doorbell ring . 
^ i glanced out the window and noticed it was odd , i thought , she was not carrying any gifts i let her in. she walked over to the piano , and she told me was going to start unwrapping the present . 
^ i was puzzled at this , then it all made sense . 
^ . 
^ she told me ever since she moved here a year ago she has had a crush on me , and wanted to give me something very special for my birthday . 
^ tight little &num year old body made me feel young again , it truly was the greatest present ever . 
^ remove me
