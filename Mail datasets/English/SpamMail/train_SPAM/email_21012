^ i 'm really , really tired of pop-up advertisements . 
^ that 's why we built the &name &name . 
^ &name &name stops cold unwanted javascript ( aka pop up ) executions before they even start . 
^ now you do n't have to play ' click the ' &char ' as fast as you can to close the stupid ad windows before a new one pops up ! ' game . 
^ we love this tool and think you will too . 
^ now you can get the &name &name as part of this limited marketing test . 
^ &website
