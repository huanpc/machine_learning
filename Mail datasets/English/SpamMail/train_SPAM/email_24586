^ &name &name welcome passage of postal pension &name by &name &name mailer groups breathed a collective sigh of relief tuesday when the house of representatives passed &num &char &num , the bill that would remove from the &name postal service the heavy burden of paying the pensions of many of its retired employees and stop a rate increase until &num .. 
^ the &name passed virtually the same bill last week . 
^ tuesday 's action clearing the way for president &name to sign it . 
^ last fall , the &name discovered that it had overpaid the civil service retirement system ( &name ) fund that provides for its retired employees by more than $ &num billion . 
^ but it order for the &name to reclaim that money it needed congressional approval . 
^ but they reiterated that this measure does not take the place of much-needed postal reform and that the industry must keep working toward that goal . 
^ ' we ca n't squander this opportunity , ' said &name &name , executive director of the alliance of &name &name . 
^ just the same , it does give mailers a bit of breathing room . 
^ ' this will help mailers who are just getting back on their feet from the recession , ' said &name &name , executive director of the mailers council . 
^ ' it also gives printers and paper companies a break since mailers will probably continue to mail with no rate increase hanging over their heads . ' 
^ ' this legislation will save the postal service $ &num billion this year and , according to the postmaster general , postpone any postage rate increases until &num - &num years from now , ' said direct marketing association &name &name &name &name in a statement . 
^ ' this delay will do much to encourage growth in the nine-million-job mailing industry . ' 
^ the magazine publishers of &name ( &name ) and its members congratulate and thank &name for giving final approval today to the postal civil service retirement system funding reform act of &num , ' said &name &name link in a statement . 
^ ' this remarkable achievement is the result of months of diligent work by &name , its members and the entire postal community . 
^ the passing of this legislation , which will save mailers $ &num billion in postage costs over the next &num years , means that magazines ' postal rates will now remain stable until at least &num . '

^ net.marketing under a &name by &name &name exhibitors for the net.marketing conference in &name are gritting their teeth . 
^ less than a month before the interactive event is to open , the direct marketing association has managed to sign on only &num exhibitors . 
^ as bad , sources said , is that only a small percentage of the expected &num , &num attendeess appear to have registered so far . 
^ the &name , which has a policy of refusing to confirm conference sign ups , said no matter what , the show must go on . 
^ it is scheduled for may &num to &num . 
^ ' we 're not going to cancel the event , the event is going forward , ' said &name spokesperson &name . 
^ there is clearly some scrambling behind the scenes , however . 
^ the exhibit hall , which was slated to be set up in &name 's exhibition center , has been moved to the &name hotel where the conference sessions are running . 
^ ' attendees will have to walk through the exhibit hall to go from the concurrent to the general sessions , so this will increase traffic , ' &name said . 
^ and , this week , the &name will announce that it is accepting the less-expensive tabletop exhibits for the first time . 
^ tabletops cost $ &num , &num versus the exhibit booth price of $ &num , &num for &name members . 
^ ( the nonmember prices are $ &num , &num for a tabletop and $ &num , &num for a booth . ) 
^ the confirmed exhibitors are trying to put a good face on things . 
^ ' i have to go because if i want my company to have a leadership role in the market , i have to stay the course , ' said deb &name , president of &name list services , &name , ma . 
^ but others said off the record that attendance is expected to be so low , it might be worse for business to attend than to stay home . 
^ most of the marketing for conferences typically occurs in the weeks just before it occurs , &name said . 
^ the &name has sent out a direct mail piece to about &num of last year 's exhibitors in january . 
^ a mailing to prospective attendees followed , &name &name , director of interactive marketing for the &name , said in an interview in january . 
^ ' we 'd like to get over &num , &num ( attendees ) like we did last year , ' handler said in that interview . 
^ ( &name resigned to pursue other interests in &name , according to the &name . 
^ he had already completed the program for the show . 
^ &name &name , director of conference planning now handles the net.marketing program 
^ but the bulk of the &name 's promotions have yet to occur , she said . 
^ these promotions include newspaper and broadcast ads in the &name &name area and e-mail broadcasts through other membership organizations . 
^ the &name is also working with the local &name direct marketing group to drum up interest in net.marketing . 
^ ' the weeks leading up to the conference , we get the highest number of sign ups , ' &name said . 
^ in addition to war nerves , a faltering economy and companies having cut back on education and travel budgets , the &name venue was a poor choice , exhibitors said . 
^ last year , the show was at the &name &name &name . 
^ ' when you 're in &name &name , you can just hop out for lunch and a lot of the interactive companies are headquartered there , ' said an unnamed source . 
^ ' there 's not a lot of interactive companies in &name . ' 
^ &name said if the show had remained in &name &name , the &name would have had to raise prices . 
^ to keep prices the same as &num , ' we looked at a couple of different places and decided &name was the best price set , ' she said . 
^ another problem might be timing . 
^ net.marketing occurs just before the &name catalog conference and the &name &name in &name &name show , which both occur in the first week of june . 
^ any chance net.marketing would be folded into &name &name , which the &name recently purchased ? 
^ ' at this point we 're going forward with both events , ' &name said . 
^ ' it 's too early to speculate right now and we 'll evaluate the options after the events . '

^ &name settles with bogus credit card marketers the federal trade commission has settled charges with &num operators of an allegedly fraudulent credit card scheme and their companies . 
^ &name &name and &name &name , principals of westcal equipment , doing business as pioneer first and &name &name services , have agreed to settle federal charges that they engaged in fraudulent business practices . 
^ the settlement prohibits the defendants from : 
^ * misrepresenting that , after paying a fee , consumers will or are highly likely to receive an unsecured major credit card . 
^ * failing to disclose clearly and prominently in all promotional materials and on the pioneer web site that the pioneer first platinum card can only be used to purchase merchandise through pioneer first and that a down payment is required in order to receive a credit card . 
^ * &name or receiving a fee when they have guaranteed or represented a high likelihood of success in obtaining a loan or other extension of credit 
^ * failing to obtain verifiable authorization to debit a consumer 's bank account . 
^ the order does not fine the defendants but will require them to pay $ &num million if they are found to have lied on their financial disclosure forms . 
^ the complaint--which grew out of a joint &name / &name state investigation--alleged that the defendants advertised nationally on cable tv for their pioneer first platinum credit card , implying that it was a major credit card . 
^ according to the &name , the defendants guaranteed a pioneer first platinum credit card with a $ &num , &num credit limit and &num interest for &num months to anyone who was a legal &name resident , at least &num years old , and had a checking account . 
^ according to the &name , when consumers responded to the ads , the defendants allegedly told them they had to pay an advance fee of $ &num to receive the card . 
^ according to the &name , the pioneer first platinum credit card was not a major credit card , but a catalog card good only for buying merchandise through pioneer first 's web site and catalog .

^ &name ideas , all . 
^ who , pray tell , could you convince to try to penetrate the wall of indifference regarding the value of direct mail at the corporate structure of &name 's? 
^ the advertising department and marketing people turn a deaf ear to direct mail : it 's much beneath them . 
^ change or learning new or different ways of doing things is not their long suit . 
^ the marketing group needs a good shaking up , but who and where to start to even get some attention ? 
^ why do n't you send your good article to the board of directors and stockholders ( if you can find them ) ? 
^ as you point out , there will soon not be an economical reason for the grand ole food chain to even exist . 
^ without profit , it will drift away . 
^ it can be saved , as you so rightly outline . 
^ they can test segments by region at minimal cost . 
^ good work .

^ i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with your observation that loyalty programs can change &name 's fate . 
^ while too many marketers fail to take advantage of inexpensive and readily available buyer information to build solid relationships and customer loyalty , &name 's is n't one of them . 
^ for a loyalty program to succeed , &name 's would have to create and promote a reward structure sufficiently appealing to get a large portion of its regular customers to both join and identify themselves each time they buy . 
^ it must implement technology to capture an &name number at thousands of outlets , adding many seconds to each transaction . 
^ an accurate database needs to be built and maintained . 
^ lastly , it must develop and implement tailored communications to these customers several times each year . 
^ for each name captured total annual costs will almost certainly exceed $ &num . 
^ for a profitable return on this investment , rewards and communications have to move a large percentage of these folks to buy enough hamburgers they would n't have purchased anyway such that the margins on these meals exceed program costs . 
^ though i do n't know their margin structure , i 'm guessing no program , however brilliant , can ever generate enough incremental sales from enough people and in enough time to turn &name 's around . 
^ their fundamental problem is sticking too long to a winning formula that 's becoming obsolete , a business truism that 's impacted many commercial giants . 
^ just as loyalty to the corner grocer could n't save them from &name and &name , shopper programs have n't reversed the inroads &name 's club and &name are making on the big supermarkets . 
^ and , in time the &name 's and &name 's of the world will , without doubt , be replaced by firms or channels that may not yet exist -- whether or not they implement a loyalty program .
