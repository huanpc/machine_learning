^ dear &name , 
^ my name is &name &name , the manager credit and foreign bills of ecobank of &name .i am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number &num / utb / &char &name died in a plane crash [ ethiopian airline &num ] with other passengers aboard . 
^ &name , since the death of this customer i personally have watched with keen interest to &name the next of &name but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of &name &char , [ &num million &num hundred &num united dollars ] has been with my bank for a very long time . 
^ on this note i decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of &name as no one has come up to be the next of &name . 
^ and the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than &num years , becuase after &num years the account will be declared dormant and the money forfeited to the bank . 
^ in view of this , i decided to contact you to &name as the next of &name . 
^ the request of a foreigner as next of &name in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner . 
^ i agreed that &num of this money will be for you as a foreign partner in respect of providing an account , while the rest will be for me . 
^ thereafter i will visit your country for disbursement . 
^ therefore to facilitate the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as arranged , you must apply first to the bank as a relation to the deceased indicating your bank name , your bank account number , your private telephone number , and &name number for easy communication and location where the money will be remitted . 
^ upon the receipt of your reply , i will send you by &name or e-mail the application and the next step to take . 
^ i will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as the whole required arrangement has been made for the transfer . 
^ you should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter . 
^ trusting to hear from you . 
^ yours respectfully , 
^ &name frank okolo .
