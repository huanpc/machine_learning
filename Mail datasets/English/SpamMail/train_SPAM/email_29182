^ sir , 
^ urgent business relationship 
^ i was the chairman of contract review panel in my country before the problem of the land reform program in my country &name . 
^ before the escalation of the situation in &name i recovered $ 16.8million us dollars from over inflated contracts by some government officials . 
^ but i was a member of the opposition party the &name ( movement for democratic change ) , and the ruling party , ( &name &name ) has been against us . 
^ so i had to flee the country for a neighbouring african country which i am currently residing . 
^ before the escalation of the situation in &name i had not reported the recovery of my findings to the panel .

^ i have been trying to fly to &name but it has been difficult for me to get a visa from &name . 
^ so i want you to help me make claims of this fund ( $ 16m ) in &name as my beneficiary and transfer the money to your account or any account of your choice before i can get a visa to fly down . 
^ so that we can share this money . 
^ i have agreed to give you &num , which would be ( $ 1.6million dollars ) of this money for your assistance , and &num would be mine and the other &num would be set aside for any expenses that we may incure during the course of this transaction . 
^ and part of my &num would be invested in your country in any profitable business propossed by you . 
^ we have never met , but i want to trust you and please do not let me down when this fund finally gets into your account .
