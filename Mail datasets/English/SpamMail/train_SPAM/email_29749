^ from : &name &name dear friend , this letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met . 
^ the message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it . 
^ i could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity . 
^ please accept my sincere apologies . 
^ in bringing this message of goodwill to you , i have to say that i have no intentions of causing you any pains . 
^ i am mr. &name &name , son of the late rebel leader &name &name of &name who was killed on the 22nd of &name &num . 
^ i managed to get your contact details through the internet myself as i was desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business . 
^ my late father , &name &name was able to deposit a large sum of money in different banks in &name . 
^ my father is presently dead and the movement of his family members ( including me ) is restricted . 
^ we are forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our localities . 
^ presently our movements are monitored . 
^ &name now there is a squabble over my father 's wealth both home and abroad by the government who are claiming that most of the wealth was got by arms smuggling and therefore illegal . 
^ you can know more about my father by checking his profile at &name below : &website million to over $ &num billion and being close to my father i happen to be in possesion of documents and information of some of the wealth ; approximately $ &num million and only my trusted mother knows that i have this information . 
^ presently , the us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num million united states dollars ) cash my father transfered to &name before his death is deposited with some security firms in &name and &name . 
^ before you can get access to it i have to give you the password . 
^ i am therefore soliciting your help to transfer into your account before my government gets wind of this fund . 
^ you know my father was a rebel leader in &name before his death . 
^ my reason for doing this is because it will be difficult for the angolan government to trace my father 's money to an individual 's account , especially when such an individual has no relationship , i decided to keep that money for my family use . 
^ at present the money is kept in a security company in &name i am currently and temporarily living in &name with my family . 
^ moreover , the political climate in &name at the moment being so sensitive and unstable . 
^ please your confidentiality in this transaction is highly required . 
^ you may aslo contact me via : yours sincerely , &name &name
