^ &name &name , 
^ with warm hearts i offer my friendship , and my greetings , and i hope this letter meets you in good time . 
^ it will be surprising to you toreceive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally . 
^ however , i am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction , which i propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity . 
^ my name is &name &name , the son of &name &name &name , a farmer from &name , murdered in the land dispute in my country . 
^ as led by my instinct , i decided to contact you through email , after searching for contacts via the internet , as it is the only means i can contact anybody since i am cutting off ties with &name for now . 
^ iapologize if this is not acceptable to you . 
^ the purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture . 
^ due to the land and political problems in &name , as a result of president &name &name 's introduction of new land act reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers , all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party members and my father though &name was the treasury of the farmers association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not support the president 's idea . 
^ he then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to invade my father 's farm and burn down everything in the farm . 
^ they killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm . 
^ after the death of my father , our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over will documents with instructions from my father that we should leave &name incase anything happen to him . 
^ the will documents has a certificate of deposit , confirming a cash deposit totaling &num million &num hundred thousand united state dollars . 
^ [ $ 14.5musd ] kept in custody for us in a security company , but unknown to the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as personal belongings . 
^ this money was deposited with this private security company for safety and security reasons , and was to be used for the purchase of land , new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in &name . 
^ this violent and barbaric act by &name has since led to the death ofmy beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent &name was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my fatherafter he was murdered . 
^ i resisted for a while , but when the danger became unbearable , and i survived &num murder attempts , i fled &name with the help of my father 's close friend mr. &name &name from &name also a farmer who was leaving in &name with us but left with his family following this ugly development i have tried to reach him but all to no avail . 
^ i am currently staying in the &name where i am seeking political asylum . 
^ in fact my decision to come here to seek asylum , is because the security company from &name &name , has a branch here , i have contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in &name here , which they have since done . 
^ i need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money . 
^ since the law of &name prohibits a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction , especially of this grate magnitude this is why i am seeking a genuine and reliable partner , whose account this money can be transferred , hence this proposal to you . 
^ you have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big and brave one , and it entrusts my future in your hands , as a result ofthe safe keeping of this money . 
^ if you accept to assist me , all i want you to do for me , is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office here in the &name , as it has now been transferred from &name , &name &name to their branch here . 
^ the company will be legally informed of you representing me . 
^ for your assistance , i have &num options for you . 
^ firstly you can choose to have &num of the money for your assistance , and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here , or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country . 
^ whichever the option you want , please to notify me in your reply . 
^ i have also set aside &num % of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction , and &name &name donation .
