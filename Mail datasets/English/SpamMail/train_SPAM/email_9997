^ well &name ! 
^ i have all the papers on my desk at home but have been wrapped up with &name being so sick that i spaced it . 
^ if you can , go pay for it and i 'll have &name void the check i have and make one out for you . 
^ thanks for thinking of it ... 
^ &name ... 
^ &name &name &name jr. ( &name ) w9hzc 
^ there was a question about what address to use on the mail box form . 
^ i left in car so will have to check with you on that later . 
^ you can use the street address we give to the state : 
^ &num &name dr. &name , ne &num 
^ - &name 
^ have you paid for the &name &name ? 
^ i have n't yet gotten a receipt for the payment in the box ( unless you got one in hand if you paid in person ) . 
^ if unpaid , today is the last day we will receive mail , then it will start bouncing ( though we have a couple of week 's grace before the box is reassigned ) . 
^ if you have n't yet paid for the box , i could go down today and make the payment and let the club reimburse me . 
^ let me know what would work best . 
^ - &name
