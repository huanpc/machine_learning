^ message of the day i spent most of my professional life believing that i was pretty good counseling or coaching individuals or teaching small groups of people , and that i did not have it in me to talk to large groups . 
^ you know the adage that some people would rather be in the coffin than give the eulogy , well that was me ( or almost ) . 
^ a few months ago i gave up that idea , suddenly remembering that i had held on to that thought since a speech i made when i was &num , and felt that i wanted the earth to open up under me . 
^ that was over &num years ago ! ! ! 
^ of course , i used all kinds of reasons ( excuses ) to justify my not wanting to talk to large groups . 
^ none of them , as it happens , are real . 
^ i discovered all this when i listened to myself closely , and yet again , found something new within me . 
^ i gave up the notion that i could not talk to big groups . 
^ &name and behold , the next thing i know i am talking to over &num people , all of whom seem to like it ! 
^ now i am looking forward so much to the next engagements i have that i can hardly wait . 
^ &num more lesson in how i can become more of who i really am . 
^ does it never stop ? 
^ no ! ! ! 
^ thank goodness .
