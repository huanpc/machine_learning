^ dear sir / madam , 
^ i am &name &name &name bank manager of &name bank , &name , &name . 
^ i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you . 
^ in &name &num , &num , a foreign oil consultant / contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation , mr. &name &name made a numbered time ( &name ) deposit for &num calendar months valued at us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num &num dollars ) in my branch . 
^ upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . 
^ after a month , i sent a reminder and finally i discovered from his contract employers , the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. &name &name died from an automobile &name further investigation , i found out that he died without making &char will , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . 
^ i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. &name &name did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . 
^ this sum of us $ &num , &num , &num has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for &name one will ever come forward to claim it . 
^ according to nigerian law , at the expiration of &num ( &num ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . 
^ consequently , my proposal is that i will want you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin . 
^ i am writing you because as a public servant ( manager with the bank ) , &num cannot operate a foreign account or have an account thatis more than $ 1m . 
^ i therefore want to present you as the next of kin ( the rightful owner of the fund ) so that you can be able to claim it with the help of an accredited attorney . 
^ finally , i urge you to provide immediately your full names , phone / fax numbers and your current mailing address so as to enable us commence the paperwork that will present you as the rightful beneficiary ( next of kin ) of the fund . 
^ as soon as the money is transferred to you &num is for me while &num is for you and &num will be for any expences made . 
^ please reply immediately via my email address . 
^ upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details that will help you understand this hitch free ( risk free ) transaction . 
^ thanks and &name bless . 
^ &name &name &name
