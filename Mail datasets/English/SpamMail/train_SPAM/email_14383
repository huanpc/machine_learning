^ how to make your business the center of attention by &name &name 
^ there is nothing like a good positive news story to put a business on the map . 
^ done right ; it will create more attention and have more credibility than thousands of dollars worth of paid-for advertising . 
^ but how do you achieve that ? 
^ start by writing a press release . 
^ keep it short and to the point . 
^ do n't ramble . 
^ use short sentences and paragraphs . 
^ concentrate on the news angle you 've come up with . 
^ write a good attention-grabbing headline . 
^ the purpose of the press release is not to tell your story . 
^ its sole purpose is to attract the attention of whichever journalist is assigned the task of going through that day 's pile of press releases . 
^ you 've got to make that journalist stop and read your release . 
^ you have to realize that the journalist is not just sitting there waiting for your press release to arrive . 
^ the fact is that most press releases do n't get read .
