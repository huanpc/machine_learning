^ &num ) &name strategic marketing mistakes to avoid 
^ this is a pretty tough global economy and it is critical for a company to leverage every bit of their marketing resources . 
^ so , if this is the case , why are so many companies shooting themselves in the proverbial foot by breaking some of the most fundamental rules of marketing ? 
^ it 's a very simple question with complex answers - here are some of the pitfalls to avoid : 
^ &num ) believing a second rate web site communicates integrity : so many we sites are just plain funky looking ( graphics , text , menus , etc. ) - nice professional term , but it 's descriptive of some of the dreck that passes for web site design . 
^ a company should not forget that perception is reality on the web and people are n't going to do business with a company that ca n't field a decent web site - end of story ! 
^ &num ) deploying a marketing strategy that 's all over the map : is &name a search engine , a portal or a &name &name company ? 
^ they are the classic &num hologram advertisement for a company that ca n't figure out what it wants to be when it grows up . 
^ a company must pick a marketing strategy and then stay the course - changing direction every time the wind shifts is not a good business strategy and creates more motion than action . 
^ &num ) forgetting real brand development : &name became the ' .com ' rallying cry for every newbie wet behind the ears with an &name dream to become a billionaire by selling dog food on the web ( i 'll leave the sock puppet out of this ) - we all know this did n't work . 
^ but that does not mean a company should ignore brand development - it 's important to remember that a good brand is built &num marketing process at a time ; everything that a company publishes , develops or communicate is part of the brand building process , which in turn defines the company 's market position . 
^ &num ) ignoring distribution channels by selling direct via an ecommerce web site : a company should not build and launch an ecommerce site and start selling direct to customers and forget about a distribution channel . 
^ it 's imperative to give the customer the choice to buy direct from your company or locate a distribution channel partner via a look up capability on the site . 
^ and , if you really want to win the hearts and mind of a channel never sell below retail ( &name ) - and afford the channel the opportunity to discount your product so they can compete effectively with you . 
^ &num ) making competitive analysis a low priority : too many companies forget about their competitors after the business plan has been written . 
^ they do n't take the time to review them on a periodic basis and try and figure out how to deliver goods and services differently , which in turn drives competitive advantage and a long-term sustainable business model . 
^ &num ) poorly thought out investor relations press release : do companies actually think investors are just plain stupid and do n't really read an &name ( investor relations ) directed press &name carefully ? 
^ investors are typically very bottom line oriented - they want to know about revenue growth and real strategic partnership developments that help the company grow and not much else . 
^ just throwing fluff out in the market and hoping this will drive investors to invest is just plain shortsighted stupidity . 
^ &num ) thinking any / all consultants know your business better than you : reporters and consultants ( including this &num ) have driven just as many companies into the ground with bad advice as much as they have helped them - companies must realize a consultant is typically not down in the trenches and they can make some bad calls - it 's important to filter their advice . 
^ &smiley letting the inmates run the asylum - customers should help a company refine its product marketing strategy by working as partners . 
^ if engineering tells marketing ' the customer does n't really know what they want but we do ' the red lights should start flashing danger - the company may be in serious peril and at the very least need new focus and direction for product marketing .
