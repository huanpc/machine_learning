^ confidential business partnership request for assistance 
^ dear sir / madam , 
^ you may be surprise to receive this letter from me , since you do n't know me personally ; i am larry edema the son of &name &name was recently murdered in a land dispute in &name . 
^ i am writing this letter to request your assistance and confidentiality to handle a transfer of fund into a foreign account and i decided to write you , my late father was among the few black &name rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president &name &name , for his alleged support and sympathy for the &name opposition party controlled by the white minority , before my fathers death , he has taken to &name and deposited the sum of &name &num , &num hundred thousand &name state dollars ( $ &num million ) with a security and finance company as if he foreseen the looming danger in &name . 
^ the money was deposited in a box as valuable items to avoid over taxed custom clearance . 
^ this money was allocated for the purchase of new machinery and chemical products for &name allied farm and for the establishment of new farms in &name and &name . 
^ these land problems arose when president &name &name introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers , and the blacks vehemently condemned the modus operandi adopted by the government . 
^ this resulted to rampant killings and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely more than &num thousands ( &num , &num ) people have so far been killed . 
^ heads of government from the west , especially &name and united states have voiced their condemnation of &name 's plans . 
^ subsequently , &name &name development community ( &name &char ) has continuously supported &name 's new land act , it is against this background that my entire family who are currently residing in &name &name have decided to transfer my father 's money into a foreign account . 
^ as the eldest son of my father , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our family 's wealth and &name &name government seem to be playing along with them . 
^ i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in &name &name for the fear of encountering the same experience in the future , since both countries have the same political history . 
^ more so , the &name &name foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment , hence i am seeking for political asylum in the &name . 
^ as a business person whom i entrusted my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is &num risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter . 
^ for your assistance , we are offering you &num of the sum &num for me and my family , while &num will be mapped out for any expenses that we may incurred during this transaction . 
^ we wish to invest our money on commercial properties based on your advice . 
^ finally , i will demand for assurance that you will not sit on the money when it gets to your personal or company account in your country . 
^ if this proposal is accepted by you , please confirm your interest by sending me an email &email ( mailto : &email ) &name : &num &name : &num my family number &name : &num &num in &name &name . 
^ best regards , 
^ &name &name
