^ &num &name &num | please be careful for next weeks . 
^ indexes will be rising quickly but it is only a correct wave . 
^ in my opinion , s&amp;p500 will rise to &num , &name to &num . 
^ on these levels one should take short positions . 
^ my prognoses are aimed in 90-95% . 
^ please check on newsgroups ( especially pl.biznes.wgpw ) or visit my site . 
^ &name prognoses were published in financial newspapers . 
^ i am looking for people , funds interested to establish the new fund / subfund operating on securities &name markets . 
^ securities &name fund 
^ my basic rule is a simultaneously analysis of several markets , indexes . 
^ an analysis of &num chart would cause frequent mistakes - from &num reasons : either the situation is too apparent ( and the market notice it ) or the situation is doubtful ( what makes to be out of the market ) . 
^ an analysis of several markets , indexes causes that &num can curry over a middle-term cycle to another market and explain which of possibilities will be realize on a proper market . 
^ only a simultaneously analysis of markets , indexes shows traps of the analyzed market . 
^ analyzes of alone market are correct in 70-80% plus often staying out of the market . 
^ simultaneously analyzes of several charts are correct in &num and give more possibilities . 
^ &char macroeconomic analysis should be aside to the end of technical analysis . 
^ in fact , fundamental analyses there are emotions and psychology of whom analyses the market . 
^ for example : an appreciation of a currency is justified that there is a better trade balance . 
^ nevertheless , most often the better trade balance is the result of a worse situation on the inland market . 
^ the appreciation of the local currency makes worse situation on the internal market . 
^ more difficult situation on the inland market makes , in spite of the appreciation of the local currency , that the export dynamically rises . 
^ and analyzers will be assert : ' in spite of some problems ( but each country in the same time may be in a worse situation ) , this country has again and again more competitive economy - the appreciation of the currency is justified , at all ! ' of course to time ( the real adaptation and growth of economy is a longer ) . 
^ theoretically , one can take into consideration the profits of companies , but these data are moved in the time towards a trade balance . 
^ moreover , the data about the real companies ' profits ( i.e. the information about a real condition of firms ) are much and much more moved in the time ! 
^ - one can say at least by &num cycle . 
^ my analysis is based on &name and &name . 
^ for forex is used different rules than to securities market . 
^ in additional , i have recognized some rules that are from &name 's interdependencies - actually , i want to have it for my knowledge . 
^ it improves the accuracy of prognosis to 90-95% . 
^ in fact , it is not &name , but in &name algorithms has its genesis . 
^ that is , in order , my techniques of analyses . 
^ the expectable profits : 3-4% per month if the fund will be operating only on &name 5-6% per month if there will be also securities ( indexes and stocks from &name &name ) . 
^ i prefer to take positions on securities market than on forex . 
^ more information about my prognoses is on the site . 
^ if you feel you have received this e-mail in error , or would not like to receive any further information , please visit this link and you will be taken off the list .
