^ hi &name to say , swapping internal drives will not work . 
^ laptops and their operating systems / drivers all carry proprietary bridge files pertinent only to the machine it is installed in. &name : your &name &name .. &name / &num will carry &num set of internal bridge files and a &name &name &name / &num will likely have another set . 
^ the only option in regards to swapping would be a non-bootable &name drive .

^ i 'm not necessarily interested in maintaining the &name install with the switch . 
^ i can reinstall from scratch , as if it is a blank drive . 
^ if necessary , i can boot into e.g. &name rescue mode and &num out the disk . 
^ i just want the flexibility of having modular components . 
^ the drive on the dell is dead ; no matter what our answer is , i need a drive for that system . 
^ can you recommend a specific drive ? 
^ i 'll just order it through your website . 
^ if that drive happens to ' fit ' into the &name , with the understanding that the &name might not be so kind , that 'd be peachy . 
^ thanks again - &name

^ you would just need to load the drivers on each machine and the unit is hot-pluggable . 
^ any questions please let me know . 
<text_embedded> 

^ thanks for making your informative site available . 
^ considering that you have just about the best prices for laptop harddrives , and the expertise , i am going to defer to you for this answer . 
^ i have a &name &name &name ( &name &num ) and a later model &name &name &name ( &name &num ) . 
^ the drive on the dell is kaput , and i would like a replacement drive that can swap between the &num systems . 
^ i think something in the &num &name range would be best ; it seems like the best price point and fits within my budget ( say , about $ &num shipped plus tax , or thereabouts ) . 
^ i 'm in &name &name . 
^ is there a drive that can fulfill this need ? 
^ are there any issues ? 
^ i can supply more exacting model numbers if necessary ( the thinkpads have a broad range of system numbers ) .
