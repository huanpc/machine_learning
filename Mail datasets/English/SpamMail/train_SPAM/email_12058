established its national prize pool at $  um ,  um . ^ in fact the actual prize pool based on  um of member dues should have been only $  um ,  um . ^  ame ,  ame  ame based on the sale of marketing licenses and future  ame due , decided to increase the pool to generate substantial media attention and publicity . ^ with the events of  um and the loss of its primary sponsor , several licensees were unable to meet their financial commitments to the  ame which left a short fall of $  um ,  um due winners from the  um event . ^ this had a negative impact on the  um season , which the  ame is still recovering from . ^ forced to postpone it  um national until the  um players are paid , the  ame sought additional capital from its original backers and managed to pay the debt down . ^ the final payments to players are scheduled for the end of april  um and the rescheduled  um event is scheduled for may  um  um  um with a $  um ,  um prize pool . ^ ' as testimony to the tremendous popularity of the  ame concept , of the  um players effected the vast majority understood the situation and has remained loyal to the  ame until the situation can be resolved ' said  ame  ame ,  ame of the  ame . ^ ' we intend to emerge from this stronger than ever and expect significant growth for  um ' he further stated . ^  ame ^ the  ame is currently being sued by the  ame state ,  ame office . ^ this suit is relative to the  ame statute , which governs miss-leading advertising and deceptive trade practices . ^ this suit stems from  um complaints from players who argue that the  ame advertisers a $  um ,  um ,  um prize pool yet has not yet paid a $  um ,  um ,  um prize pool . ^ through its attorney , the  ame has filed a motion for dismissal based on the fact the $  um ,  um ,  um prize pool is clearly disclaimed in its advertising and that the actual prize pool is based on  um of actual dues collected . ^ the  ame 's office is seeking damages of $  um ,  um on each count (  um ) . ^ however , the  ame attorney expects to settle the issue with the  ame in a favorable manner within the next  um weeks . ^ there are over  um ,  um such suits against businesses in  ame pending from the  ame 's office . ^  ame is the only company in the world offering this concept of amateurs playing for pay in a gigantic growing golf market . ^  ame is the first and only to sell licenses in the  ame and internationally , which should enable  ame to expose it self and bring on new members in a very quick manner and bring immediate revenue to the bottom line . ^  ame ^ to all the hackers out there , and we certainly do n't mean computer , it appears to us that we finally have a venue to look like and act as a golf  ame . ^ maybe not  ame  ame , but certainly get the feeling and the jitters of what the pro 's go through every week . ^ golf is now coming into the heart of its season , where the most profiled tournaments like the masters and other 'majors ' from all  um tours ,  ame ,  ame , and  ame  ame are coming amateurs are all getting ready for their golf  ame and many will be attending professional golf tournaments or will be viewing them on tv . ^ as stated from  ame 's most recent  ame ' based on our current marketing budget , management anticipates revenues to increase five-fold in  um to $  um million over the $  um million generated in  um . ^ our membership base grew to over  um members in just  um years time . ^ based on our current projections , we anticipate revenues tripling in  um to $  um million . ^ there is a significant correlation between our direct marketing activities and licensees , and our revenues . ' ^ just like  ame ,  ame  ame ,  ame ,  ame  ame and many other successful licensed franchises have taken advantage of selling franchises and branding , we feel the  ame is well on its way . ^ with  ame being in a unique position of being first to market as a public company with their concept , generally speaking first to market companies usually command a higher premium than their peers . ^ according to  ame ,  ame would be classified as recreational activities , company 's within this industry trade in the market place at about  um times sales . ^ if over the near term  ame demonstrate sales growth through various licensing agreements ( their revenue model ) , and trades in the market place at a  um multiple of its peers (  um times ) , then based on projected revenues of $  um million dollars next year . ^ when applying the comparative grouping 's average price to revenue multiples to  ame we can arrive at a relative valuation of $  um per share over the near term . ^ conclusion ^ the golf industry has been very fortunate to have star players on its tours . ^ from  ame  ame (  ame ) ,  ame  ame (  ame  ame ) , to  ame  ame (  ame ) on the  ame  ame  ame to  ame  ame (  ame ) ,  ame  ame (  ame ) , and se  ame  ame (  ame  ame ) on the  ame  ame  ame , there are many stars from all over the world . ^  ame , this summer ,  ame  ame will be participating in a  ame  ame event , which should bring a great deal of press coverage around the world , and should be only good for the game of golf . ^ think about it , with national publicity from the golf channel , sports illustrated , many national golf publications and now exposure of being a public entity combined with the unmatched growth of golf , we feel there is upside potential for investors of  ame . ^ * * * * * * * important notice and  ame : please  ame * * * * * * * ^  ame insights , and affiliates (  um ) , publishes reports providing information on selected companies that  um believes has investment potential . ^  um is not a registered investment advisor or broker-dealer . ^ this report is provided as an information service only , and the statements and opinions in this report should not be construed as an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any security . ^  um accepts no liability for any loss arising from an investor 's reliance on or use of this report . ^ an investment in  ame is considered to be highly speculative and should not be considered unless a person can afford a complete loss of investment . ^ an affiliate of  um has been hired by the company , and additionally received  um million free trading shares of common stock of  ame by a third party for the publication and circulation of this report . ^  um intends to sell all or a portion of the of the  ame stock at or about the time of publication of this report . ^ subsequently  um may buy or sell shares of  ame stock in the open market . ^ this report contains forward-looking statements , which involve risks , and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements . ^ for further details concerning these risks and uncertainties , see the  ame filings of  ame including the company 's most recent annual and quarterly reports . ^ (  ebsite ) ^ you are currently subscribed to the investor insights mailing list as unsubscribe , send a blank email to : mailto :  mail </text_normal></message_body></message>
