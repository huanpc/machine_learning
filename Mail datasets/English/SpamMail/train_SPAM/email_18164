^ from : &name . 
^ sola cole dear friend , this letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met , but kindly consider the message , because , i am determined to live for posterity . 
^ i wish to plead with you to join me in not only serving humanity , but to also benefit in the process . 
^ this message could be strange but reality will definitely dawn on you , if you pay some attention to its contents . 
^ please accept my sincere apologies . 
^ in bringing this message to you , i have to say that i have no intention of causing you any personal pains or discomfort . 
^ i am dr. &name &name , former special assistant to the late liberian president , who was murdered by rebels.president &name &name , in his bid to fend-off rebel insurgency , and since he could no longer trust the army generals , confidentially put in my care , the sum of $ &num , &num , &num ( &num million united &name dollars ) , in &num instance , and another $ &num , &num , &num ( &num million united &name dollars ) for the purpose of purchasing arms and ammunitions should the need arise . 
^ but unfortunately , the need did not arise and i could not purchase these arms before he was ambushed and killed by rebels . 
^ of these monies , i deposited the first instalment of us $ &num , million in an offshore bank account , while the other sum of $ &num , million is being kept in trunk boxes in a security deposit company , and just the &num of us knew about it , and i could not get in touch with any arms dealer before the then president was killed . 
^ i was able to transport these trunk boxes out of &name , with the aid of ecomog soldiers under the guise conveying my personal effects without anybody knowing . 
^ i am presently in &name , where i am trying to set-up a consultancy on inter-regional co-operation . 
^ i have borne the burden for too &name do not want to keep the funds any longer , but i can never turn it over to the brutal and tyrannical rogue regime of &name &name ( then rebel leader and now &name president ) , who is still committing all sorts of atrocities on the liberian people . 
^ i am not solicitng for your help to wage a war against the regime , but to act as a foreign partner , to allow me transfer the funds to you , and you , in turn , would donate a portion of it as a humanitarian gesture to the liberian people by purchasing such essential needs like blankets , milk and so on , water-pumping machines and agricultural equipment , from the money after deducting your expenses and the comission of &num . 
^ please note that i could have approached the &name &name &name , but i changed my mind on that after calculating what they would deduct as comission , and also , after rationalising the scandal that followed their mismanagement of the donations meant for the victims of the september 11th attack on the united states . 
^ also note that this offer will give you a double-edged advantage : 
^ &num as the benefactor of the liberian people and ; 
^ &num the comission you stand to earn . 
^ on getting a positive response from you , i will send to you the secret access codes to the account in the offshore bank and the security and vault company . 
^ please note that confidentiality and honesty are fundamental rules in this transaction . 
^ be assured that i am a reputable personality in this country and i am mindful of the legal implications of this transaction , as i intend taking care of all the legal documentations for a successful and hitch-free transaction . 
^ you will be expected to take delivery of the consignment , personally from the deposit company in &name . 
^ with the password and information that i will give you , together with the &name of attorney , you would then proceed to the security firm , as these will facilitate your collection of the consignment ( trunk-boxes ) containing the us $ &num , &num , &num . 
^ i am therefore soliciting your assistance to have this money collected by you and / or facilitate the transfer into your nominated account ( &char ) . 
^ * * * please note that your confidentiality in this transaction is highly required . 
^ i will give you the details of this transactionon receipt of your response to this proposal.thank you very much for your time and understanding . 
^ yours sincerely , dr &name &name .
