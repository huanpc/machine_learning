^ ( &website ) ( &website ) ( &website ) 
^ &website ( mailto : &email ) hi &name &name , 
^ rather than writing reviews of sites this week i wrote about some things that are critical for designers . 
^ these articles are the result of sifting through the internet trying to find quality content for the &name readers . 
^ these are important subjects not only to flash developers , but to the design community as a whole . 
^ send me your thoughts -- you are part of this community and your feedback ( mailto : &email ) helps everyone . 
^ thanks , &name &name ( mailto : &email ) 
^ ( &website ) ( &website ) 
^ what is the purpose for your site ? 
^ i had a meeting with a client a few weeks ago and i shocked myself completely . 
^ the client requested that i design a flash intro for his site . 
^ before i could think twice the words had already come out of my mouth . 
^ ' why do you want a flash intro for your site ? ' i asked . 
^ his response was that he wanted to outline his company 's offerings . 
^ so i responded ' knowing that most of your viewers are on dial up connections , you 'll be cutting out over half of your possible clients by doing this . 
^ does n't the site itself tell the viewers what you do ? 
^ was n't that the purpose of building the site in the first place ? ' 
^ after much discussion i persuaded the client to stick with static &name for this particular project . 
^ &name ( &website 
^ ( &website ) 
^ in a way i felt that i had turned my back on flash . 
^ after pondering for several weeks now i know that i had made the right decision in not making the flash intro for the client . 
^ i know i would have designed a great intro , but that 's not what i was hired to do . 
^ i was hired to help the client send his message out to potential customers and in the bigger picture help him to make more business for his company . 
^ if i had decided to add the &name &name considering his audience , we would n't have fulfilled the purpose for the site . 
^ before you even start designing a site you need to take a look at what the project requires , the audience , and any other factors needed . 
^ when i was in grade school i wrote a paper for my class assignment . 
^ after hours and hours of hard work i finally finished the paper and turned it in to the teacher . 
^ i remember ms. &name saying to me ' i can tell that you put a lot of work and effort into this paper , but what is the purpose for you writing this paper ? ' 
^ being a child of &num i responded , ' because you assigned it to us ? ' she laughed and then told me , which has stuck through writing into design , every paper that you write needs to have a purpose . 
^ you need to have a reason for writing , or else you 're wasting your time . 
^ now , before i even move the mouse to start designing a site , i pick up my pen and paper and just as i would write a story . 
^ i go through all the steps that you would if you were going to write a paper for your 2nd period english professor . 
^ now i hope you can see that a lot more goes into a site than just the ' pretty ' graphics . 
^ i hope the next time you 'll do your duty as a designer and try your best to help make the &name easy to use . 
^ when you 're building your site , or your client 's site , ask yourself , ' is the site accomplishing its purpose ? ' if you say yes , then you 've done your job as a designer . 
^ ( &website ) 
^ &name comes first ! 
^ now that you have your purpose ready , it 's time to look at your content and your design . 
^ is n't the point of web design to portray information for viewers ? 
^ each site has a purpose for being on the web ( or should anyway ) . 
^ for entertainment , for business , for facts , for school , etc. the reason we design is to make information more accessible for the viewers of the &name . 
^ it 's our job to make the &name easy to use . 
^ if we are too worried about how the design looks without giving much thought to the content involved we are cutting out the whole reason we built the site . 
^ to share information ! 
^ i notice myself designing sites , then looking back and them and saying , ' um ... that does n't quite look like i want it to ' . 
^ after making a thousand versions of the same site i finally realized what i was doing wrong . 
^ i was paying more attention to the design of the site than the reason i had intentionally built the site - to share information . 
^ on every single design the content was difficult to read . 
^ the over all look of the site was nice , but i was neglecting the content . 
^ there are thousands of sites out there that have great content , but lose viewers within the first &num seconds because it 's difficult to read , the page is loading too slow , they ca n't find the navigation or they ca n't understand how it works because it 's not labeled , and tons of other 'design ' flaws . 
^ this has become much more common since the release of flash . 
^ flash designers get enthralled in the site because they want to design something ' cool ' . 
^ &name is right along with them . 
^ not in the ' cool ' factor exactly , but now that the bulk of their site is in flash it takes forever to load . 
^ i 'm on a &name here in the office and if a page does n't load pretty quick , then something is wrong and well , &name it horrible now . 
^ it takes me like &num longer to find something i 'm looking for , and you ca n't copy links , or right click and open in a new window . 
^ it 's very very very frustrating . 
^ what 's that old saying ? 
^ do n't fix it if it ai n't broke ? 
^ i 'm so tired of finding sites that are &num flash with no other purpose than to show a few neat little tricks . 
^ or sites that take so long to load that you 've already found the information in your second browser before the original site you were viewing has loaded . 
^ or sites that are so bogged down with ' crap ' that you could n't find the good stuff . 
^ what gives ? 
^ take a look at the most useful sites on the &name : 
^ &website ( &website 
^ what do they all have in common ? 
^ they way they portray their content . 
^ they also all have a purpose for existing . 
^ so the next time you are working on your site take a look at your content and really consider if you are paying attention to content over design . 
^ can you read the content easily ? 
^ does it load quickly enough ? 
^ flash is just a tool to help you be a better designer , so think about its use and how you can design more effectively . 
^ now i 'll get off my soapbox and hope that &name readers will design for accessibility of information rather than just for ' pretty ' graphics .
