^ look into it , as it can be very profitable . 
^ &name care who says you have to be a teenager to make a couple of extra bucks mowing lawns ? 
^ let 's face it , not many people want to care for their lawn and landscaping on the weekends when they could be spending their free time with family and friends . 
^ &char great way to supplement your income is by offering lawn maintenance . 
^ start with your local neighborhood and then branch out to different areas if it takes off .

^ pet sitting for people who are pet owners , its difficult to find enough time to give pets the needed attention .
