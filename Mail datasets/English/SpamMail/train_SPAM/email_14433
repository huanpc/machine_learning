^ frank and terri 's &name life .. read up ! 
^ &name and i had been having some problems in the ' intimate department ' so to speak , and i thought it would be a great idea to spice up our sex life a little bit , before having to give up all hope ! 
^ at our age lets face it , you kinda need a good sexual partner to keep the relationship interesting right ? 
^ otherwise your just wasting your time thats the way i look at it anyway . 
^ ok so , not knowing exactly how to go about it i asked a few of my friends to help me out . 
^ though most of their ideas were no doubt , great &num and &name and i experimented with a few of them . 
^ in the long run it still was n't working out . 
^ &smiley that 's when &name came up with the idea to videotape us having sex in the living room on my couch among other things i was n't crazy about it at first but we had tried everything else so it was worth a shot , and this time it worked ! ! ! 
^ it was so thrilling watching ourselfs on the video after the opinions of our friends we decided to post the video , along with some pictures on a website for free !
