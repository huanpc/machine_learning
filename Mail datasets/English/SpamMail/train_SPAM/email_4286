^ that bad &num letter word 
^ dear &name , 
^ have you ever put off something until the last minute and then realized there is no way you can get it done ? 
^ what do you do then ? 
^ you start finding reasons why you did n't really need to do it in the first place ! 
^ if that sounds familiar , welcome to the world of procrastination . 
^ that &num letter word gets more of us into trouble than we care to admit . 
^ but here 's something that you wo n't be able to put off , retirement . 
^ &name , you might have to keep working longer than you want to , but someday you wo n't even be able to work , even if you have to . 
^ that 's a tragic event that many people are facing and what 's even more tragic is that it does n't have to be that way . 
^ if you are still interested in starting your own home-based business , do n't procrastinate . 
^ there will be a time when you will have to face the realities of old age . 
^ &name those times on your own terms .
