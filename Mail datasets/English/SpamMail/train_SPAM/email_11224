^ the answers rest in the perceived 'downside ' factors : costs , loss of flexibility , time delays linked with time to market , loss of independence , the prospect of imposed delays in fault situations and the fear of aggressive and commercial ' third party ' bodies interfering and causing excessive and unnecessary layers of assessment . ^ the result of all of this is that the conformity assessment field , integrated as it is into society and economy and being essential to business , is a battleground fought over for the establishment of strategies and best systems . ^ at stake are the ownership of resources , the defense of business positions and investments , and the future of jobs and careers . ^ in the light of the above in the next and final article in this series , i will consider the question : is conformity assessment an expanding business ? ^ please submit all reactions to this article to : ^  ame  ame currently is the president of having been the secretary general  um , and his heavy involvement with conformity assessment has spanned  um years . ^ prior to  ame worked for  ame for  um years , successively as  ame of  ame services ,  ame  ame director , and commercial director , following which for  um years he was director general of the beama federation . ^ he has been president of  ame , chairman of the british approvals service for cables and chairman of  ame and chairman of  ame , the large european engineering federation . ^ click here to access the full version of can (  ebsite ) ) ) ^ transforming technology for  ame  ame & security in the 21st century : the tsm-concept , the leading edge towards an interculturally convertible conformity assessment scheme with worldwide reach ^ some  um years ago when  ame  ame  ame  ame showed up first in the  ame and in  ame the world was quiet different . ^ today ,  ame is a necessity , but it is no longer sufficient . ^ because today the quality of a product is just  um issue apart from safety aspects in order to protect the user , from environmental aspects ensuring health and from social accountability aspects considering ethical values . ^ the  ame  ame  ame  ame concept is considering these aspects systematically in the fields of product-testing , process-consulting and people-training . ^ even more , supporting innovative product solutions is a key issue within the  ame program ... ^ click here to access the full version of can (  ebsite ) ) ) ^ what is  ame  ame ?

' . ^ the aim was to review progress and experience in this field , both in the voluntary and the regulatory sectors , and to draw conclusions for the future . ^  um countries were represented at the workshop , which was the latest of the series of critical issues workshops which commenced in  um . ^ the first  um sessions , chaired by  ame  ame ,  ame of  ame  har /  um  ame  ame , respectively covered ' the  ame ' and  ame latest developments ' . ^ the afternoon sessions , chaired by  ame  ame , the president of covered '  ame  ame  ame and ideas ' and the '  um  ame  ame ' , an innovative feedback session . ^ topics covered included an overview of  ame (  ame  ame ) , basic operating instruments (  ame  ame ) , an industry view on whether recognition means acceptance (  ame  ame ) , a review of the recently published  ame /  ame  ame  um on  ame (  ame  ame ) , a report on latest developments on recognised agreement groups (  ame  ame ) , and on information services in support of these groups (  ame  ame ) . ^ those present were brought up to date on some latest developments in the  ame field relating to the newly recognised  ame for the european telecommunications services association (  ame  ame ) , the pre-recognition agreement group ' total security  ame ' initiative (  ame  ame ) , and the  ame between the european  ame and  ame (  ame  ame ) . ^ the  um  ame  ame enabled detailed presentations to be made by volunteers from the registered delegates . ^ don mader of ul talked about a global company contributing to mutual recognition through a transportable conformity assessment strategy ,  ame  ame about the  ame scheme and its transition to an  ame scheme for electronic components ,  ame  ame about the work of the european association for  ame  ame ,  ame  ame about the development and role of  ame and  ame  ame about the work of the  ame voltage  ame . ^ in commenting on the morning sessions  ame  ame confirmed the complexity of the mutual recognition field , with ' voluntary ' and 'regulatory ' initiatives trying to resolve the different facets of the issue . ^ he noted that the morning presentations indicated that there remained a significant future for such initiatives , perhaps even unilateral recognition . ^ it seemed obvious that regulatory , or government-to-government  ame were probably not the best first approach between  um different systems . ^ he felt that mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sector indeed pave the way for agreements in the regulatory sector . ^ he felt that the respective contributions of accreditation and peer assessment needed to be understood better , because they are important tools in increasing confidence and preparing for mutual recognition and trade facilitation . ^ in this respect , the participants supported the idea that the reflection on the concept of accreditation and on its use in the designation of conformity assessment bodies should continue , including in the  ame committee on technical barriers to  ame , where it had already been on the agenda of the previous  ame review of the agreement . ^ he acknowledged that we are still a long way from the one-stop approach , in relation to evidence of conformity as a basis for reaching the widest possible market , but that there was still no better tool than mutual recognition , which to a certain extent favours the convergence of the systems . ^ he acknowledged that mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sector deliver specific , practical and rapid results and that agreements in the mandatory sector prepared for future approximation of the systems , through the intense regulatory cooperation made necessary by the implementation of these agreements , which would not take place otherwise . ^ as a trade official , he congratulated for its activity and for flagging up these issues . ^ during the whole day , both during the sessions and in the corridors , there was a detailed exchange of views . ^ in his conclusions to the workshop ,  ame  ame commented on the iterative process which had been taking place during the day . ^ very experienced presenters had both taught and learnt ; lessons would be passed on to others outside the room and these would be applied , there would be further development on the basis of which the constructive process of learning and teaching would continue . ^ he raised the earlier question of  ame  ame concerning the reaction of participants to the benefits of mutual recognition agreements . ^ the majority of those present felt that mutual recognition agreements in the voluntary sector are very important . ^ whilst there was significantly less support for such agreements in the mandatory sector , where results have been slow to appear , it was generally agreed that the work of governments in this area was advisable . ^ clearly the  ame movement will have to go forward on the basis of the  um sectors working together with increasingly good understanding . ^ to view the workshop presentations , please visit : additional information and to learn more about  ame  ame groups please visit : here to go back to the menu ) ) ^

the technical construction file : the foundation of your ce-mark ^ not everything in  ame is standardized . ^ there is at the moment not even a standard for  um of the key elements of the  ame approach , the technical construction file . ^ but there are a number of arguments in favour of a standardised technical construction file . ^ let 's consider first of all the function of the technical construction file . ^ what if a manufacturer fails to draft one ? ^ who 's going to know ? ^ consumers want a copy of the manual , in their language . ^ business customers insist on obtaining a copy of the declaration of conformity . ^ but the technical construction file is nobody 's business except the manufacturer 's, because the file contains the company 's essential know-how on the safety aspects of the product . ^ it 's the reason why a manufacturer should n't hand out copies to clients ; it 's the reason why a manufacturer does n't want to hand over a copy to his importer . ^ which brings us to the fact that a manufacturer from outside the  ame , should get himself an authorised representative . ^ the  ame approach states that a copy of the technical should be held within the  ame . ^ do you want to place critical production information in the hands of your importer , who also happens to produce a similar product , or also sells products from your
