^ the &name count ( british thermal units , the measurement of the quality of gas with &num , &num being average ) was tested at &num , &num &name 's, therefore garnering a premium for the gas being sold . 
^ &name hole pressure was calculated at &num , &num psig and casing pressure was measured at &num , &num psig . 
^ the key to this new discovery to &name is that it was made in the fractured formation that has essentially not been tested in the past . 
^ this major new discovery could mean a more substantial drill program for &name than the proposed &num well program previously announced .

^ these reports also indicate the &website tcf of unassociated gas ( gas &name ) from &num through to june &num . 
^ it is estimated that this district accumulated approximately &num &name of casinghead gas . 
^ during the year &num , district &num made &num million barrels of oil , &num bcf of casinghead gas and &num bcf of unassociated gas .
