^ dear artists , 
^ i am happy to bring you word of an exciting new summer downtown &name &name show . 
^ buskerfest' &num presents this year &name 's first mask and &name market and &name &name ! 
^ please review the enclosed information and visit our web site @ the events link of &website the word . 
^ it 's our first year and we are getting a late start so any help in finding the right artists for this exciting cultural event would be greatly appreciated . 
^ if you ca n't read the attachments let me know what format would work better for you . 
^ &name &name , market coordinator 
^ &num will be the first year of &name 's mask and &name market and &name &name . 
^ it will be located in &name 's new east &name , just north of &name 's &name park , just across the river south from navy &name and the river east shopping district and just east of &name avenue . 
^ we expect lots of traffic from office buildings in the neighborhood on friday and excited tourists friday night and saturday . 
^ our goal is to feature art and artists of a daring and active nature . 
^ our focus on masks and puppets should not keep any artist from applying in the first year , but we are particularly interested in daring and active art with some relation to the street performer 's festival that &name features . 
^ for this reason we hope to encourage art dance and theatre organizations to present work or feature information about their work in our spaces . 
^ we have special rates for artists who make their own work , arts organizations , and will award smaller fees to some mask and puppet artists . 
^ &name &name ' &num mask and puppet showing possibilities are brewing . 
^ out of town artists can participate by sending &num to &num masks to be sold on consignment , so apply even if you ca n't come yourself this year ! 
^ get in on the ground floor of this exciting new cultural event . 
^ there is no cost to apply . 
^ fees will be billed upon acceptance .
