^ discovered from his contract employers , nigerian national petroleum 
^ corporation that mr. &name &name died from an automobile accident . 
^ on 
^ further investigation , i found out that he did not leave &char will and 
^ all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless .

^ this sum of us $ &num , &num , &num is still 
^ sitting in the &name and the interest is being rolled over with the

^ according to the nigerian law , at the 
^ expiration of &name years , the money will revert to the ownership of

^ government officials .

^ into your account for us to share in the ratio of &num for me and 25% 
^ for you , then &num will be set aside for expenses incured during the transfer .
