^ &website ( mailto : &email ) hi &name , 
^ i hope everyone got the answer to the &name &name site . 
^ i 've included a few interesting sites for this week 's issue of &name including a neat war type game for all of you . 
^ also , make sure to check out this week 's tutorial section for video tutorials and making &num lines using actionscript . 
^ send us your feed back ! 
^ thanks , &name &name ( mailto : &email ) 
^ ( &website ) ( &website ) 
^ ( &website / ) 
^ here is another nice clean site from a design firm out of &name . 
^ the menus were a &name awkward , but the over all look and feel was quite nice . 
^ check it out &website / 
^ ( &website / ) 
^ here 's an interesting game that will teach you how to start working and looking for bombs . 
^ it 's a semi war type game , but no , you do n't get to kill anyone !

^ over the years i 've found loads of great tutorials and information , but who has time to read it all ? 
^ i was looking for something that i could watch while i was working and not have to refer back to text , catch up to where i was , and continue with my project . 
^ after surfing for the perfect solution , i finally decided that video tutorials would best suit my needs . 
^ after looking over several sites i found apex web &name &name &name &name . 
^ i was very wary to buy video cds that i could n't preview , but these guys have an excellent selection of demo videos . 
^ &name ( &website 
^ ( &website ) 
^ i asked them to send me a few cds for me to review for the &name readers and-wow-was i surprised . 
^ the videos were awesome . 
^ very easy to understand and they went it was just like being in a classroom with no other students , except you could hit pause ! 
^ i really liked how the videos were presented and they were super easy to use . 
^ the browser for the videos even checked off the videos that i had already previewed . 
^ so if you 're looking for &name &name , this is the place to find it . 
^ they also offer loads of other video tutorials for other software .

^ for all the wonderful and neat things you can do with actionscript , it 's ironic that the simple task of drawing a line can be such a difficult thing . 
^ &name has no native function to draw a line . 
^ everything done in actionscript must be done within the context of movie in this article i will explain how you can draw lines using movie clips . 
^ first we must create a movie clip that will act as a line . 
^ open a new &name & make the size &num by &num pixels . 
^ create a new movie clip in the library . 
^ use the line tool ( &char ) to make a horizontal line that starts as ( &num , &num ) and is &num pixels wide . 
^ next , drag the line movie clip into the first frame . 
^ &name click on the movie clip and select panels , instance . 
^ name this movie clip ' line ' . 
^ now select the first frame from the timeline , and press &name twice to create &num new key frames . 
^ these are all the frames necessary to make our actionscript sequence . 
^ now let 's move on to the nitty gritty of the action script . 
^ &name click on the third keyframe and select actions . 
^ add this line to the action script : 
^ &name ( &num ) ; 
^ this will ensure that when the movie is played , it will run through the actions in the first frame once , then repeatedly play the actions of frame &num and &num . 
^ this is important because we will put all of our initialization code and functions in the first frame . 
^ the main body of the actionscript will be placed in the second frame . 
^ the third frame will simple rewind back to frame &num . 
^ we 'll now make a function called 'setline ' that will take &num numbers ( &char , &char , &char , &char ) as parameters . 
^ this function will change the scale and rotation of the ' line ' movie clip so that &num end rests at ( &char , &char ) the other end at ( &char , &char ) . 
^ now go to the actions menu of the first frame . 
^ put the following code into the first frame : 
^ next , drag the line movie clip into the first frame . 
^ &name click on the movie clip and select panels , instance . 
^ name this movie clip ' line ' . 
^ now select the first frame from the timeline , and press &name twice to create &num new key frames . 
^ these are all the frames necessary to make our actionscript sequence . 
^ now let 's move on to the nitty gritty of the action script . 
^ &name click on the third keyframe and select actions . 
^ add this line to the action script : 
^ &name ( &num ) ; 
^ ( &website . 
^ we 'll now make a function called 'setline ' that will take &num numbers ( &char , &char , &char , &char ) as parameters . 
^ this function will change the scale and rotation of the ' line ' movie clip so that &num end rests at ( &char , &char ) the other end at ( &char , &char ) . 
^ now go to the actions menu of the first frame . 
^ put the following code into the first frame : 
^ function setline ( &char , &char , &char , &char ) 
^ dist angle if ( &char ( &char ) 
^ angle 
^ &name ( ' line ' add count , &char , &char ) ; 
^ &name ( ' line ' add count , &char , &char ) ; 
^ &name ( ' line ' add count , _xscale , dist ) ; 
^ &name ( ' line ' add count , _rotation , angle ) ; 
^ here 's a brief explanation of the function . 
^ the third line creates a variable called 'dist ' . 
^ it also calculates the distance between the points ( &char , &char ) and ( &char , &char ) , and assigns it to 'dist ' . 
^ the fourth line computes the angle ( in degrees ) of the line that points ( &char , &char ) and ( &char , &char ) make and puts it into the variable ' angle ' . 
^ finally the &num setproperty lines actually manipulates the properties of the line movie clip so that then ends are at ( &char , &char ) and ( &char , &char ) using variables 'dist ' and ' angle ' . 
^ do n't worry if you do n't understand the math behind it all , just trust that if you call this function it will make the ' line ' movie clip move according to the variables &char , &char , &char and &char passed to it . 
^ now all that is left is to actually call this function . 
^ we will do this in frame &num because frame &num will be repeated continuously for the life of the movie . 
^ for now just put the following code into frame &num : 
^ setline ( &name ( &num ) , &name ( &num ) , &name ( &num ) , &name ( &num ) ) ; 
^ press &name to test the movie . 
^ you should see a line that randomly changes it 's position . 
^ it does this because each time frame &num is repeated we send to the setline function &num random numbers between &num and &num . 
^ like many of my tutorials the end result is pretty much useless . 
^ the real magic comes when you build onto the code to make the line or lines ( hint , hint ) do interesting things . 
^ i will leave that up to you . 
^ if you feel you still need some further guidance doing that , just read part &num of this tutorial .
