^ my jewish husband asked me to make chopped liver when we were planning to entertain some of our jewish friends . 
^ i had never made any kind of liver , so i did n't even know where to begin . 
^ i found your recipe , &name 's hungarian jewish &name &name , and followed it to the letter , even down to the hungarian paprika ( which was wonderful ) . 
^ everyone raved about the chopped liver , and there was not a drop left .

^ here are some tips for your seder preparation or your &name parties . 
^ better brisket . 
^ if brisket will be gracing your seder menu this year , here are a few tips for making it tender and juicy . 
^ in order to break down the tough muscle fibers in this cut of meat and allow the fat and collagen to melt throughout , making it moist and tender , you need to cook the brisket at a low temperature for a long time with plenty of moisture . 
^ brisket is a perfect candidate for your slow cooker , and you can convert any oven or stovetop recipe for use in this handy appliance . 
^ as a rule , you should cut the amount of liquid in half . 
^ for every pound of meat , allow about &num hours of cooking time on the ' low ' setting for melt-in-your-mouth brisket every time . 
^ to dye for . 
^ eggs you buy in the grocery store usually have a fine coating of oil on them to make them look glossy and help preserve them . 
^ however , this coating also prevents the shells from taking dye to their fullest extent . 
^ to remove the coating , gently wash your eggs in warm water and dish soap before dyeing them , and you 'll have the most brilliantly hued &name treasures you 've ever laid eyes on ! 
^ if you 're using the eggs in a hunt , never hide cracked eggs , and do n't leave the eggs out of refrigeration for more than &num hours . 
^ to be completely safe , fill plastic eggs with candy and toys and hide those instead . 
^ bake a &name . 
^ bake a batch of cupcakes and let the kids custom-decorate them like &name baskets . 
^ adorn the baskets with speckled candy eggs , jellybeans , gummy bunnies , and dyed green coconut ' grass . ' &name handles for the baskets out of pipe cleaners . 
^ to dye coconut , place it in a large plastic bag and add a few drops of food coloring . 
^ close the bag , making sure to trap a large amount of air inside it . 
^ hold it tightly shut and shake vigorously until the coconut has achieved even coloring . 
^ add more coloring if you like , until you 've got the perfect shade .
