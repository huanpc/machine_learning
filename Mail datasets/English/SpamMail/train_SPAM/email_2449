^ your bed has been turned down by your steward while you were outside walking the deck , looking at the stars . 
^ ( &name , were n't they ? 
^ have you ever seen so many ? ) some people have turned in already , taking with them a good video to watch back in their staterooms . 
^ someone 's in the hot tub , and there are a few enjoying a quite moment up on deck . 
^ i like this time of night . 
^ the solid thump of the stateroom door , shutting out the 93outside world &num and opening up a smaller one , the private &num : intimate and serene . 
^ the lights are low , the minibar 's stocked with goodies , soft music is playing from the &name by the bed . 
^ it 's very romantic and peaceful ; you can start dreaming even before you close your eyes . 
^ all night long the sea shimmers as the moon shifts , and in the morning you can peek out your portholes and see jagged emerald peaks silhouetted against the sky . 
^ have you discovered the pull-out table inside your bureau ? 
^ room service is available &num / &num , so at least once you owe it to yourself to dine in your stateroom , in that soft &name robe you found hanging in the closet . 
^ maybe tomorrow . 
^ let the sea rock you to sleep now , dreaming of morning , a steamy latte , breakfast in bed.
