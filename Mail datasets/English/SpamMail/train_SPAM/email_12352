^ if you have many friends or family , you know how hectic your life can get and how little time you have for yourself . ^  um of the biggest problems is not being able to say no. lets face it , when was the last time you said no to a friend or family member , even if you did n't have a lot of spare time ? ^ it is  um of the biggest problems when it comes to not having enough time to relax , but you can free up some time by just saying no. ^ yes , it is natural for us to want to please people , but research has shown that a woman typically spends about  um hours per week on tasks that she would rather not do . ^ that works out to be roughly  um hour per day and about  um days per year ! ^ now , you might be saying to yourself easier said than done , and i have to agree with you . ^ after all , you do n't want to insult the person requesting your help , nor do you want to feel stressed out or guilty for not helping the person in need . ^ we offer some simple ways to turn down time-consuming requests without feeling guilty about it . ^ try these ideas : ^ time to think most people will say yes when they feel pressured to answer immediately , so take your time to make a decision by telling the person that you will have to let them know the following day . ^ it will give you a day to make your decision and think about if you can afford the time to help out . ^ stop yourself before blurting out your answer ; it can wind up giving you the time you need to relax . ^ alternative offer instead of just saying no and not helping out , offer an alternative . ^ for instance , if someone asks you to help out by working an art fair , you can tell him or her that you cannot help work but you can donate some arts and crafts for the fair . ^ if you can find a way to help out without it taking up time , it makes your life a lot easier and less stressful . ^ if your plans change  um of the best ways of saying no to someone is to offer to help if your situation changes , that way you are leaving off in a friendly manner . ^ tell the person that you cannot help but should your situation change , you 'll contact them . ^ off the subject  har smart way to free you from the obligation of helping while making that person feel good towards you is by complimenting them after you explain that you cannot help them . ^ it can cushion the rejection while making that person feel good . ^ let us know if these techniques help you to just say no ! ^ we 'd love to hear from you . ^ (  ame  ame ) ^ thank you for your support of our sponsors . ^  ebsite or its employees , agents or affiliates be liable for damages resulting from the use of any information provided herein . ^ to unsubscribe by postal mail , please send your request to : ^  um  ame road ,  ame  um ^  ame  ame ,  ame  um ^  ame :  ame department </text_normal></message_body></message>
