^ dear at , 
^ i want to thank you personally for visiting our &name , inc. site on the world-wide web , and for downloading &name &name for windows &num , &num , me , &name , &name , and &num . 
^ &name &name is a great creative tool for students at every level ! 
^ if you ran into any difficulties with the download and / or installation process , there are some detailed step-by-step instructions available at our web site for easy reference : 
^ &website 
^ whether you downloaded &name &name to view the live &num models from the &name buildings &name , for a fast free and fun home design solution , or as part of a formal &name software evaluation process , please know that we want to help you maximize the success of your &num modeling , rendering , and walkthrough experience . 
^ if you already have some experience with click-and-drag-style drawing software , i think you will find the user-friendly methods in &name &name very familiar . 
^ however , because designworkshop is &num of the first applications to actually let you create and edit freely in &num space , there are some little things about our interface that you probably would n't guess for yourself . 
^ really , there are just &num special things you will need to know about : 
^ &num - the &name key 
^ &num - the space jump function , and 
^ &num - the projection lines . 
^ these are described concisely in the designworkshop help ( in the help menu ) , and they 're described in full detail in our free tutorial . 
^ if you have n't already downloaded the tutorial , i ca n't recommend it too highly - even if all you do is read the introduction for a quick conceptual overview . 
^ you 'll find the designworkshop tutorial free online at : 
^ &website 
^ when you 're ready to consider upgrading from &name &name to &name &name , a complete package including &name export , or to &name professional , with advanced rendering functions and direct read / write of &name &name files , you 'll be glad to know that &name provides deep educational price discounts . 
^ please see : 
^ &website 
^ i could go on and on about &name and the live &num design revolution - as generations of architecture students from my years as an &name professor can tell you - but i 'm really just supposed to be saying hello . 
^ so here 's the bottom line : if you have any questions or comments about &name &name , and / or its grown-up &name &name &name and &name professional , we would really love to hear from you . 
^ our technical support staff is online every day at &email or you can fax us in the &name anytime at &num . 
^ another great resource is the world-wide community of designworkshop users , including over &num , &num new designworkshop &name users in just the last year . 
^ you can hook up with them online anytime at the &name &num &name discussion , online at : 
^ &website 
^ when you 've made your first masterpiece with designworkshop , you 're invited to share it with the world , alongside the many impressive projects your fellow users have posted in our online &name gallery , at :

^ best wishes ,
