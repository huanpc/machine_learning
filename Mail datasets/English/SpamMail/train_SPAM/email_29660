^ with many states suffering from budget shortfalls , travel funds at many universities have been cut . 
^ therefore many of our participants are opting to participate via the &name division . 
^ for those of you who are interested , it enables you all of the same benefits as physically attending without the travel expenses . 
^ you can also submit a power point presentation to accompany your conference submission , which we will post on our web site during the conference . 
^ in addition to e-mailing comments back and forth directly , there will also be a message board for comments and questions to enhance your level of interaction . 
^ due to time zone differences , there is no set schedule for &name division participation . 
^ the submission procedures are the same whether you plan to physically attend or participate in the &name division ( see the link below for details on submitting ) .
