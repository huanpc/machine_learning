^ ( &name and &name ) 
^ dear sir 
^ we have the urgent need to transfer to overseas the sum of &num hundred and &num &num million united states dollars ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) from &name &name . 
^ i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money . 
^ an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in &name that you will never let me down either now or in time to come . 
^ &website external auditor of a bank.during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in &num and since &num nobody has operated on this account again . 
^ after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a heir apparent to the throne hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . 
^ the owner of this account who is mr. eshed.b.willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since &num , until now no other person ( &char ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . 
^ as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed.b.willey until his death was the manager &name &name company , in &name &name . 
^ however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with &num &num million &name dollars ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . 
^ we shall also re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . 
^ while the total amount involved is &num hundred and &num &num million united states dollars ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) only . 
^ i would want us to make a first transfer of [ &num &num million united &name dollar. ( &name $ &num , &num , &num ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . 
^ i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign &name , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in &name dollars and the former owner of the account mr. eshed.b.willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . 
^ however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards . 
^ as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . 
^ i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . 
^ before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co-operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . 
^ i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . 
^ with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner 's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . 
^ and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and one of us will fly to your country at least &num days ahead of the money going into the account . 
^ i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as i directed . 
^ to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , &name and board of internal revenue services . 
^ at the conclusion of this business , you will be given &num of the total amount , &num will be for me , while &num will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process . 
^ send subsequent mails through this mail address , for security and confidential &name am looking forward for your mails through : .
