^ &name hi &name , 
^ i 've never written an email like this before and i doubt i ever will again ... 
^ what 's so urgent that i felt the need to write you this kind of confidential email , you ask ? 
^ well , i just pulled off the deal of a lifetime that will benefit only a select group of people ( and that includes you ) . 
^ it 's our way of saying .thank you . 
^ for being a valued member . 
^ here 's the scoop ... 
^ like most successful entrepreneurs , i have my ' go-to ' guys that i turn to for help and guidance whenever &name &char faced with an online or offline marketing challenge that i must solve . 
^ now , by far , my number one ' go-to ' guy is &name &name ( i doubt &name 's name is familiar to you because as he puts it , he 's way too busy doing business instead of just playing business like many so-called gurus do today ) . 
^ anyway , &name 's &num dollar track record of homerun after homerun is almost scary ( i 've seen him turn marketing duds into million dollar homeruns in days ... and not just once ... but time and time again ) . 
^ and , because of the deal i just put together , you 're about to see just how powerful the trade secrets he developed ( with help from yours truly ) can be if you want to make money online . 
^ quick & easy - starting from &num . 
^ which brings me to the whole point of this email ... 
^ see , at a recent live seminar , &num of the people &name personally trained went through an ' interesting ' experience where he was ambushed and forced to prove the worth of these trade secrets live , without a net . 
^ anyway , as you can probably guess , this guy kicked butt ... and every single minute of this astonishing ' challenge ' was captured live on video that , until now , &name has only allowed a select group of ' insiders ' to watch . 
^ well , with a little ' arm-twisting ' from me , &name reluctantly agreed to let a few select members sneak a peak and watch ( right online ) these videos as he not only reveals his secrets , but proves that they work live- without rehearsal or warning ! 
^ so , here 's the bottom line : if you want to learn the real deal about making money &name & easy on the &name directly from a master who has a multi-million dollar success record , then you are crazy if you do n't drop whatever you 're doing right now and check out this amazing website :
