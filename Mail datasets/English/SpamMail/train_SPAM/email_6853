^ drinking and &name has become a deadly killer . 
^ if you or your loved &num drink , please drink responsibly and use our personal alcohol &name . 
^ it could be the difference of life and death . 
^ despite its micro size , the safe alcohol breath analyzer is a sensitive scientific instrument employing computer semiconductor technology to convert breath alcohol content to equivalent blood alcohol content ( &name ) within seconds at &num ( &num ) progressive key concentration levels denoted by an easily read , color coded led display . 
^ the safe employs the recently developed and most advanced * &name gas sensor which is alcohol specific eliminating the possible interference from other environmental factors . 
^ like all alcohol breath analyzers , the sensor microchip is gas specific , meaning that smoke of any kind , especially cigarette smoke , can adversely affect accurate readings . 
^ consequently , smokers should wait at least &num minutes prior to using the safe .

^ * &name is the abbreviation for &name systems , a technology developed at the university of &name at &name that employs miniscule silicon sensors or &quot;motes&quot; a.k. a &quot;smart dust&quot;. 
^ smart dust , as the name implies , is the equivalent of coating a receptor microchip with micro fine powder consisting of millions of individual smart sensor motes . 
^ the use of &name , or smart dust , exponentially increases the sensitivity and detection effectiveness of the receptor microchip in identifying and quantifying targeted molecules ( hydrocarbons in the case of alcohol breath analyzers ) . 
^ this increased sensitivity and accuracy however can be more readily compromised by cigarette smoke or other contaminates in the air . 
^ therefore it is extremely important that &name devices be used as free from ambient smoke as possible .
