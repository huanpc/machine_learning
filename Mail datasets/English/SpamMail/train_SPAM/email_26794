^ &name &name &num 
^ ' &char &name &name of bitter sunshine ' 
^ to : &name 's new ruling class ( &name ) from : &name &name ( &email ) &name : april &num 
^ &name status 
^ there are &num , &num members of &name . 
^ each of you is so sexy and brilliant , i 'm at a complete loss for ... um ... those things that are made out of letters and assembled into sentences . 
^ observations 
^ have you noticed that the longer you know people , the deafer you both get ? 
^ my theory is that it 's hard to listen to people you know , because they 've already used up all of their interesting stories , and now they 're just talking because they like it when noise comes out of their body . 
^ the conversational problem is compounded if the party in question tends to take things literally . 
^ when you 're dealing with a literal person , there 's no such thing as a simple conversation . 
^ for example , you might often have this sort of exchange : 
^ you : ' the moon looks beautiful tonight . ' 
^ literal person : ' which moon ? ' 
^ you : ' how many moons are there ? 
^ it 's night . 
^ we 're outdoors . 
^ i 'm looking up . ' 
^ literal person : ' you could have meant reverend moon of the &name church . ' 
^ you : ' you thought maybe he was here ? ' 
^ literal person : ' you did n't say , ' the one in the sky . ' you just blurted it out . 
^ how was i supposed to read your mind ? 
^ now i hate you . ' 
^ your only defense against the scourge of conversational familiarity is to pretend to listen , and occasionally contribute phrases such as , ' i totally agree ' and ' you could n't be more right . ' sometimes you 'll be caught off guard with a multiple-choice question . 
^ if that happens , my experience is that the second choice is always the best . 
^ the first choice is usually a fake-out , and the third one is a last minute add-on just to make the question more difficult . 
^ &name &name 
^ it 's a cruel , induhvidual-infested world , and you need some strategies for entertaining yourself . 
^ here are some ideas from &name operatives in the field . 
^ &num of my co-workers related how , as a child , his little brother stole a quarter of his birthday cake without being detected . 
^ he lifted the cake , sliced a horizontal layer off the bottom , and put the cake back on the dish . 
^ 'must have fallen ' was his mother 's comment . 
^ [ note : that future &name member really takes the cake . ] 
^ here 's a fun hobby of mine : when i get e-mail spam that includes an 800-number , i save the number for later . 
^ then when &num of the hundreds of nigerian scam e-mails hits my e-mail box , i reply enthusiastically and give the 800-number of the spammer as my own . 
^ i feel that people in the &name have a responsibility to introduce a-holes to each other . 
^ when you call a business and get put on hold , there are some musical choices that are especially fitting . 
^ here are &num that have been used on our system : 
^ - send in the clowns . 
^ - it do n't matter to me . 
^ [ note : another good choice : ' i ca n't get no ( &name ) ' . ] 
^ quotes from &name 
^ &name &name members continue to send me true quotes of &name . 
^ here are some of the best . 
^ ' he 's not the brightest cookie in the lamp . ' 
^ ' &name is difficult , especially when it involves the future . ' 
^ ' that thing was jumping up and down like a sieve . ' 
^ ' we will be downsizing , and hopefully people will be leaving through nutrition . ' 
^ ' hold on ; the roller coaster is just leaving the dock . ' 
^ ' i have a photogenic memory and a near-genius &name ! ' 
^ ' i 've got a bone in my bonnet about this . ' 
^ ' they are raising the bar and they want us to jump through it . ' 
^ ' we 've burned the first bridge , but we 're not out of the woodwork yet . ' 
^ ' well , you finished that project by the skin of your pants ! ' 
^ ' that idea went over like a ball of wax . ' 
^ ' you still have &num minutes , as the crow flies . ' 
^ a basketball player recently commented that since his trade , ' everything has been peaches and gravy . ' 
^ ' it 's not wrong ; it 's just not specific enough . ' 
^ my boss tried to compliment my memory the other day , with the assertion that i 'must have a real data suppository in my head . ' 
^ ' not the sharpest knife in the deck . ' 
^ ' off the cuff of my head , i do n't know . ' 
^ ' he 's been beating his head around the bush for a long time . '

^ &name &name my mail 
^ in this section , &name answers my mail that i 'm too polite to answer myself . 
^ the names have been changed to make them funnier . 
^ dear &name , 
^ while visiting a friend in a nearby office , i spied a box of chocolates made available for anyone who wanted some . 
^ i took &num and happily gobbled it down . 
^ no one saw me take it . 
^ i figure there was only enough for each employee in the office to have &num piece . 
^ was it ethical to finish the entire box as long as no one noticed ? 
^ &name 
^ dear &name , 
^ yes , that is perfectly ethical . 
^ but i recommend leaving a chocolate-smeared napkin at the entrance to your friend 's cubicle . 
^ that is even more ethical . 
^ sincerely , 
^ &name 
^ doctor &name 's advice 
^ lately , i 've been noticing that dr. &name , the radio doctor , has been giving bad advice . 
^ so as a public service , i have taken some of the questions from her web site and have asked dr. &name to give the correct advice . 
^ question &num 
^ &name 's husband was arrested for solicitation . 
^ he is on trial and would like &name to attend the trial . 
^ should she ? 
^ &name 's answer 
^ &name should attend the trial . 
^ she should wear a short skirt , huge pumps , and occasionally yell , ' i want my money ! ' 
^ question &num 
^ &name 's oldest daughter , who is &num , is beginning to develop a weight problem . 
^ the daughter would like to go on a diet . 
^ &name wants to keep her daughter 's self-esteem high . 
^ should &name put her on a diet ? 
^ &name 's answer 
^ the daughter is fine . 
^ but &name should put her own fat head on a diet for asking this question , because now every 10-year-old girl with a mother named &name is going to have a tough day in school . 
^ question &num 
^ &name 's 15-year-old daughter is acting up . 
^ most recently , she dyed her hair multiple colors . 
^ should &name punish her daughter , and if so , how ? 
^ &name 's answer 
^ it is redundant to punish a girl who dyes her hair multiple colors . 
^ but if you feel it 's absolutely necessary , i recommend a tattoo .
