^ parents of 15-year-old find $ &num , &num cash hidden in his closet . 
^ true story -- seen on national news program ' &name &num makes &num thousand in &num weeks ! ' 
^ does this headline look familiar ? 
^ you may have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program in the &name . 
^ his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . 
^ nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . 
^ five-dollar bills , &num , &num and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles . 
^ 'my first thought was that he had robbed a bank ' , says the 41-year-old woman , ' there was over $ &num , &num dollars in that bag - that 's more than my husband earns in a year ! 
^ ' 
^ the woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . 
^ he came home right away and they drove together to the boy 's school and picked him up . 
^ little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . 
^ as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e-mail , a type of ' report ' to e-mail addresses that he obtained off of the &name . 
^ everyday after school for the past &num months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . 
^ ' i just got the e-mail &num day and i figured ' what the heck ? ' . 
^ i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out , ' says the clever 15-year-old . 
^ the e-mail letter listed &num addresses and contained instructions to send &num $ &num dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list dropping the number &num person off the list ( because they had already made their millions ) . 
^ the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . 
^ ' i get junk e-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work , ' the boy continues . 
^ within the first few days of sending out the e-mail , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up not with magazines , but with envelopes containing $ &num bills . 
^ ' about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it . 
^ there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter . 
^ i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) . ' he goes on , ' i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . 
^ i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all . ' 
^ over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e-mail . 
^ ' the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet . 
^ i barely had time for my homework . ' 
^ in fact , everything the boy did was completely legal according to &name &name and &name &name , &name &num , section &num and &num , or title &num , section &num in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , &name &num , sections &num and &num , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . 
^ here is the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by e-mail . 
^ you can do the exact same thing he was doing , simply by following the instructions in this letter . 
^ dear friends : 
^ as seen on national tv : making over half million dollars every &num to &num months from your home for an investment of only $ &num &name dollars expense &num time . 
^ all thanks to the computer age and the &name ! 
^ be a millionaire like others within a year on the net ! ! 
^ before you say ' nonsense ' , please read the following : 
^ my name is &name &name and i have taken ' the letter ' and put on a web page for easier reading . 
^ there is also a text file there you will need to download when you decide to join the program , which you will surely do after you have read the logic in it . 
^ note : you cannot use the text of the letter on the web site by copy / pasting it . 
^ it wo n't look right in an email , unless you know how to use html . 
^ you will need to download the text file provided for you , or you can email me and i will send you the letter through email . 
^ i am a real person and you can write to me to ask questions about this . 
^ you must use the address on the website to correspond with me directly ( do n't just click reply on this email - i get a lot of email at that address and i may miss yours . ) 
^ to finish reading about this program that can make you very rich in a short amount of time , please click here . 
^ i appreciate you taking the time to read this , and i hope that you will do what i have done and join the program . 
^ it is perfectly legal , and when i sent my $ &num dollars out to each person on the list , i received all of my reports in less than a week , and some of these people were in &name and &name ! 
^ and if for some reason , you do n't receive a report from someone within a week or so , simply write to me and let me know , and i will send you the report that you are missing , so you will have all the information you need . 
^ but all the people that are in my downline ( who will also be in your downline ) sent the report in less than a week after my order , and these people were mostly from &name and &name . 
^ the point is , it works if you want it to work . 
^ it 's a lot easier than all those ' work at &name opportunities ' you get through email , and once you have signed up , i will help you and answer your questions to the best of my abilities . 
^ because , after all , the more emails you send out , the more $ &num bills you and i both receive . 
^ the same goes for you helping the people in your downline . 
^ it 's a very friendly process , and i 've yet to meet anyone out of the &num people i bought my reports from who did not answer my questions and try to help me as best they could . 
^ i will do the same for you . 
^ i hope you will join the program . 
^ it really can change your life . 
^ this is a one-time mailing , but since i am new to bulk emailing , i would also like to give you the option of going to this page to add your name to my remove list . 
^ that way , you will be on there for sure . 
^ my software automatically takes your name off of the mailing list once you have been sent an email from me , although it is possible that you may receive emails at different addresses . 
^ it only goes by email addresses ( not by names ) and cannot tell if your name is on several different email accounts . 
^ i 'm sincerely sorry if i am bothering you with this email , and even more sorry if you receive it at several of your accounts . 
^ there really is no need to use the remove feature , but it is there for you , and if you do put your name in , i will check to be absolutely sure that you are in the remove file . 
^ this is not like other companies that say , ' it may take a week or &num to get you out of our mailing system . ' i am &num person and i have only &num remove file , and once you 've received an email at your address , your address goes in that remove file . 
^ thank you for your time , and i sincerely hope that you get rich beyond your wildest expectations , so you can quit that boring job and not worry about bills anymore . 
^ just go on vacation whenever you want ( and get your mama to check the &name office box while you 're gone to collect your $ &num bills - she can email you the addresses and you can use your laptop computer to mail out your reports while you 're sitting on the beach in &name . 
^ that 's my plan anyway . ) &smiley 
^ even if you decide this program is not for you , i wish you the best of luck in life , and hope that you will prosper in all that you do . 
^ we all deserve to live a good life . 
^ sincerely yours , &name &name please click here now to change your life forever . 
^ there are complete removal instructions at the top of that page . 
^ best of luck to you ! ! 
^ under &name &name title &num passed by the 105th &name &name this letter cannot be considered spam as long as the sender includes contact information and a method of removal . 
^ you may like to know that this is a &num time e-mail transmission , i will not email you again . 
^ your name is automatically removed from my list after i have emailed you once .
