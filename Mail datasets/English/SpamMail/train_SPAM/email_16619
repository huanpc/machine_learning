^ okay , let 's cut through the bull crap . 
^ times are hard right now . 
^ &name is on the brink of war , people are getting laid off left and right and no one knows when it is going to end . 
^ you may or may not be an american that is having to deal with financial uncertainty . 
^ there is a way we can help each other out . 
^ events like &num / &num have proven that americans can pull together and help one another . 
^ i truly believe this is the case . 
^ here is your chance , our chance , to help each other out and make a bunch of money ( legally of course ) doing so . 
^ if you are interested then please read on , if not , then forward this to someone you think may be interested . 
^ &name the instructions below and you could potentially make thousands upon thousands of dollars in a few short months . 
^ i am going to make this short and sweet . 
^ listed below are &num ( &num ) names and addresses . 
^ send each person a &num dollar bill wrapped in &num sheets of paper so people can not see the money through the envelope , money will make people do strange things . 
^ you are ordering reports from these individuals that discuss many creative ways to make money on the &name . 
^ the person in position &num in the address list below will be sending you report &num , the person in position &num will email you report &num and so on all the way to postion &num and report &num . 
^ so in each letter , include a &num dollar bill wrapped in &num sheets of paper . 
^ you will also need to include your name , the report number you are ordering and your email address so they can email you the reports . 
^ send the individual in position &num $ &num instead of $ &num . 
^ i will explain why later in this email. * you may be asking yourself at this point why you are about to send $ &num up a wild hog 's rear end ? 
^ well , the cool thing is that you are not , because it is about to come back to you many times over . 
^ after you have sent out the &num dollar bills to everyone on the list ( remember , $ &num for report &num ) then you will need to do the following : &num . ) remove the name and address from the number &num position . 
^ this individual ( if they followed the instructions and did not cheat ) probably just made a quan load of cash so it is okay to boot them off the list . 
^ &num . ) move all the names and addresses down &num position . 
^ for example , move the name and address from position &num to &num , from &num to &num , from &num to &num , and from &num to &num . 
^ &num . ) add your name and address to the first position . 
^ you are now able to accept orders for report &num . 
^ this is a good thing . 
^ &num . ) find &name people to do the same thing and participate in this program ! 
^ this is very important and the more people the merrier ! ! 
^ you can do this a variety of different ways . 
^ i found my &num people through family and friends and told them to do likewise . 
^ it has worked wonderfully for me . 
^ you will want to find way more than &num if possible . 
^ the more people you find to participate in the beginning determines how much flow you make in the end . 
^ you should set a personal goal of at least &num orders for report &num , although a &num would be much better . 
^ send this email to as many people as you can and send out emails everyday . 
^ summary of instructions : send &num $ in cash to positions &num through &num on the list . 
^ send $ &num in cash to position &num . 
^ modify this email by removing the name and address in the number &num position , move &num to &num , &num to &num , &num to &num , &num to &num , and then &name your name and address to the number &num position . 
^ send the newly edited email to everyone you know and you may even want to &name some email lists and send it to them as well . 
^ the &name &name to get this thing off the ground is by using contacts through friends and family . 
^ what is possible ? : if everyone did what they were susposed to do and found &num people to participate , this is the payments you could receive while your name moves through the list and you fill ordesrs for the reports : with your name in the number &num position , &num people send $ &num : &num &char $ &num $ &num with your name in the number &num position , &num people send $ &num : &num &char $ &num $ &num with your name in the number &num position , &num people send $ &num : &num , &num &char $ &num $ &num , &num with your name in the number &num position , &num people send $ &num : &num , &num &char $ &num $ &num , &num * with your name in the number &num position , &num , &num people send $ &num : &num , &num &char $ &num $ &num , &num , &num * now you see why the person in the &num position gets $ &num instead of $ &num ? 
^ it is because by the time their name gets to the &num spot , they should get many , many envelopes being sent ot them so by paying them $ &num , they ( you ) get double money but them being able to participate still just cost $ &num &num time . 
^ so is this &char &name ? 
^ it would be natural for any &num to think it was , it is only human to think so . 
^ what you have to ask yourself is , what if it is not a scam and you do not participate ? 
^ that is an easy one to answer , you just missed out on an easy money making oppurtunity that only required a $ &num investment . 
^ can you really afford to not do this ? 
^ i am doing this because in &num month i will be getting laid off as well and quite frankly i am scared to death of this fact . 
^ not only is this not a scam , but it is completely legal . 
^ we have good products that we are selling ( the reports ) and the &name is how we are marketing these reports . 
^ i am doing this for my family , if you do not want to do this for your family , then do it for yourself . 
^ maybe there is a new car you have been looking at , maybe you do not know exactly how you are going to send little junior or &name to college ? 
^ or , maybe so many people hit you up for loans that you have nothing else to give and when you need something , no one will do anything for you ( hey , what are friends for ) . 
^ maybe it is just time to do something good for yourself . 
^ do this today .. you will be glad you did .. the &name list here is the current list of participants : &name report # &num ( $ &num ) ' the insider 's guide for &name for free on the &name ' from : &name &name &num &name &name road &num &name , &name &num &name report # &num ( $ &num ) ' the insider 's guide to sending bulk email on the &name ' from : &name &name &num &name &name # &num &name , &name &num &name report # &num ( $ &num ) ' the secret to &name marketing on the &name ' from : &name downs &num &name &name &name , &name &num &name report # &num ( $ &num ) ' how to become a millionaire using &name and the net ' from : &name &name &num &name avenue &name , &name &num &name report # &num ( $ &num ) ' how to send out &num million emails for free ' from : &name june &name &name &num &name , &name &num remember to include your name and email address on &num of the pieces of paper in the envelope ( and the money of course ) so they know where to email your report . 
^ this is your chance to change the &name you live . 
^ do not pass this up . 
^ the news gets worse and worse everyday . 
^ if we &name to war , things will get much worse before they get better . 
^ if you have just been inching by or you are worried that you may have to , then start this program today ... your earning potential is unlimited . 
^ this is a &num time mailing , no need to be removed from the list . 
^ this progams is perfectly legal , if you have any question you may forward them to the office of associate director for marketing practices federal &name &name , bureau of consumer protection , &name &name . 
^ good luck ! ! !
