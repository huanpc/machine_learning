^ during the current war against the farmers in &name from the supporters of president &name &name , in his effort to chase all the white farmers out of the country , he ordered all the white farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and his followers . 
^ my father was &num of the most successful farmers in my country but he did not support the idea of dispossessing the white farmers of their land . 
^ because of this , his farm was invaded and burnt by the government &name the course of the attack , my father was killed , and the invaders made away with a lot of items from my father 's farm . 
^ and our family &name was utterly destroyed . 
^ my mother died too out of heart attack . 
^ before the death of my father , he drew my attention to the &name of us $ &num million , which he deposited with a security company in europe when the problem with &name came up . 
^ my sister and i decided to move out of &name for our security to &name . 
^ till date the security company is not aware of the content of the consignment because my father used his diplomatic immunity as at that time to deposit the consignment as important personal valuables . 
^ i decided to have contact with overseas person who will assist me to receive and invest this money into real estate business and buying stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments .
