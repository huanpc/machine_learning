^ it does n't have to be that way 
^ dear &name , 
^ are you like most of us , carrying around several credit cards in your wallet ? 
^ oh , you got the department store card because they offered a discount on the tv you bought if you would apply for a credit card at the same time . 
^ you got that super-duper visa card because they were offering a great ' introductory rate ' . 
^ of course , you learned later that the 'real rate ' was n't any better than your previous card . 
^ you look back and you have somehow managed to end up with a lot of high interest debt . 
^ if you can manage to pay the minimum you may have it paid off in , oh , let 's say &num years . 
^ how did it all go so wrong ? 
^ if you 're like so many others , you 're carrying this heavy load on your back everyday . 
^ but it does n't have to be that way . 
^ it will take some effort , but you can start your own home-based business today and start making additional income to pay down that debt .

^ sincerely ,
