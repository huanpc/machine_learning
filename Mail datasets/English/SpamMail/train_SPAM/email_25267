^ the following article is from the weekly magazine in &name , b.c. , the &name &name . 
^ it discusses a speech on whistle blowing by &name 's executive director &name court . 
^ court 's latest book -- &name : how corporate &name steals your personal freedom and what to do about it -- is due out from &name on memorial &name , may 26th . 
^ &name your calender now to remember to pick up a copy . 
^ &name &name ' corporateers ' harm society 
^ by' &name &name 
^ &char &name consumer watchdog gave a &name audience a lesson in ' corporateering ' on march &num . 
^ &name &name , executive director of the california-based foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights , defined corporateering as how ' commerce changes social mores as well as the rule of law and ethics ' to harm individuals and benefit corporations . 
^ ' a corporateer is someone who practises corporateering , ' &name said at a public forum on corporate and government accountability held at the &name public library . 
^ for example , &name said , corporateering could involve forcing employees to sign noncompetition agreements that take away their intellectual property and freedom of association by preventing them from working for competitors . 
^ he said that the installation of surveillance systems in the workplace is another example of corporateering because this violates individuals ' privacy rights . 
^ ' there have been reports that people routinely have their e-mail read and sometimes have their voice mail monitored , and some people have actually been fired for making phone calls in the workplace , ' he said . 
^ court has worked with several corporate ' whistleblowers' --people who alert authorities and the public to wrongdoing in the workplace--whom he described as the 'most courageous people in our society ' . 
^ he cited &num such examples in his speech : dr. &name &name , a medical director at the &name -based health-care corporation humana , who alerted &name to the company denying medically necessary treatments to patients ; &name &name &name , an &name insurance employee who revealed fraud in the way the company responded to house-insurance claims following an earthquake ; and an unnamed accountant who successfully sued his former employer on behalf of the government after the company kept &num sets of books so it could bilk taxpayers out of hundreds of millions of dollars . 
^ however , &name said that corporateering--placing the corporation 's priorities above those of the individual--has made it easier for companies to isolate and retaliate against whistleblowers . 
^ ' there is no long-term protection , ' &name said . 
^ ' there is no value in playing this role . ' 
^ court 's new book , &name : how corporate &name steals your personal freedom ... and what you can do about it ( &name &name &name / &name ) , cites &num &name laws to counter corporateering and explains how the public can use them to hold companies more accountable . 
^ another speaker at the forum , &name &name of the ottawa-based group democracy watch , told the audience that &name lags far behind the united states in providing protection for whistleblowers . 
^ &name said that only &num federal laws--those dealing with environmental protection , human rights , labour , and competition--give people the right to blow the whistle . 
^ none require the person to do this . 
^ ' in all of those &num laws , there is no one to go to blow the whistle [ to ] who is empowered to investigate as well as protect the whistleblower from retaliation , ' &name said . 
^ he contrasted that with &num federal laws in the united states that provide whistleblower protection , as well as laws in &num states giving general protection for blowing the whistle on violations of the law by any corporate or government entity . 
^ ' there is only &num province , &name &name , that has a general law , ' &name said . 
^ ' once again , there is no place to go that will protect you as a member of the public or as an employee . ' 
^ &name said that whistleblower protection is an essential ingredient in accountability over political financing , government ethics , and the handling of access-to-information requests . 
^ ' if the employees in the know are not empowered to share what they know , the regulators can only ever get so close to the inside operations of any government or corporate institution and hold them accountable for unethical behaviour , ' he said . 
^ ' whistleblower protection is a very key method of closing a key gap in a lot of the accountability measures and accountability systems that we have been trying to build up in &name and in other countries . 
^ because it is such a key measure , we do n't have whistleblower protection in &name . ' 
^ &name also said that corporations do not want their internal systems and reputation publicized , so they fight any attempt to impose accountability measures . 
^ ' the only reason that the polls have shown , i believe , in past years more faith by canadians in business as opposed to governments is because businesses do not have access-to-information laws , ethics laws , or any kind of accountability measures where governments have , ' he said . 
^ 'so all of their wrongdoing remains secret , behind closed doors , shuffled away . 
^ this has been admitted by people who do audits of corporations . 
^ most corporate fraud is dealt with quietly , and the person is let go and losses are buried in the books . ' 
^ the foundation for taxpayer & consumer rights ability to keep doing this work rests with people like you . 
^ your financial support will really make a difference .
