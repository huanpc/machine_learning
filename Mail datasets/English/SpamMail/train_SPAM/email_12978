^ dear sir , 
^ i am dr &name &name , the &name manager of &name bank of &name &name , &name &name lagos , and i have the mandate of some of the directors of the bank to look for a reliable and trust worthy foreigner that will assist us in the transfer of us $ 26million into his foreign account . 
^ source of the fund : in the past board of directors meetings , this amount had been found floating in the company 's account resulting in an excess profit of us $ 26million , this has caused a delay in declaring the company 's ( &name ) bi-annual balance sheet to shareholders , and since this amount has not been made known to the management and shareholders of the bank , directors decided to employ the services of an account auditor who is a son-in-law to &num of the directors . 
^ who in the cause of investigation , discovered it is an unclaimed contract fund of a foreign contractor , who was paid through our bank . 
^ this findings arose the interest of my colleagues , who through further investigation discovered that the contractor was ( &name . 
^ reginard tuner a briton ) who died in &num of the &name plane crash some years back . 
^ every effort have been made to contact his relations and next of keen to kin . 
^ sequel to this , my colleagues concluded that it will be unwise if this amount is declared to the public and be shared among shareholders of the bank . 
^ rather in view of this i was mandated to look for a foreigner who will assume the next of keen of the dead contractor ( &name . 
^ reginard turner ) and provide us with an account number that will hold the said amount to enable us transfer the amount into the foreigner 's account in the foreigners name and banking particulars for our mutual benefits . 
^ this on conclusion would be shared among us . 
^ my colleagues have agreed to give you &num of the amount for your assistance while the remaining &num will be left for us to share . 
^ please be adviced that this business must be made very confidential , and its urgency demands your immediate response upon the receipt of this letter to enable us furnish you with the full details of what to do , so that the transfer process will commence immediately . 
^ feel free to ask questions where you are not cleared . 
^ looking forward for your immediate response through my e-mail address above or altanatively &email or you can reach me on my private telephone number-234-8042137980 . 
^ best regards , 
^ dr. &name &name
