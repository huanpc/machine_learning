^ to this effect my colleagues and i have agreed to compensate you with &num of the total sum us $ 2.9m for your kind assistance i.e. provision of a nominated foreign account to accommodate the fund for us . 
^ please , you have been advised to keep ' top secret ' as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you . 
^ i will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask me to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated . 
^ all other necessary vital information will be sent to you when i hear from you . 
^ i look forward to receive your mail for now . 
^ yours faithfully , &name &name .
