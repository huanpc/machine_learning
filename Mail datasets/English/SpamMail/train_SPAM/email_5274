^ wow what a night 
^ &name , you would n't even believe the night i had . 
^ my wife and i were out eating dinner , luckily we found a babysitter because my neighbors daughter was staying at home during college break . 
^ during the meal my wife , who was on call , got called into work . 
^ this ruined my night , or so i thought . 
^ when i arrived home it was about 10pm , the babysitter had put little &name to sleep and was to my amazement cleaning the kitchen . 
^ ( we didnt even ask her to do this ) 
^ i let her finish cleaning the kitchen , it was spotless ! 
^ i decided she needed a reward , and since i was a bartender in my younger days i decided to make us a few drinks . 
^ well &num thing led to another , and we both had all of our clothes off and were going at it . 
^ she was amazing , so young , so tender , and oh so delicious . 
^ we did it on the bar , the kitchen table , and the finally in the bedroom , i felt like i was back in college again , it was amazing ! 
^ it was now 3am i had to get some sleep , i paid her for babysitting and sent her home with a huge smile on her face . 
^ ( i 'll have to hire a babysitter more often ! ! )
