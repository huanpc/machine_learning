^ &char rapid every mile 
^ &quot;author &name &name once wrote that a river ' has so many things to say that it is hard to know what it says to each of us . ' whatever the message , &num of the surest ways to hear it is to live in the wild presence of a river for at least a few days . 
^ &name runs six-day trips down &name 's middle fork of the salmon , which tumbles through a hundred rapids in a hundred miles . 
^ water levels permitting , the group put in at &num , 740-foot boundary creek and plunges a heart-stopping &num feet a mile during the first &num miles , then surfs and spins through dense forests , grassy meadows , and imposing canyons until the take-out at the &name &name . 
^ &quot;why this trip : instead of rushing down the river , this outfit allows plenty of time for hiking , exploring caves , and basking in hot springs.&quot;

^ bored with &name 's picture perfect beaches ? 
^ head inland to discover the best &name rafting west of anywhere . 
^ by &name &name 
^ &quot;i do not surf . 
^ i do not dive . 
^ and i have little patience for baking in the sun . 
^ so it 's no wonder that &name , a 300-plus-island archipelago in the &name &name that 's known for its waves , reefs , and white-sand beaches ( and as a byway for captain &name ) , was barely on my radar . 
^ but a few months ago , i visited &name to watch the &num &name , the grueling multisport competition , and found that the interior of &name 's biggest island , the &num , 010-square-mile &name &name , is packed with rain forests , rivers , and mountains . 
^ &name &name , which airs in april on the &name &name , and a handful of new outfitters setting up shop on &name &name are helping to redefine &name as an adventure-sports &name with the &name &name 's best hiking , mountain biking , and river rafting ... 
^ &quot;nadi , on the western coast of &name &name , is home to the island 's international airport and is a good base for hiking and mountain biking trips ... 
^ &quot;from nadi , drive &num hours east along the reef-fringed &name coast to the town of &name harbour , the headquarters of &name rafting outfitter river 's &name . 
^ the &name &name river ( class &num with some class &num surprises ) is your final destination . 
^ you 'll squeeze through 130-foot-high walls of black volcanic stone , topped with rain forest and waterfalls , which narrow to just &num feet in width - still plenty broad , i learned , for jumping out and floating feet first whenever the urge strikes . 
^ &quot;pacific harbour also happens to have world-class diving and surfing , but that 's not why you 'll be there , is it?&quot;
