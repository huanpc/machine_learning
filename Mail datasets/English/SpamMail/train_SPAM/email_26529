^ &name , &name , 
^ i am ( &name &name ) &name manager ecobank &name , &name &name &name &name . 
^ i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you . 
^ on april &num , &num , a foreign oil consultant / contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation , mr. &name &name made a numbered time ( &name ) deposit for some months , valued at us $ &num , &num , &num ( &num million &num hundred thousand dollars only ) in my branch . 
^ upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . 
^ after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , the nigerian national petroleum corporation that mr. &name &name died on &num &name &num in a plane crash on air &name , aircraft name &name &name hs-748 . 
^ this crash happened in &name , &name , &name and the registration number of the aircraft is 6av-aeo , and since his untimely death the fund and his account has been dormant with my bank without any claim of the fund.further investigation , i found out that he died without making &char will , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . 
^ i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr. &name &name did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . 
^ this sum of us $ &num , &num , &num has been in this bank without any &num ever coming forward to claim it . 
^ according to nigerian law , at the expiration of &num ( &num ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government with some percentage going to the bank , if nobody applies to claim the fund . 
^ consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as his next of kin . 
^ on this note the bank board of directors and &char as the branch manager will have no option than to approve your claim , this will look as if you are aware of this deposit before now . 
^ i am writing you because i as a civil servant , we can not operate a foreign account.therefore i want to present you as the next of kin , so you can be able to put claim to the ( fund ) with our help . 
^ all these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man 's labour will not get into the hands of our corrupt government officials who will only corner the money into their private account as always the case with our official office holders . 
^ this is simple , i will provide you the text of the application immediately you send to me full intenaries you will like us to use for &name , so that we will prepare the necessary documents which will put you as the bonafide beneficiary of the fund . 
^ the money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of &num for us and &num for you and &num will take care of all expenses we may incure ranging from phone calls . 
^ there is no risk at all as i and my assitant have taken care of all the paperwork that will make this transaction a success , i will only guarantee you the successful execution of this transaction . 
^ if you are interested , please reply immediately via my email address or call me upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant information that will help you understand the transaction better . 
^ please observe with utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country base on your advice . 
^ lastly , you must not inform your bank or any &num about this transaction untill we have gotten the approvals ready .
