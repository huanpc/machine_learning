^ dr. &name &name director : project implementation nigerian national petroleum corporation . 
^ &name . 
^ &name : &num . 
^ &name : &num . 
^ dear sir , 
^ we are sending you this letter based on the information gathered from the foreign trade office of the nigerian chamber of commerce and industry . 
^ we believed that you would be in a position to help in our bid to transfer the sum of &num million , &num hundred thousand dollars ( &name &num million ) into a foreign account . 
^ we are members of the special committee for budget and planning of the ministry of petroleum . 
^ this committee is principally concerned with contract appraisals and approval of contracts in order of priorities as regard capital project of the federal government of &name . 
^ with our positions , we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of &num million , &num hundred thousand united &name dollars ( &name &num million ) . 
^ this amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall from the sales of crude oil during and after the gulf war . 
^ what we need from you is to provide a confidential account into which the funds will be transferred since we are government officials and we are not allowed by our laws to operate foreign accounts . 
^ it has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with &num of the remitted funds , we will keep &num while the remaining &num will be set aside for expenses and to pay the necessary taxes . 
^ it may interest you to know that &num years ago a similar transaction was carried out with &num mr. &name &name , the president of &name international trading corporation at &name &num , east 57th street , 28th floor , &name &name , &num with telephone number ( &num ) &num and telex number &num . 
^ after the agreement between both partners in which he was to take &num , the money was duly transferred into his account only to be disappointed on our arrival in &name &name , as we were reliably informed that mr. &name &name was no longer in that address while his telephone numbers and telex number have been reallocated to someone else . 
^ all effort to locate mr. &name proved abortive and consequently we lost the sum of &name &num million to mr. &name &name . 
^ this time we never intend to lose our money and we needed to search for a more reliable person with a strong business interest , a trustworthy person of a reputable company , hence this letter to you . 
^ if you can prove yourself to be trust worthy and you are interested in this business , then we are prepared to do business with you . 
^ what we want from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share when this amount of &name &num million is transferred into your account . 
^ if this proposal satisfies you , please send your response only through e-mail or fax so that we can advise you on the modalities of this transaction and forward to me a confidential telephone and fax numbers through which i can reach you . 
^ all modalities for the transfer have been worked out and once started will not take more than &num working days with the absolute support of all concerned . 
^ this transaction is &num safe . 
^ please treat as urgent and very confidential . 
^ we await your immediate response . 
^ yours faithfully , 
^ dr. &name &name
