^ &name , my name is &char &name . 
^ you may have seen this business before and ignored it . 
^ i know i did - many times ! 
^ so take a few moments to read this letter . 
^ you will be amazed when the profit potential of this business sinks in. .. i know i was ! 
^ with easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail lists , success in this business is now fast and easy . 
^ its even been easy enough for ordinary people like me , who do n't know much about internet marketing . 
^ follow the instructions below and you will not have to worry whether a recession is coming or not , who is president , or whether you keep your current job or not . 
^ yes , i know what you are thinking . 
^ i never responded to &num of these before either . 
^ but something just clicked &num day , and i found myself saying ' you spend $ &num going to a movie for &num hours with the wife ... what the heck ! ' i thank every day for that feeling to just go for it ! 
^ &char cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be doing had i not . 
^ &name on . 
^ it really works ! 
^ the earning potential is staggering ! 
^ and , its legal ! 
^ as seen on national tv : be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! 
^ make $ &num , &num every &num to &num months from home . 
^ this is the same letter you probably heard about on the news lately . 
^ due to its popularity on the internet , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program to see if it really can make people money . 
^ the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . 
^ their findings proved there are ' absolutely no laws prohibiting participation in the program and if people can ' follow the instructions ' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ &num ' out of pocket ' cost ' . 
^ when you follow the instructions , you are simply buying and selling something of value . 
^ so now lets talk about how and what you need to do next ! 
^ how to get started on your road to financial freedom ! 
^ below is a list of &num reports and where to order them from . 
^ you order each report for $ &num . 
^ within a few days you 'll receive , via e-mail , each report from those &num different addresses . 
^ those reports include all the marketing information you need , including how to send bulk e-mails legally , and how to place free classified ads , and more . 
^ now its a matter of processing the orders as they come in. for every $ &num you receive , you e-mail your customer the report they ordered . 
^ that 's it ! 
^ if you provide same day service on all orders , you guarantee the e-mail your customer sends out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt . 
^ &name , they cannot advertise until they receive their reports , right ! 
^ you should receive at least &num orders for report # &num within &num weeks . 
^ continue advertising and sending e-mails until you do . 
^ &num to &num weeks after that you should receive &num orders or more for report # &num . 
^ now you can relax , because the system is working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in. every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . 
^ you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . 
^ if you want to generate more income , send another batch of emails to start the whole process again . 
^ there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! 
^ the reason for cash is not because this is illegal or somehow ' wrong ' . 
^ it is simply about time . 
^ it takes time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc. and we suggest everyone wrap their $ &num cash in &num sheets of paper , to protect it , so no &num can &name there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . 
^ what not to do ! 
^ do not the names of people listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in steps &num through &num or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . 
^ once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it will not work if you change it . 
^ remember , this method has been tested , and if you it , it will not work ! ! ! 
^ people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all &num thinking they could get all the money . 
^ but it does not work this way . 
^ believe us , some have tried to be greedy and were very disappointed when nothing happened . 
^ so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . 
^ remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! 
^ this is a legitimate business . 
^ you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it . 
^ treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time . 
^ how does this business work ? 
^ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only &num , &num e-mails each . 
^ let 's also assume that the mailing only receives &num responses per &num , &num emails sent ( &num ) . 
^ many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only &num , &num each . 
^ continuing with this example , you send out only &num , &num e-mails . 
^ with a &num response , that is only &num orders for report # &num . 
^ those &num people responded by sending out &num , &num e-mails each for a total of &num , &num . 
^ out of those &num , &num e-mails only &num responded with orders . 
^ that 's &num people who responded and ordered report # &num . 
^ those &num people mail out &num , &num e-mails each for a total of &num , &num e-mails . 
^ the &num response to that is &num orders for report # &num . 
^ those &num people send &num , &num e-mails each for a total of &num million e-mails sent out . 
^ the &num response is &num , &num orders for report # &num . 
^ those &num , &num people send out &num , &num e-mails each for a total of &num , &num , &num ( &num million ) e-mails . 
^ the &num response to that is &num , &num orders for report # &num . 
^ that 's &num , &num orders &char $ &num each $ &num , &num 
^ your total income in this example is : 
^ &num . ... $ &num + &num . . ... $ &num + &num . . ... $ &num , &num + &num . . ... $ &num , &num + &num . . ... $ &num , &num . ... &name total $ &num , &num 
^ this example assumes only &num people ordered out of the &num , &num you mailed to . 
^ dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or &num percent or even &num percent of those people mailed &num , &num e-mails each or more ? 
^ there are over &num million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . 
^ instructions - start here !
