^ &name bank international &name &name island lagos-nigeria alternative mail exercise some patience and read through this detailed message 
^ i am &name &name &name account officer of &num of the &name in lagos . 
^ for reason , which will to light as you read on . 
^ i have a very urgent and confidential business proposition for you &name december 6th &num an oil consultant with the nigerian national corporation , mr. &name &name &name , from &name , made a numbered time /fixed for &num calendar months , valued us $ &num million in my branch . 
^ on maturity , we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . 
^ after a month we sent a reminder and finally , his contract employers , the &name , wrote to inform us that mr. &name &name &name died in an automobile accident while travelling to the eastern part of the country . 
^ that he died without making &char will while all attempts to trace his &name in &name and inform them about mr. . 
^ mustapha'sdeposit of us10million plus accrued interest were ruitless.further investigation revealed that mr. &name was actively opposed to the government of his country as a result of which he was driven into exile . 
^ being an oil expert , he subsequently obtained a job with &name , and settled in &name . 
^ thereafter , he walked into my office to make the aforementioned deposit of us $ 10million . 
^ he did not declare his &name in his application paperwork . 
^ when i asked , he informed me that he wished it so . 
^ in the conservative manner of our bank ( my employer ) , i did not turn down his wish but rather honored it especially given his high net worth . 
^ in reality no one knows the source of his money since apparently , the time frame of his employment with the &name does indeed preclude such a large amount of money . 
^ it is therefore presumed that he brought his money from &name , although this is open to speculation . 
^ the point however is that his employers are not aware of his money , therefore one can safely infer that no one will ever forward to claim this money . 
^ this fund , totaling &name , with accrue interest , is still siting in my bank dormant account portfolio . 
^ according to nigerian law , the money will automatically revert to the federal government treasury after &num years , especially if the account owner is a foreigner who hasbeen certified dead and there is no valid claim . 
^ i am thus looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to mr. &name . 
^ it is not necessary to be a blood relation , neither is it necessary to bear the same saw name with mr. &name &name is even not important for the stand in next of kin to from kuwait.already i have worked out modalities for achieving my aim of appointing a next of kin as well as transfer the money abroad for us to share . 
^ apparently no risk involved ! 
^ i will process the initial paperwork to obtain approval from the concern parastatal / department . 
^ if you therefore agree to be the inheritor / next of &name you should provide immediately with the following 
^ &num a bank account ( an account with &num credit balance is okay . 
^ &num the name and address of the bank , holder / beneficiary , your phone and fax number 
^ once i have the required information as above , i will initiate the processing of the transfer , and in about &num working days , the fund will be in your nominated bank account for us to share , in the ratio of : &num for me and &num for you . 
^ this transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problems . 
^ and i shall forward to you more clarification you need and you are free to ask questions . 
^ looking forward to your urgent reply your truly , 
^ &name &name &name . 
^ please note alternative mail
