^ &num day a teacher asked her students to list the names of the other students in the room on &num sheets of paper , leaving a space between each name . 
^ then she told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates and write it down . 
^ it took the remainder of the class period to finish their assignment , and as the students left the room , each one handed in the papers . 
^ that saturday , the teacher wrote down the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper , and listed what everyone else had said about that individual . 
^ on monday she gave each student his or her list . 
^ before long , the entire class was smiling . 
^ ' really ? ' she heard whispered . 
^ ' i never knew that i meant anything to anyone ! ' and , ' i did n't know others liked me so much . ' were most of the comments . 
^ no one ever mentioned those papers in class again . 
^ she never knew if they discussed them after class or with their parents , but it did n't matter . 
^ the exercise had accomplished its purpose . 
^ the students were happy with themselves and one another . 
^ that group of students moved on . 
^ several years later , &num of the students was killed in &name &name and his teacher attended the funeral of that special student . 
^ she had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin before . 
^ he looked so handsome , so mature . 
^ the church was packed with his friends . 
^ one by &num those who loved him took a last walk by the coffin . 
^ the teacher was the last one to bless the coffin . 
^ as she stood there , &num of the soldiers who acted as pallbearer came up to her . 
^ ' were you &name 's math teacher ? ' he asked . 
^ she nodded : ' yes . ' then he said : &name talked about you a lot . ' 
^ after the funeral , most of &name 's former classmates went together to a luncheon . 
^ &name 's mother and father were there , obviously waiting to speak with his teacher . 
^ ' we want to show you something , ' his father said , taking a wallet out of his pocket . 
^ ' they found this on &name when he was killed . 
^ we thought you might recognize it . ' 
^ opening the billfold , he carefully removed &num worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped , folded and refolded many times . 
^ the teacher knew without looking that the papers were the &num on which she had listed all the good things each of &name 's classmates had said about him . 
^ ' thank you so much for doing that , ' &name 's mother said . 
^ ' as you can see , &name treasured it . ' 
^ all of &name 's former classmates started to gather around . 
^ &name smiled rather sheepishly and said , ' i still have my list . 
^ it 's in the top drawer of my desk at home . ' 
^ &name 's wife said , ' &name asked me to put his in our wedding album . ' 
^ ' i have mine too , ' &name said . 
^ ' it 's in my diary . ' 
^ then &name , another classmate , reached into her pocketbook , took out her wallet and showed her worn and frazzled list to the group . 
^ ' i carry this with me at all times , ' &name said and without batting an eyelash , she continued : ' i think we all saved our lists . ' 
^ that 's when the teacher finally sat down and cried . 
^ she cried for &name and for all his friends who would never see him again . 
^ the density of people in society is so thick that we forget that life will end &num day . 
^ and we do n't know when that &num day will be . 
^ so please , tell the people you love and care for , that they are special and important . 
^ tell them , before it is too late . 
^ and &num &name to accomplish this is : forward this message on . 
^ if you do not send it , you will have , once again passed up the wonderful opportunity to do something nice and beautiful . 
^ if you 've received this , it is because someone cares for you and it means there is probably at least someone for whom you care . 
^ if you 're ' too busy ' to take those few minutes right now to forward this message on , would this be the very first time you did n't do that little thing that would make a difference in your relationships ? 
^ the more people that you send this to , the better you 'll be at reaching out to those you care about . 
^ remember , you reap what you sow . 
^ what you put into the lives of others comes back into your own . 
^ may your day be blessed and as special as you are
