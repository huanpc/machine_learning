^ the transaction is very much free from all sort of risk hence the business was carefully planned before it was executed and we the n.n.r.c. officals involved in the deal have &name many years in services to our ministry . 
^ we have been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of &name , this is a life time opportunity we cannot afford to miss .
