^ how to sell your news to reporters by &name &name &name ( &char ) &num 
^ if you want create a &name campaign that is effective and consistent , you must learn to market your story to the news media . 
^ you must learn to treat reporters as the customers who will either buy or reject your product : raw news . 
^ you should apply the techniques of &name &name , which is the practice of using the news media to attract customers and clients to your enterprise . 
^ any effective campaign of &name &name is grounded in &num fundamental ideas : 
^ &char ) the reporter is the consumer . 
^ &char ) the story is the product that must be tailored for and sold to that consumer . 
^ &char ) reporters will buy your story for their reasons , not yours . 
^ the reporter is the consumer 
^ today 's &name specialists often forget this basic principle . 
^ the bad &num - the &num that reporters ridicule as &name ' flacks ' - never learn it . 
^ to some of these folks , the reader or the viewer is their primary consumer . 
^ others consider their client or their &name to be the consumer of their work . 
^ wrong . 
^ the &name &name knows : when it comes to getting your story into the media , you must look upon the reporter as your consumer . 
^ without the reporter , nothing happens . 
^ there is no story for your target audience to view or to read . 
^ there is nothing for your &name to show his directors . 
^ there is nothing for your sales team to hand out to prospects . 
^ without the reporter , all you have is a story idea . 
^ the reporter is the consumer . 
^ the reporter is the customer . 
^ and you must act accordingly . 
^ the story is the product 
^ it is not enough that you want to sell something . 
^ countless enterprises have lost money trying to sell a product they wanted to sell and no one wanted to buy . 
^ no matter what you produce , you must find a market that wants to purchase your product . 
^ the same holds true when placing your story in the news media . 
^ the &name &name knows that the story is the product . 
^ the story must be tailored for the consumer , who is the reporter . 
^ then it must be sold to that reporter . 
^ is your site ranked in the &name &num , &num for your keywords ? 
^ find out here - then do something about it ! 
^ this is where &name flacks lose their direction . 
^ they look upon media relations as mass production . 
^ they want to build an assembly line . 
^ they want to crank out &num press release after another , send out a blast fax , and read their story in the newspapers the next day . 
^ by using these 'spray and pray ' techniques , a company may well generate media coverage . 
^ but that coverage is likely to be ineffective . 
^ the key messages will be distorted . 
^ the story will go to the wrong audiences . 
^ the company will receive no return on its investment other than some newspaper clippings and perhaps some videotape . 
^ the &name &name knows : the best news stories are earned one by &num . 
^ the assembly-line approach rarely works well in media relations . 
^ reporters do not like to buy ' off the rack . ' each wants a story of his own . 
^ each demands a custom fit . 
^ so it becomes the &name &name 's job to take stock of a reporter 's needs and wants . 
^ we must tailor the story to fit that reporter . 
^ then we must take that product and sell it to the reporter . 
^ we must convince the reporter that our story solves the reporter 's problems . 
^ we must keep in mind during every step of developing the campaign : the reporter is the consumer and the story is the product . 
^ reporters buy for their reasons , not ours 
^ it is not unusual to spend hours designing a story for a specific reporter , only to have the reporter reject the idea . 
^ this can become incredibly frustrating . 
^ this is &num reason why so many flacks resort to assembly-line , blast-fax methods . 
^ ' why should i bother ? ' they say . 
^ ' why not just send out a thousand press releases and hope someone somewhere picks up the story ? ' 
^ but &name rainmakers understand and accept the challenge of executing an effective campaign . 
^ they know that , when it comes to convincing a reporter to buy any particular story , failure is far more likely than success . 
^ as with any sales prospect , a reporter is more apt to say no than yes , even when you have tailored the story especially for that reporter . 
^ why ? 
^ who knows ? 
^ maybe the reporter is working on a seven-part investigative series and does n't have time . 
^ maybe the reporter is being moved to another news beat . 
^ maybe the reporter is coming down with the flu . 
^ maybe the reporter is going on vacation . 
^ maybe the reporter is just a jerk . 
^ who knows ? 
^ who cares ? 
^ when the reporter says no , move on . 
^ do n't argue . 
^ do n't rage . 
^ do n't resort to spray and pray . 
^ advance to the next proposal with the next reporter . 
^ reporters will buy for their reasons , not ours . 
^ keep telling yourself this and you will have a much better chance of holding your temper , maintaining your sanity and placing more stories in the news media .
