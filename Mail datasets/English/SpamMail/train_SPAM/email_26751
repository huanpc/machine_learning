^ from : &name . 
^ &name &name auditing and accounting unit . 
^ foreign operations department . 
^ &name &name pour le commerce et l' industrie , &name &name . 
^ dear friend , 
^ i am &name . 
^ &name &name , the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of &name &name pour le commerce et l' industrie &name in &name &name with due respect and regard . 
^ i have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction . 
^ during our investigation and auditing in this bank , my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on november 1st &num in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with this bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this development . 
^ although personally , i keep this information secret within myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be profitable and successful during the time of execution . 
^ the said amount was ( &name &char $ &name united states dollars ) as it may interest you to know , i got your impressive information through my good friends who works with chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here in &name &name . 
^ it is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to champion a business of such magnitude without anyproblem . 
^ meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased , get the required approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this greatbusiness opportunity . 
^ in fact i could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant ( &char banker ) , we are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of transfer because i work in this bank . 
^ this is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the &name and also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from to yourown designation bank account . 
^ i will not fail to inform you that this transaction is &num risk free . 
^ on smooth conclusion of this transaction , you will be entitled to &num of the total sum as gratification , while &num will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills , while &num will be for me and my partners . 
^ please , you have been adviced to keep ' top secret ' as we are still in service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you . 
^ i will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your account . 
^ and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and further investment , either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in. all other necessary vital information will be sent to you when i hear from you . 
^ i suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this deal . 
^ i look forward to pick your call asap . 
^ yours faithfully , 
^ &name . 
^ &name &name .
