^ does this headline look familiar ? 
^ of course it does . 
^ you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &name ) . 
^ and reported elsewhere in the world . 
^ his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . 
^ nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . 
^ &name bills , &num , &num and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . 
^ 'my first thought was that he had robbed a bank ' , says the 41-year-old woman , ' there was over $ &num , &num dollars in that bag -- that 's more than my husband earns in a year ' . 
^ the woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . 
^ he came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . 
^ little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . 
^ as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e-mail , a type of ' report ' to e-mail addresses that he obtained off the everyday after school for the past &num months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . 
^ ' i just got the e-mail &num day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out ' , says the clever 15-year-old . 
^ the e-mail letter listed &num addresses and contained instructions to send &num $ &num dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . 
^ the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in &name bills within &num weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . 
^ ' &num get junk e-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work ' , the boy continues . 
^ within the first few days of sending out the e-mail , the &name office &name that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines , but envelopes containing $ &num bills . 
^ ' about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &num magazine and about &num envelops stuffed in it . 
^ there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . 
^ i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) ' . 
^ he goes on , ' i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . 
^ i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all ' . 
^ over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e-mail .' the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework ' &name had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &num bills for &num , &num and hundreds . 
^ ' &website reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called ' chain-letter ' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &name fact , it was completely legal according to &name &name and &name &name , &name &num , section &num and &num , or title &num , section &num in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , &name &num , sections &num and &num , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . 
^ every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , ' please send me report number &name ' .this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &char report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . 
^ [ this is the end of the media release .

^ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only &num , &num e-mails each . 
^ let 's also assume 
^ that the mailing receives only a &num ( &num / &num of &num ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &num ) . 
^ also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &num , &num each ) . 
^ continuing with this example , you send out only &num , &name e-mails . 
^ with a &num response , that is only &num orders for report # &num . 
^ those &num people responded by sending out &num , &num e-mail each for a total of &num , &num . 
^ out of those &num , &num e-mails only &num responded with orders . 
^ that's0 people responded and ordered report # &num . 
^ those &num people mail out &num , &num e-mails each for a total of &num , &num e-mails . 
^ the &num response to that is &num orders for report # &num . 
^ those &num people send &num , &num e-mail each for a total of &num million e-mail sent out . 
^ the &num response is &num , &num orders for report # &num . 
^ those &num , &num people send out &num , &num e-mails each for a total of &num , &num , &num ( &num million ) e-mails . 
^ the &num response to that is &num , &num orders for report # &num . 
^ that 's &num , &num orders times $ &num each ( half a million dollars ) . 
^ your total income in this example is : &num ... $ &num + &num . . ... $ &num + &num . . ... $ &num , &num + &num . . ... $ &num , &num + &num . ... $ &num , &num . ... grand total $ &num , &name 
^ numbers do not lie 
^ get a pencil &amp; paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! 
^ ( i did it was $ &num , &num in &num months ) 
^ remember , this is assuming only &num people ordering out of &num , &num you mailed to . 
^ dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &num 4th of those people mailed &num , &num e-mails each or more ? 
^ there are &num million people on the worldwide and counting , with thousands of more coming on line every day . 
^ believe me , there is n't any better way to make money !
