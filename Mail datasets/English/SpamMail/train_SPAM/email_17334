^ as consumers , we always try to find the best price or deal . 
^ the same pertains to acquiring a credit card . 
^ no use holding onto a credit card with a higher interest rate when we can bounce around from card to card in hopes of slashing interest rates , right ? 
^ well , not always . 
^ it may not always pay to jump from &num credit card to another , transferring balances in order to save money . 
^ the reason is because there may be some factors that you either may overlook ( such as in the fine print ) or you were not aware of . 
^ there are some advantages of switching cards , but you just need to be careful . 
^ before you sign up for that new , low introductory credit card , consider these pros and cons of switching credit cards : &name 
^ stability - if you plan on switching credit cards , try to keep it to a minimum . 
^ credit lenders look for stability in a consumer 's history , so avoid switching cards often . 
^ if you switch credit cards only once a year , you are not viewed as risky to lenders . 
^ calendar - when you receive a new credit card , find out when the low rate ends and mark it on your calendar . 
^ once the offer is over , make sure the balance is paid off . 
^ at that time , then consider switching credit cards . 
^ same amount - if you are in a habit of paying the same amount every month , continue to do so even if your interest rates drop . 
^ your minimum payments go down when your interest rates drop , but continue to pay the same amount as you were prior to the rate reduction . 
^ you will pay off your balance much quicker and save more in interest . 
^ &name 
^ hidden fees - some credit cards may require you to pay a balance transfer fee , so make sure you read the small print . 
^ these types of hidden fees can wind up costing you money . 
^ different rates - many credit card issuers have different rates for purchases and balance transfers , so be careful . 
^ &num rate may be higher than the other . 
^ increase in rates - you can easily forget when a card issuer 's initial low interest rate ends . 
^ if you forget or fail to pay off the card 's balance before the low rate ends , you could end up paying a very high amount in interest . 
^ let us know your opinion on the subject . 
^ we 'd love to hear what you have to say about it !

^ preparing for the future 
^ there are certain things in life that should be top priority : family , health , and future planning . 
^ as we grow older , future planning becomes a bigger part of our thinking . 
^ we set up retirement funds , plan for our children 's education , and take care of insurance . 
^ when it comes to taking care of your possessions , an plan can accommodate your needs . 
^ there are certain important factors that go into planning , namely a will , a living will , assignment of power of attorney , and medical power of attorney . 
^ we define what they are to help you better understand the importance of preparing for the future . 
^ living will - a living will is a written document that a person 's wishes regarding life-support or other medical treatment in certain circumstances . 
^ the signer requests not to be kept alive by medical life-support systems in the event of a terminal illness . 
^ it is suggested to be as specific as possible in your living will while avoiding being too general . 
^ your instructions should clearly cover the treatment decisions that must be made and you should specify the kind of treatment that you do not want . 
^ &name - a will is a legal declaration of how a person wishes to have his or her possessions disposed of after death . 
^ the best way to ensure that your funds , property and personal possessions will be distributed according to your wishes after you die is to prepare a will . 
^ &char will designates the transfer of your property and assets after you die . 
^ &name can be written by a person over the age of &num who is mentally capable . 
^ individual may impose additional requirements . 
^ &name of attorney - a legal document that enables an individual to designate another person , called the attorney in fact , to act on his / her behalf as long as the individual does not become disabled or incapacitated . 
^ medical power of attorney - a legal document that enables you to appoint a trusted person to make decisions about your medical care if you cannot make those decisions yourself because you are unconscious , groggy from medications , or delusional . 
^ the assigned individual can act to make medical decisions on your behalf . 
^ take the time to plan ahead , it 's important to both your family and your finances .

^ ways to better manage your money 
^ have you ever met a person who does n't owe somebody something ? 
^ we all have expenses ; it 's just a part of life . 
^ granted , some of us have more expenses and debt than others , but we all have to budget our money in order to live as comfortably as possible . 
^ if you are in debt and are struggling to get your head above water , you may need to step things up a bit and prioritize , even if that means taking drastic measures . 
^ no , we 're not talking about robbing a bank ; we 're talking about tightening the belt a bit more and sucking it up for a while . 
^ that means anything from putting away the credit cards to setting a strict budget . 
^ it is n't always an easy thing to do and it does take some dedication and work , but there are steps that you can take in order to better manage your budget and your money . 
^ what do you owe ? 
^ - the first thing you need to do is calculate the total amount you owe to your creditors . 
^ once this is done , you then can determine the next steps needed to budget your money . 
^ organize - a good way to help you get your bills in order is by organizing them . 
^ by doing so , you will know which creditors need to be paid first . 
^ make credit cards with the highest interest rate your top priority . 
^ also , take into account any late fees you may incur . 
^ consolidate - consider transferring your balances to &num creditor . 
^ if you have a creditor with a low interest rate , you may consider transferring all of your other outstanding debt to it . 
^ be careful , as some creditors offer low interest rates for only a limited time , offering them as promotional introductory rates . 
^ &name em up - that 's right , we 're talking about your credit cards . 
^ just do n't use them . 
^ put them away . 
^ &name them up . 
^ whatever you have to do to not use them , do so . 
^ they can get you into financial trouble in a very short period of time , and the better your credit is , the more credit card offers are made by lenders . 
^ use a debit card or pay the old fashioned way with cash . 
^ necessities - purchase only the necessities and lower your spending on unimportant items while only spending on the critical things . 
^ impulse - stop buying spur-of-the-moment , impulse buying items that you can live without . 
^ these suggestions should help you get your budget in order and help you become a bit more organized . 
^ we hope these tips help ! 
^ send us your feedback . 
^ we 'd love to hear from you !
