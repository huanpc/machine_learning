^ although i have several yeas of experience with &name in its several variants i am an absolute newbie to the world of &name . 
^ so to get started i am looking for &num things : 
^ &num a tutorial that will walk me through a typical project . 
^ &num a feature list that will allow me to see what &name has as compared to the other products available . 
^ &num a pdf version of the manual . 
^ &name it is described as being " like quark or &name " but since these products are quite different that is not a sufficient description . 
^ my first impression is that it is closer to the capabiities of quark . 
^ &name &name &name &name and &name
