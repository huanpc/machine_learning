^ if you could confirm this as soon as you 're able i 'd appreciate it - i 'll get the keys to you before we go on holiday and ask you to look after the ringing if that 's ok - all i have to do now is find &num others ! 
^ do n't be suprised if you end up with a band of " crumblies " as most younger types will be at work . 
^ the service starts at 2pm but it 's just ringing afterwards as usual . 
^ the couple getting married are &name &name and &name &name ( who took charge of the christmas choir last year if you remember ) and she reckons the service will be at least &num mins ( extra singing i expect ) ! 
^ you think friday is unusual ? 
^ we 've got one to ring for on monday 23rd december too ! ! 
^ i 've deleted your &name e-mail address from my address book by the way .
