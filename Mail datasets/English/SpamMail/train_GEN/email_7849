^ from : " &name " ( &email ) to : " &name &name " ( &email ) subject : re : &name : &name , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &num 
^ &name &name i think this is everything &name 's said to me about christmas presents , so have a look at this lot ... 
^ oh , for mam 's &name . 
^ i remember her saying ages ago that she loved &name expectations ( the new one with gwyneth) . 
^ i know she does n't like &name but she said she loved &name &name in it . 
^ i 've never been able to find it in &name , just the old one , and obviously it 's no use buying it here , but maybe you could have a scan around you . 
^ either that or &name &name and the last &name . 
^ &name and &name in the same film . 
^ &name , heaven . 
^ and mam likes them as well , obviously . 
^ there 's heaps of stuff i want for &name but it 's all here . 
^ but i spose i could get it then get money or whatever . 
^ i was just going to get presents for everyone here cuz i 've seen so much cool stuff but we could get bits on both sides of the watter . 
^ &name said before i left she wanted a dodgers cap but i do n't know if she still does . 
^ i 'll ask . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal>

</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ so far i have a photo of &name looking &char sexy pour ma &name , a western tshirt for dad and a print for ewan . 
^ i was also thinking of getting &name the &num soundtracks for &name and confused cuz he seems to be into his &num music just now . 
^ i can get them cheap through &name 's &name club which would be good . 
^ do you want a voodoo &name kit ? 
^ i found &num last week and i 'm dying to give it to someone but i do n't know who 'd want it . 
^ must think . 
^ tell me what you think . 
^ so that 's what 's going on with christmas presents so far . 
^ i have n't really looked for &name expectations yet , but i will do as soon as i remember . 
^ in fact i 'll do it now ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ why doesnt &name have the voodoo kit herself ? 
^ it seems she would have a use for it by what she says bout her hosts ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ okay i can get &name expectations from amazon for less than a tenner , i think . 
^ if this is good enough should i just get that ? 
^ also , how much is the &name &name set you 're looking at ? 
^ &name i can get that too if it 's cheaper there ... ? 
^ let me know . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ if you think thats fine you can get it . 
^ &name no ideas for mam anyway.youre not going to find it much cheaper if any than that . 
^ are you coming up at the end of november ? 
^ if you are we can sort out any loose ends up here together . 
^ the &name &name cd is &num in &name but i havent looked anywhere else . 
^ dont know about the &name dvd cause its not out til the 26th nov. &name expensive though . 
^ i thought that with student discounts though it might be possible .
