^ hi &name 
^ the reason you got the error message you did is because you ca n't use &name to send mail outside &name , only receive e-mail . 
^ there is however a simple procedure to get it working from your btopenworld connection . 
^ &num in &name &name ( and i assume the same is true of &name ) you can select accounts from the tools menu . 
^ do so . 
^ &num . 
^ under the 'mail " &name , there will be &num or more e-mail accounts listed , one of which is your &name ( &name ) one . 
^ select it and then click the properties button . 
^ &website " ( it may be under a section entitled 'servers " ) . 
^ replace this text with " &website " &num . 
^ click ok to get out of properties and ok to get out of the accounts . 
^ send a test e-mail to yourself to check it now works . 
^ &website 
^ regards
