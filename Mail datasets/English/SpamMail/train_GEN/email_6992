^ hi everyone ! 
^ hope you 're all well and enjoying the weekend &smiley sorry i 've left this a bit late , but if you happen to check your emails before the prayer meeting today and have anything specific you 'd like us to pray for ( especially if you ca n't make it to the meeting yourself ) , then do let me know and i 'll make a note of it and make sure we pray about it &smiley do n't forget to mention any answers to prayer and other stuff to thank &name for ! 
^ thanks again for all your hard work- it has n't been in vain , as we have a great &name who 's " able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine , according to the power at work within us- to him be the glory in the church and in &name &name , throughout all generations , for ever and ever , &name " ! 
^ hope to see many of you later , love &name 
^ ps does anyone who 's had contact with &name &name know whether there 's anything he 'd especially appreciate prayer for- apart from the obvious ?
