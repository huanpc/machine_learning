^ ello everybody . 
^ dont remembre when we last sent everybody an email , so you may hear some things that you already know or we may miss out some stuff that we did that was really fun ( wonder which you would prefer ? ) anyway , rotorua rings a bell , so we 'll start there . 
^ did the tongariro crossing on the north island of &name , and a very funny thing happened . 
^ we met &name . 
^ this was obviously quite a surprise . 
^ she told us some nice stories about home , like the one about tunce throwing up all over will turtles room and waking up next to pippa . 
^ why are you feigning ignorance tuncey my boy ? 
^ we all know whats been going on . 
^ anyway , that made us laugh , and the walk was really good - past the bigf volcanoe that they use for mount doom in the films . 
^ after that we caught a lift with an australian guy down to &name . 
^ our driver had many interesting things to say about new &name , all along the lines of how much better it was when he came as a youth ( yes , he was definitely thinning on top) . 
^ in &name we got to see the lord of the ring &char exhibit at the te papa museum , which was nice since they were supposed to close it about &num months before we arrived , then they extended it to &num days before we arrived , but we went along anyway and it was still open . 
^ yay . 
^ it was very cool , with costumes and props from the films etc. managed to pull a switch with the &num ring , so now i have total control over the whole world . 
^ muhahahaha . 
^ caught the ferry over to &name next ( does this sound a bit like ingrids email anyone ? 
^ - we were there first anyway so nnnneeerrrr ) the malbrough sounds were indeed nice . 
^ again caught a lift to the next stop - &name this time , in the back of a van of a strange german girl called chocolate . 
^ in the supposedly sunniest city in &name it pissed it down . 
^ this made us sad , but the woman in mcdonalds was happy because her cows could now eat nice grass . 
^ that makes me happy because i am going to eat her cows . 
^ next went to &name glacier , via the pancake rocks which are totally inedible which is a bit of a &name if you ask me . 
^ at fox we climbed the glacier , our guide was very handy with an ice pick carving steps out whenever it got too treacherous . 
^ also went to the glowworm dell , which is not overly exciting , although it was fun watching other tourists shining their torches at them and wondering why they couldnt see them . 
^ really . 
^ next went to wanaka , where we tried to climb a mountain but the farmer had chosen that day to air-spray the land , so we had to settle for a different walk . 
^ whilst hitching back , this scottish guy told us that he had just done a flight over the mountains to the &name sounds - these are fjords for the uninitiated - and that it was awesome . 
^ we wanted to go to the sounds too , and as we were feeling lazy a flight sounded like a good idea . 
^ it was super sweet - flying past mt aspiring and a number of lord of the rings locations beginning with &char or &char . 
^ landed at &name and did a cruise on the sounds which was also nice . 
^ next went to queenstown , where we did the luuuuuge . 
^ this was very cool , and we didnt even need lessons before we started ( dr evil was obviously crap ) they also have the highest bungy in &name there , which is scary but fun . 
^ so fun infact that &name has decided to do a bungy somewhere ! ! 
^ after there we went to the east coast and oamaru , where we saw &name coming onto the beach after a hard day fishing . 
^ they were cute . 
^ everybody say aaaahhhhh . 
^ not much else to do there , except visit a cheese factory . 
^ our hopes were high , but instead of the expected tour , we were allowed to look in through a window at a room full of cheese . 
^ oooooooooooooooo . 
^ did eat some cheese though , which almost makes up for it , and an american we were with interrogated the poor cheese-selling woman so much i thought she was going to cry . 
^ in the end she had to fetch a cheese man from out back to answer his questions . 
^ we now know lots more about cheese manufacture than is probably healthy . 
^ final port of call in &name was christchurch . 
^ whatever people say about punting in the river is all lies . 
^ the guy told us it was too fast for us to go it alone , and we would have to take a &name punt tour . 
^ even the fact that we were hardened cam-punters held no sway with him . 
^ to prove a point , the next day we went rafting on a much faster river , which was supercool - didnt see much &name on the &name . 
^ what a pussy . 
^ spent some time generally bumming around christchirch before relocating to &name , which is where we are now . 
^ went to &name yesterday which was very cool . 
^ found one of those red and yellow lifeguard hats ( like in home and away ) on the beach so took it for a souvenir . 
^ tried it on and the women came flocking . 
^ no really . 
^ should become a lifeguard - sounds like a good career path . 
^ wonder what the pensions like ? 
^ tomorrow we are off to the opera house to be all cultured . 
^ &name would like everyonw to know that redcar was pivotal in the construction of the &name harbour bridge , which ew went on . 
^ anyway , thats probably enough for now . 
^ &name - &name is indeed chidos and you will no doubt love it . 
^ congratulations again to anyone who has a job . 
^ chins up for the coming exams . 
^ nobody is allowed to use &name patented " pit of despair " technique to ace them . 
^ see everybody soon . 
^ loads of love and kisses 
^ &name and &name 
^ also , the fact that &name is still alive fills me with hope that we too may survive &name and its killer diseases / vader infestation
