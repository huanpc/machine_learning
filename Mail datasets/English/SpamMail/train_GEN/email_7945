^ &name , le weekend . 
^ &name . 
^ except for studying , but nice . 
^ did n't get my first pay cheque yesterday when i thought i would . 
^ my social insurance no. was n't in on time . 
^ bugger . 
^ but i get &num cheques next week so spose it 's ok . 
^ i did n't finish work til about 6pm last night . 
^ they were having a little presentation thing cuz some guy who died recently donated all his olympic books ( about &num of them apparently ) to the centre so his wife and daughter were there on his behalf . 
^ some of the books are from like the " &num olympics - it 's mad . 
^ but it was nice enough . 
^ one of the guys who works at the centre ( he 's actually retired but he 's there all teh time ) , he 's originally from &name so he has the coolest accent . 
^ but anyway , i was talking to him and i told him i was from near &name . 
^ he 's like " oh , i 've been to &name . 
^ i support them in the scottish soccer league' . 
^ so i 'm like " hey so do &char " and showed him my &name top i was wearing . 
^ it 's getting ridiculous now.everywhere you go there 's somebody with " the connection' . 
^ at one point there were &num of us standing round the bar and not one of us was canadian : him and his wife , and &num girls i work with , one from &name and the other with a russian family i think . 
^ it was too weird . 
^ there was also an english guy but i do n't think he was impressed with me cuz i made a little comment about the emglish and he stopped coming up to the bar after that . 
^ oh well , no loss . 
^ ok , so &name 's present . 
^ you 'll sort that out from your end ? 
^ i 'll &name the &name book since there 's something she actually wants and i ca n't afford to be too generous . 
^ actually , i ca n't to be generous full stop . 
^ the cds for &name were a special deal , something like $ &num each so they were n't dear . 
^ but if need be i would easily keep them cuz that film 's magic . 
^ the bookends sound nice , especially for the living room . 
^ would they go ? 
^ there 's soooo much stuff i want but i 'm trying to restrain myself . 
^ but &num priority , &name park by feeder . 
^ i had a copy but it 's totally minced . 
^ i can play about &num song all the way through without it jumping . 
^ and there 's also a book , " now you must &name " by &name &name . 
^ i read it for my &name and i always meant to get my own copy . 
^ but i do n't know how long it would take to come . 
^ i have the &name if you need it . 
^ ok , have to go . 
^ &char & i have actually gone out so i have to make the most of a free house . 
^ &name . 
^ &name luv , &name xx
