^ hi guys &name you 've had good evenings ! 
^ thanks very much for all the prayer info &name - i gave that out to all the exec tonight as well , and have invited them all for thursday - hope that 's ok ! 
^ we discussed the practical points for saturday . 
^ i have a couple of suggestions and a couple of questions. . 
^ &num ) looking back over ticket selling we are concerned that too many blocks have been in place discouraging people from buying , such as saying strongly that people should n't buy a ticket unless bringing a friend , and also not allowing people to take tickets and pay later ( this certainly prevented quite a few from buying tickets at &name / &name ) . 
^ at this late stage we would suggest that for the sake of filling the venue , even if it does create more admin , you provide tickets , take people 's names , and allow them to pay later . 
^ &num ) on that front , could you provide an update on how sales are going ? 
^ &num ) saturday : please let me know where and when you would like &name to be so that i can liaise with him and meet him and bring him to the right places at the right time ! 
^ if you could do this as soon as possible that would be great , as he wants to know . 
^ i 'll tell him to wear a suit and will tell him that his wife can have a free ticket . 
^ &name this is all ok . 
^ thanks very much for dealing with all of my e-mails recently ... i realise i 'm filling your inboxes daily ! 
^ much love and prayers , &name
