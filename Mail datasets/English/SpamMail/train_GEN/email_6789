^ i finished my project at midnight ! 
^ &name ! 
^ excellent &smiley 
^ i gave up and let &name have &name " comments and she 's working on it . 
^ she 's just come in with what she 's done and it 's attached . 
^ the bits in pink and balck in boldare &name " commets which we do n't know what to do with . 
^ help ! 
^ after looking at your last e-mail and this one , i 'll have to look a little closer at this - i 'll do that this evening & e-mail you later . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ thanks for what you 've done in the other email . 
^ i gave it to &name although i have n't read the email myself yet ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i have nothing from &name still . 
^ sorry , that 's my fault . 
^ &name gave his stuff to me yesterday , but after postering &name ( hence why you got posters from me in your pigeon hole for &name since i was practically going past there ) i felt rather tired & forgot about all the things that i intended to do ... sorry ! 
^ i 've attached both the photo and biography . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i see no biog . 
^ am &char being thick ? ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ hope i 've worked out the difference between &name and &name now ! 
^ i did n't have &name 's photo before i 'm pretty sure . 
^ &name is the one in the bow tie , &name has a casual top on . 
^ as i ca n't check back on the contents of attachments of sent e-mails , i ca n't verify whether i sent you &name 's photo before , so i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name good that 's ok then &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ anyway , would it be at all possible for me to meet up with you tomorrow to discuss the last little bits of it ? 
^ i just need a second opinion now . 
^ i have lectures &num and &num : &num . 
^ do you want me to come to you or to come here ? 
^ &name , i 'm happy to meet up . 
^ where 's your &num lecture ? 
^ i 'm quite happy to come to &name , unless this lecture is somewhere like the &name &name site in which case it 'd make more sense if you came to me . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i have all my lectures here and will do forever ! 
^ would it be ok if you came over at about 4pm or just before ? 
</text_normal>

^ &name i 've got the front cover from dad . 
^ he insists on calling it a poster ! ! 
^ i have thanks , it arrived late this afternoon , but i need to print it off to decide whether it is ok or not ( since this was where the problem lay before ) . 
^ it looks like it 'll be fine , but i really ca n't tell properly until i 've printed it out ( and my printer is not working so i need to set up the network printers on my computer & print to the college &num ... oh well , more work ! ) . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ sorry about that ! 
^ i do n't mean to pass all my work onto you ! ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ anyway , thanks for your support . 
^ thank you for your work , especially as you have so many other things on to do . 
^ it 'll all be over in a few days time ! 
</text_embedded>
