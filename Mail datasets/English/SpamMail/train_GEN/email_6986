^ guys i 'll ask &name to use the prayer points you sent for &name - if you do have someone you can send to &name who can help out by introducing them that would be great , if not , no worries . 
^ thanks- should be no problem to have someone at &name i 'll be there myself if i can &smiley 
^ it seems silly , in my opinion , to be running a prayer meeting at 4pm in &name when &name is at &name ... ca n't people come to that , and we pray with &name at some later point before &num ?

^ agreed- that 's why i sent that email !

^ &name will finish at &name , sorry for getting it wrong ! 
^ so , there are a couple of options : &num ) i can meet &name and bring him to &name for &num , him having eaten dinner earlier , and we can pray in a suitable room for a while and then show him around etc at or after 7.15pm . 
^ &num ) i can bring &name to the rehearsal at &num for him to find out what 's what etc. he can then come to &name and out for some food with me , before arriving at &name &name 's at around &num for &num mins or so of prayer before we start 
^ why do n't you just see what time &name would like to arrive ? 
^ if he 'd like to hear some of the rehearsal , i 'd suggest he gets to the chapel some time between &num , which is when we 're having the final rehearsal . 
^ &num thing to remember is that from 7.15ish onwards , after people have left evensong , &name and the stewards will be setting up the chapel- with help from anyone else if needed . 
^ then the audience will start arriving from &num , if not before . 
^ i think by that stage , we 'll want to be settled and not rushing around too much- and of course , those of us performing will need to get ready . 
^ so perhaps it would be good to meet and pray in &name 's at &num let me know if that would work for you and &name , and i 'll find someone willing to let us use their room . 
^ this does have the drawback that &name wo n't be able to join us , but to me it seems like the best option ... i 'll let you get back to me on this after contacting &name . 
^ hope that 's all ok , love &name
