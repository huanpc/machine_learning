^ hi all we usually use a company called &name ( &website on &name &name &name ) as we have an account with them , and you can e-mail files to them and they 'll print them . 
^ the quality is also very good - better than standard photocopying at a cheap price ( we have a discount deal with them because we photocopy so much stuff ) i did n't realise that you were not aware of this so i assumed that you would be using them . 
^ you can take files to them on disk as well , and they 'll photocopy while you wait . 
^ they can also fold / staple / cut as necessary . 
^ they are not open on saturdays unfortunately , but will open until &name on friday i suggest that you use them for the rest , and for the whole lot if you feel the quality of what you have done is too poor and want to do it again . 
^ &name this all makes sense , &name

^ for your prayers ... ( &name do n't panic ! 
^ i just thought i should let you know so you can pray too ! ) i thought the rehearsal went really well tonight , do n't you think , &name ? 
^ &char found it really exciting to actually hear it all coming together &smiley do pray too that the musicians will be thinking about the cross already- &name 's obviously been referring to what each section is actually about , during the rehearsal , and of course it would be really great if this has already got them thinking , or at least ready to listen on saturday ! 
^ thanks again everyone for all your hard work &smiley love &name 
^ dear &name and &name , 
^ i went to &name this afternoon to print programmes with the help of &name &name . 
^ this was sucessful ( if very poor quality ) until the copyprinter broke . 
^ hopefully it will be fixed by tomorrow . 
^ so far &num sheets ( of &num ) are fully printed . 
^ a further &num are printed on &num side only ( including outside page see below ) . 
^ if the copyprinter is fixed by tomorrow morning then i should be able to finish the rest off then . 
^ if not then ummmmmmmmm . 
^ well , ummmmmm something . 
^ i 'm not sure exactly what i will do but i guess i will be using some photocopiers either at &name or mail boxes etc. 
^ &name : i was unable to sucessfully print out a copy of the front / back pages using college computers as i do n't have the correct fonts . 
^ if you could print out a copy of just these pages and put them in your pigeonhole at &name then i could collect it tomorrow morning on my way to &name or &name or somewhere . 
^ when you print it out it might be a good idea to increase the size of the &name bit on the back page as at the moment there is a lot of white space in the margins . 
^ hopefully everything will go fine tomorrow , if not &name is open on saturday so we can use that as a backup plan . 
^ do we have a plan on how we are going to get these things folded / stapled ?
