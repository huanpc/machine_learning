^ &name all ! 
^ &name new year ! 
^ i hope you had an enjoyable and restful christmas . 
^ many thanks for all your hard work with the chapel last term , it really is very much appreciated ! 
^ i have prepared a blank chapel clerking rota for this term , which i have placed in my pigeonhole ( the chapel looks rather out of bounds at the moment with the heating work which is going on ! ) . 
^ it would be great if you could have a look at this when you are passing , and sign down if you have a preference as to which services you would like to clerk for . 
^ if everyone signs down for about &num of each type of service to begin with , this should more or less cover all of them . 
^ again , with a bit of luck , this will mean less service-swapping later on in term ! 
^ also - what better way to celebrate the start of a new term and year than a chapel clerks " formal hall ? 
^ if you can come along on sunday evening , then book in at the &name machine . 
^ thanks again ! 
^ see you soon ,
