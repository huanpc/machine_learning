^ i do n't think we ( the box people ) need any of this information . 
^ as long as you ( the &name people ) store predicate and expression strings with identifiers as : &num : &char : &num : &num : we wo n't be needing tuple descriptors .

^ couple issues here : 
^ for the table typefield , we 'd like to remove the attribute " offset " and add an attribute 'size " of type int , since the offset may be inferred from the size . 
</text_embedded>

^ how so ? 
^ if the attribute is the third one appearing in the tuple , how could we use its size to determine its offset ? 
^ we 'd need the sizes of the previous attributes also , no ? 
</text_embedded>

^ we &name guys do not mind having the offset column in the table . 
^ however , assume that you are creating a &name as in your spec . 
^ then , i guess you would visit the compositetype table first and then , scan all the records in the typefield table such that &name &name . 
^ while doing so , i think you can accumulatively compute the correct offsets for the attirbutes and reflect those in the &name . 
^ conclusively , if you from time to time need to access the typefield table for individual attributes regardless of tupledescriptors you constructed , i guess we definitely need to have the offset field in the table . 
^ but , if tupledescriptors are good enough , i am doubtful if we still need the offset column in the table . 
^ please let me know what you think . 
^ thanks ,
