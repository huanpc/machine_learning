" [  um ] they deliberately ignore this fact , that by the word of  ame heavens existed long ago , and an earth formed out of water and by means of water , [  um ] through which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished . ^ " all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation . " ^ - this is surely the theory of uniformitarianism ! ^ the passage above is talking about people who say that there was no flood - that the world is as we know it now ( the present is the key to the past ) . ^ this is not what the  ame teaches . ^ the  ame teaches that " the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished . " this is an argument against the assumptions that you base dating methods on . ^ we cannot judge the past from the present because the world that existed before the flood ( if the flood happened then it happened within recorded history ) is not the same as the world that now exists . ^ this passage is from the new testament - it is most certainly not metaphorical ! ^ c ya " ^  ame ^ " t.s.  ame " wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^  ame wrote : <text_embedded> ^  ame & friends , ^ interesting email . ^ i do not think it is as clear-cut as your friend would have us think . ^ just because science suggests something at this stage in history does n't mean that subsequent discoveries will not mean that our current hypotheses ( for after all , this is all we have ) must be radically changed / revised . </text_embedded>^ however , at this time , science indicates with overwhelming evidence that what i say is true . <text_embedded> ^ having said that , it is obviously important not to ignore what science is telling us today , </text_embedded>^ then why do you ? ^ ( ouch ) ^ and since you obviously want to talk about <text_embedded> ^ 'scientific " issues , here is where i stand , for your perusal : ^ age of the earth : i will make no statement on how old i think the earth is - i have no idea . ^ if it is billions of years old , this does not affect my faith or my 'scientific " beliefs , but i do wonder what was happening during that vast length of time , </text_embedded>^ if you have an evening , i 'll take you through the geological history of , say the british isles , and together , we can watch it change lattitde , climate , go below sea level , be part of mountain chains ( about  um , if i remember correctly ) and other fun things too . ^ and also why  ame has told us <text_embedded> ^ nothing about it . </text_embedded>^ he has given us the rocks , which speak for themselves . ^  ame , lineations , minerals which form at specific temperatures and pressures , fold , river channels , lag deposits , fossil beds , asteroid dust deposits ... ^ if it is a number of thousands of years old then it <text_embedded> ^ does not surprise me . </text_embedded>^ it would seriously surprise me . ^ i do not have a problem at all with  ame having <text_embedded> ^ 'deceived " us or something ( as your friend suggests ) . </text_embedded>^ just because i <text_embedded> ^ cannot understand something in light of what i see around me ( science ) does not mean that the thing cannot be true and i must be right . </text_embedded>^  ame , i do n't quite understand that sentance . ^ re  ame , i do n't know enough to discuss it knowledgeably . <text_embedded> ^ any other issues - let me know . </text_embedded>^ what do you think of flood geology ? <text_embedded> ^  ame </text_embedded>^  um important point . ^ shall we keep this to e-mails ? ^ i do n't want it to dominate our down time , when we are meant to be relaxing after hard days of revision . ^ also , if we ever get to far , and you start hating me , tell me to stop talking about this . ^ it is n't worth it , as it ai n't a salvation issue . ^  ame <text_embedded> ^ " t.s.  ame " wrote : <text_embedded> ^ guys , i hummed and hawed about sending this on to you , as i 've only just cooled down from the weekend , and i do n't want to get het up about it again , but i sent an e-mail to  ame  ame , a geologist in  ame , who is in my home group , and whom i hold in the highest respect re our favorite topic . ^ for the sake of both sides , read what he says . ^ you do n't have to , and i do n't want this to divide our friendship , guys , but i thought that i would keep screaming in my head if something was n't said . ^ love you all loads , and thanks for the great day yesterday . ^  ame ^ hi  ame , ^ thanks for the emails - you obviously had a great time away ! ^ as to the creation /  ame earth business . ^ do n't get too upset about it . ^ i think people are doing a great deal of harm , but they are usually willing to say  ame is white when pressed . ^ saying that radiometric dating is unreliable is as silly as saying radio waves are unreliable ( when you change to channel  um , you usually get something with pictures and sound , unless there is a freak weather situation ) . ^ likewise dating . ^ when several different decay schemes are used on the same rock , each with its own different half life , and give the same age ( concordance ) the method ca n't be said to be false . ^ the half lives of some decay schemes are among the most precisely measured constants in physics - e.g. the  ame clock which now replaces our world 's measurement of time . ^  ame can go wrong - things such as weathering , or reheating rocks above their  ame temperature ( which resets their clocks ) can occur - but they are the analog of the freak weather conditions in the tv example - understandable situations which can usually be checked . ^ i also do n't believe our  ame plays silly games with us . ^ he would not give us the gift of scientific enquiry only to turn round and say -  ame ha ! ^ i only put those old-looking fossils there to fool you . ^ i think a lot of the problems people with a young earth viewpoint have stem with a fear that  um day science may pull the carpet of faith from under them . ^ but if  ame has made everything , science will never undermine what he 's done or prove he did n't do it ! ^ below i have lifted out bits of articles from the christians in science website . ^ it is well worth looking at some of the material there , and following links to other articles and books . ^  ame the term goes well ( and exams are not too harsh ) ^  ame <text_embedded></text_embedded></text_embedded></text_embedded></text_embedded></message_body></message>
