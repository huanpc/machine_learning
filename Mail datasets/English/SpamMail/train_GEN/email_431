^ why ca n't i tell &name you went shopping ? 
^ does n't he like you helping old people ? 
^ if &name were ever to get caught by the police , i am sure they would not prosecute him after interviewing him and " let 's look at what heroin really means " for &num solid hours would probably put them off .

^ he has a lot of that lying around " .
