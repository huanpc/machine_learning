^ target volunteers needed ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ have you heard of the target scheme to encourage applications to &name from state school students ? 
^ this is a highly effective and well established scheme that works by us normal ( ? ) &name students going into state schools in our local area during the &name holidays and chatting to a few sixth formers about what it 's really like to be at &name and to try and dispel some of those myths that surround &name . 
^ we also run a 'shadowing scheme " in february and march where a small number ( &num or &num ) state school students come and spend a weekend ( thurs afternoon to saturday lunch ) in each of the colleges shadowing one of us , so they can see all the " krazee " student antics we get up to ! 
^ how can you get involved ? 
^ basically , i 'm recruting for both the target talks and the shadowing scheme now so i have a contact list for all the people who are interested in the target activities that go on throughout the year ( there 's even a way to earn a bit of money by doing some workshops at the start and end of each term ) . 
^ also if you are interested in being shadowed you need to be police checked and this is taking &num months at the &name ( aaargh ! ) . 
^ pleeeeease do n't worry about being too nervous to talk to people , or if did n't come from a state school yourself . 
^ you 'll get a bit of training nearer the time and we want every student who is interested to get involved because we need loads of people to get out there and publicize &name , also most of all its great fun ( i promise , would &char lie to you ? ) . 
^ an extra incentive to volunteer is that there is a league table of the number of volunteers for the target talks , from each college we can recruit and we did brilliantly last year ( 5th with &num volunteers ! ) but we can do even better . 
^ what do i need to do now ? 
^ just fill in the form below stating which bits of the scheme you are interested in and send it to me ( &email ) by this wednesday ( 30th oct ) . 
^ if you just want more info any of the target and access stuff in &name just fill in the top of the form and i 'll stick you on the email list and you can get in touch with me by email or collar me when you see me round college ( i 'm the ginger northern one ! ) .
