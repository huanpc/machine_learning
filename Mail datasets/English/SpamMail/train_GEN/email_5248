^ the ncmod with " palestinian &name &name &name " was extracted . 
^ does this count as a yes because palestinian is used in attributive position to modify activist , or no because it thinks it 's modifying &name , which is n't attributive position ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ well , it depends whether you 're counting the attributive / non-attributive distinction , or the correct attachment : yes if the first , no if the second , presumably . 
^ how on earth &name managed to get this analysis is a mystery , incidentally .

^ &num well it be+s nothing to get upset about 
^ xcomp " upset &name nothing &name " . 
^ is this predicative ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ it 's predicative but there 's nothing overt in the sentence that it predicates of . 
^ to decide the answers to things like these , you need to ask yourself who or what is upset - in this case ( which is unusual ) it 's contextually given ( it 's the addressee perhaps ) . 
^ like do n't get upset " or do n't be upset " - i.e. the imperative - it 's the understood subject .

^ &num after all , word+s like wispy and short mean different thing+s to different people , she say+ed 
^ xcomp " wispy &name word &name " . 
^ is this predicative ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ not really - again this is an exceptional case - this time the word should really have been in quotes . 
^ the speaker is talking about the word itself , not using it to denote the concept . 
^ &name
