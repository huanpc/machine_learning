^ hi &name 
^ thanks for the key - hope the note made sense . 
^ re : flowers - sorry i did n't have time to get any today as am in the midst of an essay crisis for tomorrow morning , but i could always get some tomorrow lunchtime if you wanted as i 'll be in town then . 
^ its a lovely gesture and i know they 'll really appreciate it . 
^ to be honest i 'm no expert when it comes to flowers either , and am not really sure where to go . 
^ i know &name and &name do pot plants and some flowers but i 'm sure there must be florists around too . 
^ the market also has some although they wo n't be as nicely presented . 
^ i 'll ask around and see what my friends reckon , but if you want to get them before then then i 'd suggest some brightly coloured &num for &name ( red , yellow or purple ) and perhaps softer colours for &name ( pink , white ) . 
^ these are only suggestions , though ! 
^ let me know what you think 
^ love &name
