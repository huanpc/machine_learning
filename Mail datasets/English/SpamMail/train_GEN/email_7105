^ when you open control center - ) system notifications , you are presented with the " &name system guard " notifications by default . 
^ i do n't think this is what most users expect , they expect " &name system notifications " . 
^ in general the usability of this window is bad , &name . 
^ the droplist is as wide as the window , which makes it look like a title bar . 
^ visually you then to &name this as meta information . 
^ maybe it should be a tabbed window , or a more narrow droplist . 
^ speaking of control center : should n't 'desktop " be on top of the list instead of " &name & &name " ? 
^ for instance , when you work from the top down , you first get to choose the wallpaper of your desktops , even before you configured how many desktops you actually want .
