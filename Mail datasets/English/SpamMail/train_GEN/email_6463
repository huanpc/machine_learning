^ i 'm wondering , do most &name application names really need to start with the letter &char ? 
^ to me , this is the most annoying aspect of an otherwise well-working desktop environment . 
^ while including the letter i can make it easy to spot a &name application , is this feature all that useful ? 
^ and does n't it lead to confusion among newbies when &name applications have names starting with &char anyway ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ actually it avoids confusion .

^ in my humble opinion , names like &name and kontour look like an exercise in bad spelling . 
^ do n't misunderstand me , the names themselves are completely okay , but why not spell them with the &char they are supposed to be spelt with ? 
^ currently , this &char naming convention is n't even maintained consistently , for example &name and &name instead of &name and &name ( or &name ? ) . 
^ most names do n't start with a k-sound at all , but get a k thrown in anyway . 
^ why &name instead of node ? 
</text_embedded>

^ using a naming convention allows something that is otherwise very hard to achieve - to use a description in the name . 
^ everybody knows what &name , &name and kspread does by just reading the name . 
^ but nobody will know what " evolution " does by just reading the name . 
^ so the name alone gives away some information : that the app is integrated in &name and often also what it does . 
^ this is a good thing for everybody without any serious drawbacks , &name . 
^ ( seriously , if you are offended by " k' -names , i think you will be just as offended by phantasy-names ) 
^ in the windows-world a similar thing is done with the " &name " prefix , on &name they start to use the " &char " prefix and on classical &name , graphical apps are often prefixed with " &char " . 
^ gnome uses " &char " which was a mistake &name because very many non-graphical gnu-apps already use it . 
</text_normal>

^ based on my own experience , non-technical people tend to think &name is somehow related to &name &name , and get confused and annoyed when it does n't look and behave the same way ( especially with relation to file formats ) . 
^ considering how much time is being spent writing these good and useful applications , would n't it be worth giving it a unique name ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that is exactly the point . 
^ &name is releated to &name - it has the same function . 
^ if you need a substitute for &name on &name , &name is the application to use . 
^ - so if uses started kword to operate on &name &name files , they did the right thing ( or is there any other &name application that tries to understand &name &name files ? 
^ i do n't think so . ) , so the name was perfect . 
^ i agree that kword 's &name filters leave a lot of room for improvement , but that 's hardly the fault of the application name . 
^ &name is still the only ( and therefore best ) way to manipulate &name &name files , so yes , &name &name users should be encouraged to use kword . 
^ &name 
^ if it 's not on fire , it 's a software problem .
