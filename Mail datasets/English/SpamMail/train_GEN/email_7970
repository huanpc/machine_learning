^ subject : best chain letter 
^ &name , my name is &name and i suffer from the guilt of not forwarding &num billion &char * cking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on , a poor 6-year-old girl in &name with a breast on her forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her to a travelling freak show . 
^ do you honestly believe that &name &name is going to give you , and everyone to whom you send " his " email , $ &num ? 
^ how stupid are we ? 
^ " &name , looky here ! 
^ if i scroll down this page and make a wish , i 'll get laid by every good looking model in the magazine ! " what a bunch of bullsh * &char . 
^ maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my house and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing a chain that was started by &name in &num &name and brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the mayflower . 
^ &char * ck them . 
^ if you 're going to forward something , at least send me something mildly amusing . 
^ i 've seen all the " send this to &num of your closest friends , and this poor , wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a nickel from some omniscient being " forwards about &num times . 
^ i do n't &char * cking care . 
^ show a little intelligence and think about what you 're actually contributing to by sending out these forwards . 
^ chances are , it 's your own unpopularity . 
^ the point being ? 
^ if you get some chain letter that 's threatening to leave you sh * gless or luckless for the rest of your life , delete it . 
^ if it 's funny , send it on . 
^ do n't piss people off by making them feel guilty about a leper in &name &name &name room &num &name house &name &name &name &name research institute &name road &name &num &name &name ( &num ) &num ext &num
