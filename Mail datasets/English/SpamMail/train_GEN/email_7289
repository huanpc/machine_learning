^ it was the &name 's health centre . 
^ they also asked how many units of alcohol ( which i halved ) and how much i weigh ( which i took a stone off ! ! ) . 
^ i get most of my meals cooked for me by my flatmates , but in return i have to do the washing up ! 
^ i find this perfectly acceptable as i would probably starve if the cooking was left to me ! 
^ i may have to go and visit &name as the bus that goes past the campus where i am ( just outside &name ) goes to &name ( where &name is ) . 
^ have a good time . 
^ i 'll see you at christmas . 
^ &name .
