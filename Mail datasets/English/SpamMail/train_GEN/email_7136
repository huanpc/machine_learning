^ thanks especially &name and &name for organising it and getting us there ( and for taking me to &name ) . 
^ i really enjoyed spending time with you guys and learning from you all and praying with you . 
^ i 'm missing you all since i 'm a bit lonesome up here in my penthouse without you noisy guys around ( please do n't feel sorry for me - that was just a desperate plea for sympathy &smiley ) , even if you do pick on me all the time . 
^ i hope you all had a great time too and have learnt lots . 
^ i 'll be praying for you all as you get back into your " locations " , and i 'd ask that you do the same for me .
