^ hi mr. &name , 
^ i have been in contact with &name about possibly visiting &name this week while i am in &name to discuss whether you might have any positions available for next year . 
^ she mentioned that you have been very busy recently with a big project , but things may have calmed down by this week . 
^ i was curious if this is indeed the case , and whether such a visit might still be possible . 
^ i am in &name for the next &num days , and will actually be in &name tomorrow visiting &org from &num : &num : &num , and would love the opportunity to stop by and visit at any time if things have calmed down . 
^ anyway , i hope all is well , &name
