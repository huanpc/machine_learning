^ sorry ! 
^ that would be my fault . 
^ here is the real thing . 
^ &name 
^ hi 
^ i 've just been reviewing the programme notes and i 'm having problems following the first paragraph . 
^ it looks to me like it 's suffered from being copied and pasted inccorectly somewhere along the line ( eg. i suspect the " ourt " before &name should be court ) . 
^ perhaps whoever has the correct version could let me have it to include in the final draft ? 
^ here 's what i have : 
^ born in &num in &name , from the age of &num &name lived and studied music with his elder brother . 
^ after a series of appointments as organist and briefly as chamber musician to the &name of &name . 
^ in &num he was promoted to the position of &name , but in &num left to become the cas a court musician , he became , in &num , court organist ourt &name to &name &name at c' then . 
^ from &num until his death in &num he lived in &name , where he was the director of music at the &name , with responsibility for the music of the &num principal city churches . 
^ i 'm about to do the proofs for everyone to review and shall print the masters for &name to copy tomorrow morning . 
^ thanks 
^ &name
