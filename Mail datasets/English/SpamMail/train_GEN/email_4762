^ &name &name , i 'm still having no joy getting this cron job running . 
^ i tried the simplest case : 
^ * * * * * &num 
^ also with quotes around the command : 
^ * * * * * " &num " 
^ but neither seem to be working . 
^ i copied the command directly from the crontab file and ran it to check that i had entered it correctly , and that was fine . 
^ any ideas ? 
^ cheers ,
