^ dear &name : 
^ hope you are now settled into your new abode at &name and getting back in the swing of things . 
^ we finally got a computer and &name is on it all the time . 
^ the novelty may wear off shortly . 
^ we may change our e-mail address at then end of the month as we do not have the &name provider of choice . 
^ &name wanted on the &name immediately but i did not have a &name for the &name provider i wanted hence the chance that may be forthcoming . 
^ &name has had a difficult weekend as he is busy doing painting and all i can here is a noise of constant moving from upstairs . 
^ i had been doing outside work , trying to clear up the leaves as we have a ton of them , until the rain started . 
^ the &name game was n't televised here , just the &name game which &name choose not to watch . 
^ ( it costs $ &num to $ &num to watch these games as they are brought in by satellite ) 
^ i talked to your dad yesterday , all seemed well , your sisters were their usual selves and &name was moving in for a couple of weeks as your mam is on holiday in &name . 
^ we had a great time in &name , it was unseasonably warm , over &num degrees all the time we were there . 
^ it was hot but still bearable as there is no humidity . 
^ we just missed seeing &name &name , she arrived the day we left , so that was too bad . 
^ &name to here from you soon , 
^ love &name & &name
