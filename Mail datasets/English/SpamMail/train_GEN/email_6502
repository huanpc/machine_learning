^ hello everyone 
^ hope you are having a nice relaxing evening ... 
^ &name has been very efficient and created the our &name repository on &name this evening , which you may have had a chance to look at . 
^ i would like to draw your attention to our current directory structure , copied below : 
^ societies / 
^ &name / 
^ &website &name / 
^ &name / [ &name special folder ] &website [ &name special file ] &name / [ an empty folder ] &name / [ the old &name repository ] prjlima / [ the new repository ] ( -- the new repository . 
^ src / [ the old src repository ] 
^ &website cgi-bin / &name - ) /societies / &name [ a symbolic link ] public_html viewcvs-0.9.2 www - ) public_html [ a symbolic link ] 
^ i would like to discuss the &name folder . 
^ the names of folders under societies / &name / &name / are slightly misleading , and might cause someone to mistakenly identify the wrong directory as our repository . 
^ &name has pointed out that the &name " and 'src " folders are remnants of the previous repository , and should not be deleted . 
^ you 'll remember that we agreed yesterday to create a repository called " &name " , in which we would create the submodules 'src " , &name " and others that we might need in the future , but be careful since this is currently not the case ! 
^ i would like to take this initiative in making the societies / &name / folder less ambiguous , before we get going tomorrow : 
^ i expect to perform this operation from &num : &num - &num : &num please could people check in their latest work * before * this operation starts . 
^ the final structure will have a single repository called " &name " . 
^ * * * no files will be deleted * * * , however some files may be moved to a new folder called societies / &name / archive / in such a way that they are easily identifiable . 
^ to prevent the persistent of old &name modules , i propose to rename the repository folder ( " &name " ) to 'repository " , so that future commits do not write the old file structure into the new one . 
^ i do not wish to cause anyone inconvenience , but if anyone feels unduly inconvenienced by this operation . , please get in contact straight away . 
^ my number is &num &num , and my phone shall be left on all evening up until 
^ &num &num a.m. 
^ i also have one small request : please could we create symbolic links in our own personal file-spaces , rather than in the shared &name file-space , since things can get very confusing very quickly if everyone did this . 
^ for example , there is a folder entitled " public_html " , and also a symbolic link to this folder called " www " . 
^ this is probably not necessary . 
^ it is very easy to create the symbolic links you need from your own filespace if you want . 
^ if anyone is unsure how to do this , i 'll be glad to help . 
^ in the meantime , thank-you for your patience , and hope you have a nice evening ! 
^ all the best 
^ &name 
^ " we are all in the gutter , but some of us are looking up at the stars . " &name &name
