^ those of you wishing to purchase a specific wine are advised to make that purchase before the dinner commences ie before &name , in order to minimise the queue lengths . 
^ dress code is black tie . 
^ official word on gowns has yet to materialise , so keep fingers crossed . 
^ see you there !
