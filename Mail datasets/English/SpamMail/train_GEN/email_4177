^ &name &name , 
^ hope you had a good &name and are looking forward to your final exams . 
^ sorry for not explaining the situation before , but my dad suffered an unexpected brain haemorrhage a week before the end of last term , and after &num operations ( the first to clip the artery , he was supposed to have been back at work in &num months but it went a bit wrong , and the second to remove part of his skull to relieve the pressure a bit ) we were told he would be gone in a day , then a week , then for an indefinite amount of time in a coma . 
^ then there was some movement in his right hand , and now the situation is very unclear . 
^ he is still in a coma but there is a possible chance of some sort of recovery , although we do n't know what , and it may mean that he has to live out the rest of his life requiring total care in a nursing home , although he is only &num , and was perfectly healthy beforehand . 
^ anyway , the doctors are very surprised that he has survived at all , since they believed he was brain dead for a while , and some people are reckoning that it is a miracle . 
^ ( we were told a few weeks ago that the chances of him waking up were a billion to &num , and now it seems it may be on the cards , he opened his right eye and waved last friday ) . 
^ whether he will recognise us or remember anything when or indeed if he does come round we do n't know , his left hand side appears to have shot it , and we were told that the part of his brain which controls consciousness had died , but now they do n't know . 
^ sorry to load this on you , but you did ask . 
^ i will probably come up to &name after the exams for a few days , depending on the circumstances , and again at the end of term . 
^ &name to see you then , 
^ &name .
