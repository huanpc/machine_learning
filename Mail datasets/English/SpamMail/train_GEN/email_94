^ dear all , 
^ the fireworks start at 7.30pm on midsummer &name . 
^ for anyone who 's interested ( up to certain numerical limit ) , the plan is to stroll over to my place after for some food ( at about &num - 9pm ) . 
^ i 'm at &num &name &name 's &name ( not &name &name 's street ) which is off park &name by &name &name .
