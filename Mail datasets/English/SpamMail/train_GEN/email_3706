^ &name ... i heard the rocks crying out , be praised for your tenderness for these works of your hands ... 
^ &name : that 's plagerism &name : i really do n't know what &name is going to say . 
^ &name : it 's not just plagerism , it 's blasphemous . 
^ &name : if only electrons could be seen , imagine this . 
^ &num hydrogen atoms walk into a bar ( or church for those christians out there ) one says to another , " hey , i think i 've lost an electron . " the other &num replies , in a suitably squeaky voice , " are you sure ? " the other guy replies , " yeah , baby , i 'm positive . " 
^ &name , bad chemistry joke , but then it 's chemistry after all . 
^ now serious geology jokes . ... 
^ &name ! 
^ &name : &name , a horse walks into a bar , and the bartender says . ...
