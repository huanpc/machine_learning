^ urm , still not sure of my plans , but would love to come . 
^ although i initially thought immediately after we break up would be the best time , it now seems to make more sense to go around august bank holiday weekend , as we wo n't be sick of the sight of each other , &name will be back from &name , and then if i do end up going to &name for july i 'll be back . 
^ &name ... cheaper the better , of course , but could probably stretch to &pound; &num , depending on how much it cost to get there etc. thank you or doing this , if you get fed up , let me know and someone will take over ! 
^ love , &name

^ &num when are you free ?
