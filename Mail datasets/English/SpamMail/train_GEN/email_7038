^ hi &name , 
^ its a good idea to have it all on the same day ! ! 
^ unfortunately i 'm not going to be able to do all of it because i ca n't afford to give up study time at this stage of the year &smiley so , i 'm going to come for 11am to praise &name and then leave at lunch - would it be possible to give my 'report " quite early on in the debrief session ? ? 
^ hope this is ok ,

^ dear all , 
^ i hope that this e-mail finds you well and not too stressed at the start of week &num . 
^ almost there ! 
^ 'do you not know ? 
^ have you not heard ? 
^ the &name is the everlasting &name , the creator of the ends of the earth . 
^ he will not grow tired or weary , and his understanding &num can fathom . 
^ he gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak . 
^ even youths grow tired and weary , and young men stumble and fall ; but those who hope in the &name will renew their strength . 
^ they will soar on wings like eagles ; they will run and not grow weary , they will walk and not be faint " &name &num : &num 
^ we shall be holding the concert debrief meeting , subject to everyone not replying and informing me that they cannot make it , on friday 14th march at 11am ( venue tba ) . 
^ basic plan : 
^ &num 30am - 11am : arrive ; &name , coffee , cakes 11am - 11.30am : prayer & praise 11.30am - &name : debrief and proposals for future , breaking for lunch in middle 
^ actually , i 'm not sure it will be going on that long , but it seems safer to allocate too much time than too little ... it is a christian meeting after all &smiley lunch will be provided . 
^ " you are all sons of &name through faith in &name &name " &name &num : &num 
^ if we could have reports from : &name &name &name &name publicity the &name treasurer either written to be given on the day , or if you cannot make it , then please submit your report to us before the day so that it can be given at the meeting and discussed . 
^ things to consider are things like what you did , how things went , what you think went well within your role , what things you did right & what was done wrong , what could be done better in the future , lessons learned etc. etc. 
^ it would be good to see as many as possible , but i realise that its going to be impossible to get everyone together . 
^ it would therefore be appreciated if you could let me know if you can make this or not ( or a 'maybe " if you do n't know ) . 
^ " he was pierced for our transgressions , he was crushed for our iniquities ; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him , and by his wounds we are healed " &name &num : &num 
^ take care 
^ love
