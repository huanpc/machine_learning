^ well hellooooooooo , &name &name . 
^ &name , does n't quite work like it did in friends . 
^ anyway . 
^ &name went ok , i think . 
^ i spent at least half an hour straight staring at this &num question i coudl n't get . 
^ it was really annoying cuz it was one of thise where i needed the answer to move onto the next question . 
^ grrrr. but it finally came to me . 
^ well , something did and i ended up with an answer so hopefully it was the right one . 
^ but because that was the make-up , and everyone else was clear of the exam over a week ago , we now have another physoics tutorial quiz tomorrow . 
^ could there be less physics please ? 
^ but no. so i 'll have to study for that . 
^ actually , i need to know what to study first , since i missed the first lecture of the new chapter when i was going to the phonics . 
^ &name .. oops . 
^ i would just read the textbook but there 's always all this extra stuff you do n't need to know . 
^ must track down my prof , which is easier said than done . 
^ this is the guy who looks like &name from &name . 
^ is it &name ? 
^ anyway , the guy , as opposed to the cat or dog . 
^ so &name . 
^ it 's quite scary speaking to him . 
^ for &name honours they want a &num average . 
^ my lowest grade for anything so far has been a &num . 
^ but cuz the finals have more weighting then i could still fuck everything up . 
^ aaaaargh the pressure ! 
^ what is this ( snippety snip snip ) shit all about ? 
^ i 'm confused . 
^ oh , by the by , dad was saying that heaps of the junk i forwarded to him was n't coming through . 
^ well , the attachments at least . 
^ all the other crap like people 's addresses was . 
^ just wondering if it 's the same with you . 
^ &name obviously got the bungee-jumping one so i 'm guessing you would have too . 
^ oh , so jealous . 
^ i really want to see sum &num . 
^ ok , i only know &num songs but hey , they still sound magic . 
^ acutally , there 's a few bands from over here playing over there just now , or soon . 
^ if you get a chance , you should try to see &name and &name eat &name . 
^ again , i only know a few songs but they 're great . 
^ did i tell you no doubt are coming to &name ? 
^ how long have i wanted to see them ? 
^ &name , so excited . 
^ &name , i do n't have a ticket yet ( since i 'm skinty-poo and they 're $ &num ) but that would be awesome ( tee hee - note the shitty canadian word - c'est ridiculous) . 
^ and did i tell you about &name ? 
^ &name , my memory . 
^ you like the taste of &name ? 
^ &name ! 
^ it tastes like liquorice for fucks sake . 
^ but then maybe that 's why you like it and why i hate it so much . 
^ i also hate it cuz &num night in tenerife at this crap nightclub , my friends , when getting a round , took to just asking the barman for &num shots of anything . 
^ eejits . 
^ so for the first &num rounds , we got sambuca so we downed them anyway . 
^ so for my round , i did the same again . 
^ but it was a different barman . 
^ who obviously knew about some bottle of the most vile drink in the universe that i think they must have been trying to get rid of for ages and finally found &num unsuspecting muppets to help with the situ . 
^ yes , this is the worst drink i was talking about . 
^ &name ran straight to the toilet after &name hers - i thought she was just spitting it out but no , it had come right back up . 
^ as for me , i kept it down but could taste it for the rest of the night so it was quite poops . 
^ &name the &name is flying home today . 
^ &name . 
^ if i go to the scots corner to watch the fitba now it 'll be with just &name &name . 
^ &name . 
^ &name " forward to that one . 
^ anyway , i should go . 
^ i have to email my soc &name cuz we have an assignment due on friday and i 'm not sure about , well , mot of it really but hey , it 's almost the weekend . 
^ &name , not quite really . 
^ see ya . 
^ &name luv , &name xx
