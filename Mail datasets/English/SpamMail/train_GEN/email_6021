^ &name , 
^ thank you for your e-mail . 
^ i have checked our records and the reason you are experiencing problems is because you are using the old &name sent to you in september . 
^ in january &num you requested a new &name letter . 
^ this would be a new number as it is a replacement letter . 
^ i have unlocked your account so if you would like to try it again . 
^ when you log in you need to be using your membership number followed by the password that you would have set when completing registration . 
^ the &name number is only used when you are completing registration or resetting your password . 
^ please let me know if you need any further assistance . 
^ &name regards 
^ &name &name &name & customer support advisor &num &num &email 
^ i tried logging in after not using my account for a long time & i was told that my account 's " temporary access " was expired and i should re-register . 
^ so i tried to re-register using the &name number sent to me last september , but in &name web browser i was told it was invalid , &name simply did n't do 
^ anything and opera told me that my account was disabled .
