^ &name , 
^ just a note to reiterate what &name has said . 
^ it is imperative that we have all the squad at the pub for a boozing session on wednesday . 
^ the club at the moment is going flat slightly due to the fact that most teams have finished matches and have very little to do . 
^ so it has been decided by the committee that we have a massive club social this week . 
^ those that whinge about having no money , have the incentive to get there for &num where it is likely that we could receive &num or &num jugs / crates on the house . 
^ we may use some fines money as well . 
^ depends wot people feel . 
^ i am also organising the dogs for quite soon . 
^ i need to know dates so any suggestions would be much appreciated . 
^ many thanks . 
^ carcas . 
^ message your friends in real time - and for free . 
^ get &name &name today !
