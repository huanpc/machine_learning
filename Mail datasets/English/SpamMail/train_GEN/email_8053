<text_normal> 

^ it turned to alcohol after i had an affair with the machine at work . 
^ for some reason it blamed itself , even though i insisted that it was nothing to do with the size of the &name on the graphics card . 
^ we tried a fresh start ( installing the latest version of linux ) but it got more and more depressed . 
^ it started binge-drinking during the day whilst i was away - i should have known something was wrong because i could smell the alcohol on its fan output . 
^ eventually the vodka frazzled its brain . 
^ sad story i know . 
^ much sadder than yours . 
^ heartless woman .
