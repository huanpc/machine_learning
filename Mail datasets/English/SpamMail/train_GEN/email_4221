^ hey &name 
^ thought it was time i wrote you a reply . 
^ i realise now that i sent the first e-mail to &email not tsfarewell . 
^ that would explain why you do n't have it ! 
^ i had a brilliant time in &name , and i 'll remember it for a long time . 
^ it was so much fun , and really reaffirmed some of my friendships , with est , &name and &name , so that was great . 
^ &num evening we played &name 's game , where you all secretly write down answers to the same questions and then guess who said what , and &num question was , who in &name 's do you most look up to ? 
^ your name came up twice ! ! 
^ i think you 've been a role model and good friend to a lot of us , &name ! 
^ thank you . 
^ how are you coping without &name ? 
^ have you heard from her ? 
^ i 'm really appreciating having an extended period of time with &name , normally it 's just a month here and a month there . 
^ have you made any progress with a job ? 
^ work for me has got a lot better , as i 've got to know people better and been able to have more in-depth conversations . 
^ i find small talk quite wearying ! 
^ this week &num girl , &name , was asking me about church , and why i got baptised ( ! ) , and what i believe , which was great ! ! 
^ it 's been a long time since i shared &name with a non-christian . 
^ i 'm really excited at the moment &name i 've got &num days off work , to go to &name &name ( plus the weekends before and after ) . 
^ ca n't wait ! 
^ life is so hectic at the moment that it will just be good to have loads of time that is focused on &name . 
^ &name and i have been chatting and making plans for cu next term . 
^ yeah , it would be great to have a really well attended prayer meeting ! 
^ i was thinking that with all the people who 've gone abroad this summer , we should get them to lead a prayer meeting , focusing on the country / continent they went to . 
^ we were thinking of asking &name to be the speaker on the next houseparty . 
^ well , that 's all my news . 
^ hope you 're well . 
^ loads of love &name

^ &name &name ! 
^ thanks for your honest thoughts on how you and &name manage . 
^ i know what you mean in part , that you have to remind yourself of your love , but then at other times , i certainly do n't need reminding , but instead would like a train ticket !

^ with &name in &name &name , and &num in &name &name ( i 'm going exploring the cities and road with my brother &name before we become old and married . ) we wo n't see each other for &num months , which will , by far , be the longest that we have been apart .
