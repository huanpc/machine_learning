^ hi &name , 
^ i tried to get a hold of your dad at the weekend to find out if you were finished with exams or still had more to go . 
^ but he 's a hard person to get a hold of . 
^ anyway hope all of your exams are over now and you are just enjoying yourself . 
^ i 'm sure you 've done quite well . 
^ are you getting a summer job in the south or will it be &name again ? 
^ we 're planning of coming over for just over &num weeks , leaving &name on july 12th , arriving &name on the 13th and spending a few days with &name before going up to the &name . 
^ nothing booked yet but that 's the plan . 
^ the weather here is really hot but it was quite cold up till a couple of weeks ago . 
^ last weekend was our first nice weekend in a while so we finally got some gardening done . 
^ &name is quite poorly with a sore throat and cold and feeling quite sorry for himself . 
^ anyway , i 've got to go now as i 've got to make some phonecalls before it gets too late .
