^ my name is &name &name and i am one of the coordinators at the soup kitchen in &name . 
^ could i ask you to pray for us at the moment ? 
^ we have had &num or &num unpleasant evenings recently , when volunteers have been on the receiving end of abuse from clients - it does n't happen that often . 
^ we are also looking for volunteers to help with certain groups . 
^ the soup kitchen has been in existence for about &num years . 
^ some of our volunteers are taking a well earned break , and we do need to replace them . 
^ it 's not exactly a thankless task , but it 's not always an easy one . 
^ churches together in &name : 
^ please pray for &name initiative to open coffee / christian literature shop in village . 
^ plans in early stages but a real commitment to move this forward . 
^ also there is a vision for initiating a sheltered housing scheme in village with support of &name , &name district council , &name parish council & a housing association .

<text_normal> 

^ the car has been found and &name and i are awaiting insurance inspectors advice on what to do next . 
^ i am continuing to work with the police to hopefully not only solve this crime , but also save others from having to share the , sometimes frightening , experiences that we have had this week . 
^ please could you thank all &name members for their prayers ( and vigilance ! ) , and encourage them all to continue praying for our local police force - whom , from what i have seen this week , are struggling to cope with the increased amount of crime being committed and the demanding pressures of their work . 
^ &name and &name : 
^ the next event in the &name &name ( following on from the church cluster which worked there for the noise ) takes place this sunday the 21st . 
^ football and food will be provided for the local young people at &name &name &name . 
^ please pray for the organisers , a good response and good behaviour from those who come , for the community , and for a good referee ! 
^ forthcoming courses :

^ give thanks for the powersurge event which took place at &name last wednesday . 
^ it is good to see the same group of young people returning again and again .

^ the next event will be a powersurge prayer breakfast from 9am - &num at &name &name 's on sat . 
^ 14th september , to launch the week of prayer . 
^ please pray for this to involve more churches , and for the publicity , which seems to not be functioning well at present .

^ give thanks for the wonderful weather , and a great time of prayer and fasting .

^ the call is for the church to move forward from the festival idea of play and feasting , into prayer and fasting .
