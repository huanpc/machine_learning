^ that is very good , buddio ! 
^ i 'm glad you got moved in ok . 
^ i 'm pretty shattered and am only just starting to feel slightly settled in here , though i am almost dreading the weekend , as there will be nothing to do except see people , as my first module will be done , and for once , that scares me . 
^ i guess i just do n't really want to make that many more good friends , though it would be great if i had some brilliant friends here . 
^ it is weird , but at college i would say that about &num 
^ - one of my friends were girls , as i just got on better with them on the whole , but here , i am very relectant to invite any over for coffee etc , as i do n't want them to get the wrong idea , and i do n't want to have to always mention &name , so that they leave me alone . 
^ i do n't really know what to do , cause it is like , i want to be friends with people , but certainly do not want a new girl . 
^ i guess i was never scared about meeting girls before , as i was always on the lookout for one , but now i have found &name , that search has stopped , and i am so , so happy ( except that we are &num miles apart most of the time ! ) do you understand what i am saying ? 
^ anyway , i am getting on well with the guys here , who are mainly foreign and in my house at least , trying to get better qualified so that they can get a job in something more interesting . 
^ i 'm trying hard not to be uppity , like , " went to a good university and got a good degree " but i sometimes have to catch myself . 
^ keep smiling , and in contact . 
^ you are a great friend . 
^ oh , you 'll love this , i 'm playing guitar at cu on wednesday ... it begins . 
^ take care of yourself , &name . 
^ &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ everything you 'll ever need on &num web page from &name and sport to email and music charts &website
