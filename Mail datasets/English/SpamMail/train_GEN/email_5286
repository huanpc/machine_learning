^ last year we agreed this ( excerpt from the &num minutes ) : 
^ &name &num international representation 
^ &name &name 
^ we agreed who would represent the &name in the various international events next year . 
^ in each case we clarified the criterion used to select the person for future reference . 
^ &name amateur go &name : this is decided by &name points . 
^ &name &name has the most ( &num ) , and so will be invited to go . 
^ next in order is &name &name ( &num ) . 
^ &name denso cup : this is a new event for strong players with generous sponsorship and the winner gets to represent &name in the japanese part of the event . 
^ anyone with a &name rating of &num or better can go and gets a proportion of their expenses paid . 
^ the &name can nominate &num representative who gets a higher proportion of their expenses . 
^ &name &name has already been invited with full expenses for being very , very strong . 
^ we decided that the place should go to the person from last year 's challenger 's league with the highest &name rating ( who is not already representing us at the world amateur ) . 
^ this is &char &name &name ( &num ) who accepted the invitation . 
^ &name cup : places are allocated for this tournament based on how well players from each country did at the european go &name . 
^ therefore we decided that the place should go to the person who did best at the european , namely &name &name ( 5th ) , reserve &name &name ( 21st ) . 
^ &name &name to pass on these invitations to the people concerned . 
^ i think that we have already agreed that &name &name is &name amateur rep ? 
^ at least i remember an email vote about this . 
^ &name &name , ( if we get to nominate someone , will be asked ? 
^ is the event even happening this year ? ) would be 
^ assuming that &name gets an automatic invite like last year : &num ) &name &name &num ( i assume not eligible ) &num ) &name &name &num &num ) &name &name &num &num ) &name &name &num 
^ for &name cup : 
^ ( according to the official results table . ) &num ) &name , &char &name 26th ( &num &name ) &num ) roads , &name 60th ( &num &name ) &num ) &name , &name 88th ( &num &name ) 
^ except , that &name actually won in rounds &num and &num , so his &name is really &num , so he should probably be second . 
^ &name .
