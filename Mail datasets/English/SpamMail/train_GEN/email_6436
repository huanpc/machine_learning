^ prayer requests for this week : 
^ the following , from the christian institute came in yesterday , but is for today ! 
^ house of lords second reading debate 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ monday 10th june 
^ do pray for &name &name as she speaks in the first debate on the &name &name in the house of lords . 
^ there will not be a vote at the end of the debate . 
^ &name &name will be arguing ( &name willing ) against the proposal to allow adoption rights for homosexual couples and live-in cohabitees . 
^ &name &name is recovering from a serious illness . 
^ please pray that &name will give her good health and great wisdom and strength as she prepares and speaks . 
^ please pray also for other peers to speak effectively against changing who is entitled to adopt . 
^ please pray also for myself , &name &name and &name &name who will be attending the debate and meeting peers . 
^ we are sure that there will be more than &num peers speaking on monday who are totally committed to gay rights . 
^ please pray that their arguments may be exposed . 
^ the &name &name is likely to take some time to make progress through the house of lords . 
^ apart from the proposal to allow homosexuals and cohabitees to adopt the rest of the &name is largely non-controversial . 
^ for this reason the &name will be subject to the " grand committee " procedure with votes not being taken during the committee stage . 
^ the key votes will be delayed until the report stage which might be as late as september or october . 
^ there is certainly time to build a campaign . 
^ we are very grateful for all your prayers .
