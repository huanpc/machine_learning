^ dear &name council , 
^ i have launched a centralised system for giving notices of attacks in and round the university . 
^ its aim is not to scaremonger , but we all should be aware of events that happen in &name so we can help students to take responsibility for their own safety . 
^ you should keep me informed of incidents in and around your colleges , so i can circulate this information to all women 's officers via email . 
^ the women 's officers will then liaise with the tutorial advisers and porters in your colleges in order to make sure they have up-to-date information . 
^ this way information can be exchanged via a central point and circulated back to the colleges through your undergrad and grad email lists . 
^ the victim 's permission should be sought before you contact me with information of an attack . 
^ as much information about the attack should be included as possible , and it would be useful if you could title the email " safety notice- urgent' . 
^ all emails to me &name holly on &email . 
^ i will be available to help any victim of an attack talk to the police , should they wish . 
^ i am also available for confidential information and support . 
^ &name is also becoming the newest reporting center for the open out scheme . 
^ this scheme hopes to encourage people to report incidents of &name crime , &name and &name . 
^ contact &email for more information . 
^ * the women 's officer reserves the right to edit any information about attacks .
