^ dear &name ( both old and new ) ! ! 
^ i hope you have just about survived the rigours of first term and have enjoyed all the social events the &name committee has organised for you . 
^ i 'd like to especially thank both &name and &name for the hard work they have put in over the last term and look forward to everything they have in store for us in the new year ! ! 
^ in order for &name to be successful in offering you with goodies like mince pies and those gorgeous flumpy things ... not to mention the chocolates , after the grad guest nights or to put on cocktail parties , garden parties ( when the weather is better of course ) not to mention the movies every week , we need to be constantly replenishing our social fund . 
^ despite the rumours , we ai n't got bottomless pots of money and we do need to get funds from somewhere so you all can continue to enjoy yourselves in the style in which you 've become accustomed ! 
^ so now the bit where i ask you for money ... have you been softened up enough yet ? ? 
^ every year in the past , graduates have had no reservations to having the amount of &num pounds added on to their college bill next term as a contribution to this social fund . 
^ so i am writing to inform you all of this in advance and to give everyone a chance to air any great objections they might have . 
^ if you do object could you please e-mail me and i 'll make sure that you do not get charged . 
^ i really hope that most people will not hold any objections to this so we can continue to offer some great social events for the rest of the year ! ! 
^ thank you and i hope you all have a great christmas . 
^ see you in the new year !
