" it is true that  ame did stress " the very speculative nature of his conclusion " . ^ he suggested the amount falling was  um million tons per year . ^ even this lowest figure would give much more dust than is found . ^ so , although  ame did stress his results " 'speculative nature " , he would surely not have allowed his conclusion to be so radically revised to that of only about  um inches of dust . ^ however , the author of this article gives the impression that he would . ^ this author also fails to state that a thick layer of dust was the consensus of many other scientists . ^  ame  ame ( in  um ) predicted a layer of dust several miles thick ;  ame ( in  um ) proposed a vast quantity of dust on the lunar plains ; and  ame ( in  um ) wrote : " i get a picture , therefore , of the first spaceship , picking out a nice level place for landing purposes coming slowly downward tail-first and sinking majestically out of sight . " note that all of these were written before  ame 's calculation , and therefore cannot have been influenced by it . ^ later on , and in this same spirit ,  ame wrote his report ( in  um ) ; and  ame ( in  um ) anticipated dust  um of metres thick . ^ now here we had a test . ^ evolutionism and ideas of an ancient earth consistently claim to be science , whilst consistently remaining untested ( the very criterion necessary for a theory to be deemed 'scientific " ) , but here was a test . ^ on the assumption of a  um billion year-old moon , the evolutionists predicted vast quantities of dust . ^ this was , therefore , one of the few critical tests that could be conducted in order to determine who was right . ^ such was the evolutionary bias of nasa , that they actually equipped their first moon landing probe with spikes on its feet , so as to help in land on in a sea of dust ; and in fact even fitted it with a spring loaded american flag in the top , so that if it sank beneath a mountain of dust , the flag might just pop out above ! ^ well , of course , the craft landed , and the  ame broke off : there was no need for that flag ! ^ whatever qualifying remarks you make , evolutionism had failed the test . ^ old-earth theories predicted  um thing , and the facts said something quite different . ^ even if these facts can be re-worked into the old-earth idea , that fact remains the same : here was a rare test between young and old earth ideas . ^ the old earth idea totally failed . ^ " this leads the authors of the book scientific creationism , published in  um , to argue that if the  ame were  um billion years old , as astronomers claim , it should have had several feet of dust on its surface , not a few inches . ^ they even say that astronomers were dismayed by how little dust there was . ^ this last comment , which is repeated in other such books , is quite untrue . ^ the amount of dust on the  ame was a matter of great interest to nasa . ^ a very thick layer would have made landing on the  ame , and moving around on its surface , difficult . ^ leaving it again might also have been problematical . ^ however , by  um , a year before  ame landed , it was clear that there was nothing to worry about . ^ satellites orbiting above the earth 's atmosphere had been used to measure the amount of dust in space , and on this basis it had been estimated that there would be a layer of dust about  um inches thick on the  ame , if meteoric dust alone were the cause . ^ ( this work , and other evidence , was surveyed by  har  har  ame in  um in  ame , vol.  um pp.  um ) . ^ of course , there would be more than that because there was evidence of past volcanic activity on the  ame , and that would produce dust too . ^ so the  um inches actually found was more or less as expected . " no , it was n't expected . ^ true , ideas had surfaced in  um that there might not be as much dust as previously thought , since photographs of the surface failed to provide any evidence of its existence . ^ however , this did not mean that such a thin dust layer was expected . ^ had it been expected , they would not have fitted the first ( unmanned ) lunar probe with that spring-loaded flag . ^ it was only after that space probe proved that the previous evolutionary ideas were wrong , that they were forced to change . ^  ame , is n't it , that the work this author quotes was only written after the whole series of events happened ? ^ i 'd like to know whether or not the majority of evolutionary scientists , before the direct observational evidence emerged ( the very thing providing the test ) , thought there would be a lot of dust or only a very little bit . ^ i 've seen nothing but evidence they thought there would be lots . ^ there you have it : the evolutionary prediction was wrong . ^ 'since this evidence had been published in  um it is surprising that a book claiming to be scientific , published  um years later is unaware of it , or ignores it . ^ one of the basic rules of good scientific work is that you must keep up to date with what is being published in the area in which you are working . ^ if you fail to do this you risk basing your conclusions on out-of-date evidence or disproven arguments . ^ it is amazing to find people associated with what is called the institute for creation research falling into this basic trap . ^ it undermines confidence in the quality of their science and their research . ^ it is even more amazing to find a book published in  um ( the facts of life by  ame  ame ) , and highly acclaimed by advocates of the " young earth " theory , still quoting the argument about the lack of dust on the  ame , based solely on  ame 's  um paper , and apparently totally ignorant of all the relevant new evidence that has accumulated in the  um years since then . "  ame , i would suggest that this argument is rather " knit-picky " . ^ could some better argument not be found ? ^ is this the greatest " inaccuracy " that can be found in all of the creationist literature ? ^ is it such an evil fabrication that it warrants an entire article to villify the whole book on this  um statement ? ^ i would suggest not , but you may not agree . ^ so , before examining the argument , i hope you will agree that the accuser 's statements must stand up to similar scrutiny . ^ if not , the accuser is a hypocrite . ^ after all , ^ " and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother 's eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? ^ or how wilt thou say to thy brother , let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ? ^  ame hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye . " (  ame  um :  um ) ^ as you 'll see , this article does n't stand up to such scrutiny . ^ the author stated : ^ " advocates of the " young earth " theory [ are ] still quoting the argument about the lack of dust on the  ame , based solely on  ame 's  um paper , and [ are ] apparently totally ignorant of all the relevant new evidence that has accumulated in the  um years since then . " ^ this is simply untrue . ^ instruments left behind on the moon show that the number of micrometeorites arriving on the moon is in line with the high value initially expected . ^ also , and abandoned spacecraft there showed many more impacts than expected , confirming the higher infall rate . ^ at such a rate , the moon should have massively more dust existing on it than it does . ^ so , who is n't keeping up to date with the new evidence ? ^ how can  um lambaste the scientific creationism authors ( who may have simply been unaware of the  ame paper ) for not reporting the latest evidence , when one does not do it oneself ? ^ the statement also contains another serious inaccuracy : the claims about lunar dust are not " based solely on  ame 's  um paper " , but , as i have shown , on the work of  ame ,  ame ,  ame and  ame as well . ^ i suggest the author should check his facts before telling others to do so . ^ and , by the way , why pick on the creatist literature ? ^ i have a children 's encyclop'dia ( printed in the  um ) at home , which sites " embryonic recapitulation " ( the idea that unborn babies pass through their evolutionary ancestry whilst growing ) as evidence for evolution . ^ the " evidence " was found to be fraudulent  um years ago ! ^ other such evidences for evolution which are children are taught fall into a similar category . ^ " the fact is that the evidence of the surface of the moon does indicate its great age . ^ before  um artists " depictions of the surface of the  ame , such as the famous paintings produced by  ame  ame in the 1940's and "  ame showed extremely jagged mountains and rocks . ^ there was some reason in this . ^ the  ame has no significant atmosphere , so its surface cannot be eroded by wind and rain . ^ however , the pictures brought back by  ame  um and subsequent  ame missions show rocks and mountains that are rounded as if worn down by erosion . ^ examination of the rocks brought back to earth revealed the reason for this . ^ surfaces that had been buried in the dust are sharp and jagged . ^ those that had been exposed are covered with small pits . ^ these are , no doubt , the result of the impact of meteoric dust . ^ on the basis of the known average mass of interplanetary dust grains and the velocity with which they strike the  ame ,  ame and  ame estimated the rate of erosion of the  ame 's surface . ^ the figure they arrived at was about  um feet in a billion years . ^ in reality it would be much less than this because the debris is not removed and so forms a protective covering of dust which absorbs the impact of subsequent meteorites . ^ however , even at the maximum rate , in  um ,  um years ( the kind of age of the earth that the authors of scientific creationism argue for ) the surface of the moon would have been eroded by  um millionths of an inch , producing a virtually undetectable coating of dust ! ^ this work was published in  um and should have been known , and taken into account , by the authors of scientific creationism . " again , this calculation is based on the low estimate of dust arrival , which as  um have shown , is at least questionable ( if not downright wrong ) . ^ also note that we have n't got a clue what conditions were like on the moon in the past . ^ 'does the failure of these authors to be up to date really matter ? ^ yes , for several reasons . ^ first of all , christians should be concerned about the truth . ^ the  ame we are committed to is the  ame of truth (  ame  um :  um ) . ^ of all people , christians should be most punctilious about using only those arguments that are based on sound methods of scholarship and the best evidence available . ^ this is a matter of obedient christian discipleship , not simply a desire to look good in the eyes of other scholars . ^ secondly , following from this , it is dishonouring to  ame when christian scholars are found to be using sloppy arguments based on out-of-date evidence - and i know secular scholars who have little respect for christianity because of this . ^ finally , it is a matter of considerable pastoral and evangelistic importance . ^ christian scholars who wrongly claim to be presenting sound 'scientific " arguments are misleading their fellow christians who read their books . ^ most of these readers do not have either the opportunity or the inclination to check up on the reliability of the arguments used and evidence presented . ^ some of those readers may in time be stumbled in their faith because of their misplaced confidence in what they have read . ^ christian students who , with more zeal than  ame , confidently confront lecturers with arguments culled from books like scientific creationism have sometimes been made to look foolish when the lecturer has been able to show that the argument does not stand up to the evidence , even the evidence available when it was first put forward . ^ that has not only shaken the faith of the christians , but undermined their witness to their fellow students . ^ perhaps publishers of books on 'scientific creationism " , and the managers of bookshops which sell them , ought to consider putting a spiritual health warning on them . " as i have shown , the author of this article is a hypocrite , because he himself is " behind the times " with his evidence . ^ there is plenty of evidence that the moon was specially created only thousands of years ago : there is no known mechanism that could create the earth-moon system ; the tidal pull would have caused the earth to spin much faster in the past , creating a massive tidal bulge ; the moon is receding from the earth far too quickly to allow them both to have existed billions of years ago ; the lunar soil is n't mixed enough ; etc. etc. etc. however , i note particularly his ignorance of ( or at lest refusal to mention ) the implications of the existence of this dust . ^ there exists a band of this dust orbiting the sun , which causes the " zodiacal light " just before sunrise and just after sunset . ^ as it orbits , it experiences a force outwards and a force inwards , both caused by the sun 's radiation ( the inward force is caused by a process called the "  ame effect " ) . ^ this causes small particles to spiral out of the solar system , and large  um to spiral into the sun . ^ after only  um million years , it would all be gone - but it 's still here ! ^ perhaps this is why the " encyclopaedia britannica " does n't mention the  ame effect as for 'spiritual health warnings " , i 'd simply note that evolution destroys the very reason why  ame had to become man and die for us : " for since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead . ^ for as in  ame all die , even so in  ame shall all be made alive . " (  um  ame  um :  um &  um ) ^ if man did n't bring death (  ame did , because he used evolution millions of years before man arrived ) , then obviously  ame ca n't bring us resurrection from the dead . ^ " for if the dead rise not , then is not  ame raised : " (  um  ame ^ 15:  um ) ^ put spiritual health warnings on evolutionary books ; not creationist  um . ^ i hope this has all been useful for you ,  ame . ^ please tell me what you 'll be doing next year , so i can be praying . ^ your friend and brother , ^  ame . </text_normal></message_body></message>
