" this could be a way of saying the same thing in  um different ways ^ - after all , a colt is an ass . ^ the only way that this could n't be the case is if the " and " were disjunctive ( i.e. it ties together  um different things ) . ^ but that the word " and " is n't always disjunctive is proved by  ame  um :  um : ^  ame  um :  um who gave himself for our sins , that he might deliver us from this present evil world , according to the will of  ame and our father : ^  ame is our father , but the word " and " is still used , for it connects  um ways of saying the same thing . ^ the same could be true in  ame ( and  ame ) . ^ now , it might be objected that if such were the case ,  ame would not have mentioned the bringing of the ass 's mother - but although that seems reasonable , it could equally be argued that  ame just gave extra information that the other writers did n't. ^ after all , if every writer wrote about everything , not only would there be no point in having  um different gospels , but the one we would have would fill the earth with paper to write it ! ^ ( cf.  ame  um :  um ) . ^ besides , mother asses are reluctant to let their young away from them , so they probably had to bring the mother along for purely practical reasons . ^ since they were obviously only interested in the colt ( and also because they knew  ame had already written about it ? ) , the other gospel writers did n't put that bit in their accounts . ^  ame also writes : " and [ the disciples ] brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him [  ame ] thereon . " note that the word " thereon " refers to the clothes , not the colt and its mother . ^ the text says that they placed clothes on both , and that  ame sat on the clothes . ^ it would have been perfectly possible for him to sit on the clothes and yet not on the ass 's mother . ^ alternatively , he could have sat upon both , and , again ,  ame ,  ame and  ame just failed to mention that fact . ^ they would still have been entirely correct in asserting that he rode the colt (  ame does n't mention the clothes , but it does n't mean they were n't there ) . ^ however , this alternative seems less likely . ^ so , either  ame road just the colt , and its mother came along too ; or  ame rode both simultaneously . ^ either way , there is no contradiction . ^ there - i hope that helps . ^ there are many such apparent contradictions , but none is without resolution - a straightforward reading of the  ame encounters no real contradiction with the rest of it ; although it does encounter real contradictions with certain ideas in geology , biology , physics , etc. however , as i said , such ideas are not science , since we did n't observe the origin of man , or the formation of fossils , etc. however , what we have observed is strata being laid down , one upon the other , all at once , rather than the bottom  um first , and then another , and then another , etc. ( these are real laboratory experiments which can be repeated today - i have seen video-tape footage of them ) . ^ similar results were seen at the explosion of mount  ame  ame . ^ experiments have also shown that fish , for example , decay and become dismembered by currents in a matter of days or weeks . ^ however ( as you probably know ) , we know of millions of well-preserved fossil fish . ^ some have delicate soft tissue preserved , and the preservation of the gills and muscles of those in the  ame  ame (  ame ) have led geologists to believe they were fossilized within  um hours of death ! ^ why , i 'm even looking now at picture of a fossil fish halfway through swallowing another fish ! ^ obviously , these show that they were buried and fossilized quickly ( not over hundreds of thousands of years ) . ^ so , since there is a good body of evidence to counter geologists " assumptions of an ancient earth ( not to mention the whole heap of problems such ideas run into when they meets physics - e.g. the amount of dust on the moon , or nickel in the oceans , or the existence of short-period comets , or the motions of the moon , and of the tides , or the decay of earth 's magnetic field , or the shrinkage of the sun , etc. etc. etc. ) , is it not a better idea to listen to the only observer who was there , who ca n't lie , and who told us what happened in our  ame ? ^ i 'll leave you with the very final words  ame wrote in his first letter to  ame : ^  har  ame , keep that which is committed to thy trust , avoiding profane and vain babblings , and oppositions of science falsley so called : which some professing have erred concerning the faith . ^  ame be with thee . ^ amen . ^ i 'll see you around , ^ your friend and brother , ^  ame . </text_normal></message_body></message>
