) ,  ame (  ame ) ,  ame  ame and  ame (  ame ) ,  ame and myself . ^ please pray for each one of us - as you can see , we are a culturally diverse team , by no means a mono-australian team . ^ a few weeks back , when we had a retreat for the trip , we really made use of the opportunity to get to know each other better . ^ as we understood where each of us was coming from , what sort of personalities we all have it is my utmost prayer that we may work as a team in good and bad times so that  ame 's glory may be fulfilled . ^ please remember each of our health , as we have been warned about our adaptability to the spicy  ame cuisine ! ^ we all need a prepared heart for the trip , for the-whatever-degree-of spiritual warfare that we are going to be involved in. as we all have different backgrounds as a christian , and lots of other things , work , preaching , exams , assignments running up to the departure date , i pray that we may all be equipped spiritually as we go into his mission field . ^ thirdly , may i also ask you to pray for us and especially  ame  ame as he draws up a set of ideas , dramas and songs for our visits and ministry with the teenagers . ^ prayers for sensitivity , appropriateness of the messages are most needed , as we are all foreigners going into their culture , we may offend people in unintentional ways . ^ we will have almost a week in  ame before we start our tasks in  ame  ame , so it would be good if we could use the time wisely to improve our  ame and activity plan . ^ do not forget to pray for the  ame people . ^ bearing in mind that in  ame 's eyes , we are all his creation , and he does n't want anyone to be fallen . ^ please pray that  ame will show mercy to them , to the individuals , even though they have turned away from the  ame for centuries . ^ the  ame need your prayers that their hearts may be softened and quiet down so that they can hear his soft voice of calling . ^ remember how privileged we are , and yet there are so many lives waiting to be saved . ^ this week , i saw  um friends off  ame whom i wo n't see for a few months . ^ it 's amazing how  ame has provided me with such spiritual brothers and others since i arrived here barely  um months ago . ^ there are plenty of friends , experiences i want to give thanks for . ^ but i want to encourage us all to think of the possibility of extending our friendship to non-christians it 's a mandate not an option . ^ they are precious in  ame 's eyes . ^ in our respective mission fields - workplace , school and family , we can all make a difference by extending our hospitality , etc. to them . ^ please pray for us all in the team that we may all learn a great lesson of caring for the mission field , i.e. remembering our non-christian contacts that we will be establishing in  ame . ^ it is often true that we give up praying for our non-christian targets after sometime , may we have the patience to see  ame 's fruits yielded . ^ do believe in the power of prayers . ^ there are hundreds of minute details that we need to take care of before we go off . ^ please pray for a smooth preparation , especially for  ame and  ame who are the team leaders . ^ brothers and sisters , thank you for reading my prayer email once again , i hope this email finds you well . ^ do you know how much your prayers are valued in  ame 's work ? ^  ame , especially the prayer forces from all corners of the world ! ^ i would try to make a photograph of the team available to you in the next week . ^ and surely i will be emailing you all on the road once i find time . ^ lastly , if you have anything that can encourage me , please use this space too . ^ thank you all for committing yourself in the  ame 's work . ^ may  ame bless you this week wherever you are , take care of all your needs , and take away all your anxieties . ^ with love in  ame ,  ame @  ame ^ " the man who goes alone can start today ; but he who travels with another must wait until the other is ready .
