^ dear &name and &name , 
^ i asked my friend oli if he would have a look at the grammar for &name 's note . 
^ he was very kind in doing more than that and has re-written parts of what we had and suggested a skeleton outline for the remaining parts . 
^ there is comment on the changing nature of his oratorio texts : &website there is comment on english reception : &website 
^ i have the cover for &num in a book . 
^ i suggest that &name you scan it in. it has &num &name . 
^ &num : &num on the front in olde writing . 
^ if we cannot get this scanned in for you on time then i suggest just quoting &num &name &num : &num straight . 
^ maybe you could put the quote by &name in a different font and blow it up a bit . 
^ &name , would you like one of us to write a reason for the &name production ? 
^ ( &name suggested it as a natural last paragraph to link it all in ) . 
^ you may feel it necessary to add more to this , please feel free . 
^ &name suggested that it end up about twice the length that it is now ( &num ) . 
^ if you choose to use this , then please add &name &name to the list of thanks and as co-writer of the programme note . 
^ &name
