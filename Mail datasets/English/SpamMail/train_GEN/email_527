^ dear &name , 
^ " what do you mean you were complaining about my behaviour ? 
^ i am the model of exemplary decorum kind of but what did &name mean by 'she 's good for you " ? 
^ like i 'm some unpleasant tonic . 
^ i 'm almost offended . 
^ &name of . " 
^ - please , please , do n't be offended with me . 
^ you 're a very pleasant tonic . 
^ i think that &name and &char ( well , &num cannot speak for &name ) were slightly irritated at the way you seem to sometimes behave as though you are on the fastest and best roller-coaster at &name towers . 
^ i mean that sometimes ( most of the time ) you are absolutely lovely , and then ( and i think this annoys &name more ) you might seem to ignore someone . 
^ i think &name thought it would help broaden our experience of people to live with you - or something like that . 
^ it might improve our tolerance of people who are not always the way we would like them to be . 
^ another example would be the way i very often had to bite my tongue this year to stop myself flaring up at &name when he annoyed me . 
^ i succeeded , for the most part . 
^ however , you were not nearly so much of a trial , and i hope you will not be offended with me , because i like you and there is nothing at all amiss with your decorum in the normal sense . 
^ " well i do n't know . 
^ that does n't sound like &name at all " 
^ - well , it did look like &name . 
^ it also sounded like him . 
^ it might have been a very clever gag by &name &char , but i am doubtful of their aptitude in the fields of either holographic projection or advanced cybernetics . 
^ " i have sent &name an email apologising and saying that you and i are both equally to blame for &num things , and that you , &name and i are to blame for times-gate . " 
^ - thank you very much . 
^ " times-gate " ? 
^ as in " water-gate " ? 
^ i have put the items on your bill and you can take as long as you like to pay it off . 
^ " &name is not yet home ; she arrives on thursday . 
^ i am going to &name tomorrow to go on the eye and go to see a play , so i will not be able to send you an email tomorrow unless something goes drastically wrong but i will on thursday , promise ! 
^ ( unless i meet &name &name and he invites me out for dinner , in which case you may never hear from me again ) . " 
^ - is your sister flying home ? 
^ i hope you had a good time in &name . 
^ i have never been to &name . 
^ what play did you see ? 
^ did you meet &name &name ? 
^ i guess i shall not get a reply if you did . 
^ &name &name &name . 
^ " i will be online , hotmail wise on thursday eve , so we could have a chat if you email me a time- maybe 7ish ? 
^ i 'll look fairly early so you can go down to college . " 
^ - wonderful ! 
^ 7pm sounds great . 
^ i shall get down to college for then . 
^ i tried to download the hotmail messenger thing yesterday but the its service would n't let me , so would you mind using the &name &name thing that you downloaded earlier in the year ? 
^ it 's the product that the its uses and therefore i will be able to access it . 
^ i 'm looking forward to chatting to you this evening . 
^ i hope you have a lovely day . 
^ is it very hot in &name ? 
^ i got a letter from &name this morning . 
^ she says " are [ you ] still surviving in &name &name whilst we are all in the sunny south ? " well , it 's been really hot here too , although yesterday was n't quite as sunny . 
^ it 's splendid weather . 
^ oh dear , i 'm talking about the weather again . 
^ well , until this evening 
^ &name , 
^ &name
