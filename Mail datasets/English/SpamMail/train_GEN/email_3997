^ sorry to keep filling up your inbox ( you know you love it really ) ! 
^ &char quick last note about this week 's activities . 
^ for those who missed it , the &name service was great last night , and &name &name was excellent . 
^ if there 's anyone who 'd like to hear him again this week and fancies staying a couple of extra nights in a 2nd year 's flat ( or else in college ) in beautiful ( &name , wet , windy ... ) &name - just come along to the cu conference ! 
^ let &name or i know so that we can give them a list for fire regulations , tell us if you need somewhere to stay ( or just hang out ) and pay your &pound; &num on thursday morning . 
^ the conference starts at 9.30am on thursday - should be good . 
^ there are also still tickets for the ceilidh which you can buy on the door for &pound; &num . 
^ it 's in the &name &name &name ( &name 's) at 8pm on wednesday , so if you 're not coming to the conference but you 're stuck in college on weds night with nothing to do , come and join us at the christmas party . 
^ finally , there 's another service in the cathedral tonight - the &name 's advent service - before the formal , a much more cosy affair , and we hope to see you all tonight at the pantomime and bop ! 
^ if i do n't see you have a lovely holiday and a peaceful christmas with lots of fun and , more importantly , sleep ! 
^ love &name
