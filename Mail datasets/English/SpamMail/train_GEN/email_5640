^ hi guys , 
^ just to recap : the evening starts with mulled wine in the &name &name room at &name , then dinner in hall at &num . 
^ dress is black tie , and i 'm afraid the ruling is that gowns must be worn in hall ( but that does n't cover before and after ! ) . 
^ wine purchases can be made with your college card . 
^ looking forward to seeing you tonight , love & &name , &name 
^ add photos to your e-mail with &name &num . 
^ get &num months free * .
