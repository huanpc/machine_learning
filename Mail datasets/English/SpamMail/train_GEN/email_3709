^ hey &name , there you are &smiley 
^ yes , &name is &num , but he is not what i would call " old " in any other but the chronological sense . 
^ we spent a week together last year painting his &num foot canoe and he wore me out ! 
^ i 've never met a more indefatigable person ever . 
^ ( by the way , he has several canoes ! ) 
^ say , since you 'll be joining us , you 'll need an unfinished project . 
^ any ideas ? 
^ have you a copy of &name 's most famous book , northwest coast &name &name : an analysis of form ? 
^ if not , check it out . 
^ bring it and i 'm sure he 'd sign it !
