^ &name . 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ the buggers . 
^ better that they decided to fund you at the last minute , rather than not at all , though . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name ! 
^ are you quietly confident ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i have been tipped the nod .

^ i 've been seeing a fair bit of &name recently and we 've been getting on much better than we used to . 
^ but a few weeks ago , when i 'd been thinking that the &name boat had definitely sailed , i started seeing someone else . 
^ she 's very nice , but i still have strong feelings for &name . 
^ but then things did n't work with &name first time . 
^ &name . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

^ i 'm c++ing too , though .
