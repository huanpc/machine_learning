^ i 'm sure my parents would &name if i told them that i was thinking about marrying , but then i think i find it hard to talk to my parents about relationships anyway . 
^ i was talking to &name ( remember her - the nurse in our homnegroup ) last night about &name , and when &name &name in , i just froze up and did n't want to talk about that any more . 
^ why is that ?
