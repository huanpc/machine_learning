^ dear all , here 's something to brighten a dull day - a whole host of altruistic opportunities ! 
^ here they are : 
^ &num male volunteers needed for big siblings 
^ &num volunteers needed for sunday club 
^ &num &name &name &name 's - the old &num are now invalid ! 
^ &num company and help needed for a &num year old man 
^ &num &name 's aid needs more volunteers 
^ &num male volunteers needed for big siblings do you fancy the fun of being an older brother or sister to a child without the hassle of being related to them ? 
^ well here 's how ! 
^ big siblings volunteers are paired with the child of a lone parent , a child where there is a disabled member of the family , or with a child who has a disability . 
^ this project gives children a chance to get to know another adult outside the family , and gives both parent and child a break from each other . 
^ volunteers enjoy the opportunity to meet people in a relaxed home environment , escape the pressures of university life for a while , and have the perfect excuse to enjoy childhood pleasures again . 
^ you choose whether to be paired with a child with special needs or not . 
^ students usually meet their " little sib " weekly during term-time , although graduates continue through the holidays ( and are therefore much prized by parents and children ! ) . 
^ group activities are arranged , or you can take your little sib out to the local playground , go swimming , bike riding , walking , feeding the ducks , etc. , or even just watch tv with them . 
^ we provide a leaflet with suggestions for cheap activities and outings , and make sure that there are lots of group activities on offer too . 
^ obviously reliability is crucial as children and parents get very upset if they are let down . 
^ &name &name are particularly short of male volunteers at the moment - if you feel like you could get involved , please contact the office . 
^ &num volunteers needed for sunday club can you drink tea ? 
^ do you enjoy talking to people ? 
^ then this project is for you . 
^ between &num and 4pm on sunday afternoons volunteers visit &name place , a sheltered accommodation complex in &name road , to share tea , coffee , cakes and biscuits with the elderly residents who live there . 
^ whilst most of the afternoon can be spent in conversation , we usually also have some entertainment e.g. music or juggling . 
^ many volunteers in the past have commented on how much of a break it has 
^ been from their studies and the good friendships they have formed . 
^ to get involved with this project , pop along to the &name office . 
^ any queries , e-mail &email 
^ &num &name &name &name 's - the old &num are now invalid ! 
^ if you have one of the old yellow &name &name cards , could you please pop into the office with a passport photo to get a new one . 
^ cheers ! 
^ &num company and help needed for a &num year old man help is needed for a young at heart &num year old man who has had a stroke that has left him with problems finding the right words and putting them in the right order . 
^ he he mobile , and loves talking , and has a good sense of humour , but has become isolated and needs more contact with people . 
^ he needs help with letter writing , form filling etc. , and also would like to go out . 
^ he is particularly interested in architecture nature and flowers . 
^ contact the office for more details . 
^ &num &name 's aid needs more volunteers &name run &num projects working with children from the women 's refuges in &name . 
^ the projects give the mums and kids a break from one another , and the volunteers have an opportunity to get to know the children by sharing some time and exercise with them . 
^ both male and female volunteers are needed to help with the activities outside the refuge , but for obvious reasons only females accompany the children to and from the refuges or help in the craft room . 
^ to join these projects you need to enjoy being with children , have lots of patience and understanding , and have plenty of enthusiasm ! 
^ &name : both distance learning and face to face training are provided 
^ - if any special training is required for befriending a particular child this is , of course , provided . 
^ swimming 
^ once a week our volunteers collect the children from the refuge in the late afternoon and take them swimming ( or splashing ) . 
^ most of the children play in the water rather than swim , but everyone has a great time ! 
^ walking 
^ each week a group of enthusiastic and hardy volunteers accompany children from the refuges to a local park to let them use up their excess energy . 
^ walking , playing footie , feeding the ducks , acrobatics on the climbing frames , throwing frizbees . 
^ it 's often fast and furious , but it is fun ! 
^ craft room 
^ female volunteers go to the refuge in the late afternoon and spend a couple of hours running a craft session once a week . 
^ the refuge has an excellent , well-stocked , craft room , enabling a wide range of activities to take place . 
^ this project is very short of volunteers at the moment - if you 'd like to get involved pleease email &name on &email . 
^ that 's all for this week . 
^ until next time , be healthy , &name
