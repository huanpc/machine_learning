^ dear &name , 
^ " umm , have you not checked your emails today yet , or are you totally and utterly offended with me and so are not talking to me , or are you expecting me to come and see you ? " 
^ - yes , i 've checked my email . 
^ no , i thought i had already made it clear that i 'm not offended with you . 
^ yes , i was kind of expecting you to come and see me since you said yesterday " yes , i will come and see you in your room " . 
^ it would have been greatly appreciated if you had let me know you were not able to come in the near future . 
^ anyway , since that is indeed the case i will reply to your email ... 
^ * no , let 's not leave &name out of this . 
^ it is as much to do with her as it is with you or i and she has been feeling very hurt as a result of the situation . 
^ in any case , she is not well . 
^ at the risk of telling you what to do ; if you have not already done so i suggest you contact her and discuss it . 
^ * i 'm sorry , but i thought you knew the reason for the meal was because of the president 's formal . 
^ i assumed you and &name communicated . 
^ also , not being in &name 's is no excuse for ignorance . 
^ i only found out from my friends , not through any official channels , and as you know all my friends you had the same probability of finding out as i did . 
^ you ca n't argue with logic . 
^ * no one told me you could n't come to the meal . 
^ " it does have to do with honesty , &name , because in the past if you have been upset about something , you have n't said anything . 
^ and you do need to tell me , even if it 's a horribly sarcastic email . 
^ i do n't care if you lose your temper . 
^ yell at me . 
^ that 's what i 'm here for . 
^ sort of ... " 
^ - oh , wo n't coffee tomorrow be fun . 
^ " and remember as well that virtually &num has come to visit me this term - heaven forbid that they should have to walk for &num minutes , or make some kind of effort . " 
^ - oh , sorry , but i 've kind of been occupied elsewhere . 
^ i would be happy to visit you at your house but obviously i 'm not going to walk all the way there only to find you 're not in. it will have to be arranged . 
^ see you tomorrow at &num : &num pm on level &num of the library . 
^ &name
