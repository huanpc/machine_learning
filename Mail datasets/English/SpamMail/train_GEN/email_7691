^ &num ) 5th week ; &name informed people that most colleges should now have received their coffee sachets for 5th week , and that these should be p'holed to all first year students . 
^ &name colleges had had problems with porters telling them off about the mass mailing , or about the posters , but people generally seemed to be getting rid of the sachets . 
^ in other colleges some people had had events on that had good turn-outs and were welcomed by the students . 
^ &num ) getting dark : &name informed people that &name sell attack alarms for &pound; &num from reception , but other colleges have their own schemes for givin &char them out free to their students .

^ the service now can offer more counselling hours than before . 
^ an emphasis had been placed on short-tem counselling ( up to &num sessions ) in the service , but students who required longer-term work would still have the opportunity for that . 
^ &name explained that the &name executive were planning to issue a statement explaining the changes , and she will chase them up on this . 
^ &num ) budgets / taxi scheme : some college welfare officers have budgets , some do n't . 
^ those with budgets tend to use them to buy attack alarms or condoms etc. if you want to do something welfare-y , but do n't have the money , then contact &name , as she may be able to help you out .

^ &num ) &name aids &name : &name and &name gave an update about &name conference and other activities . 
^ details of the conference will be with welfare officers soon to display and encourage students to attend . 
^ &num ) mental health : &name was interested in the support we can give students between being a welfare officer and counselling , and that maybe we could set up a " peer supporters " scheme , or just hold seminars for those interested in supporting their friends and fellow students . 
^ &name will look into the &name scheme and contact &name at &name about seminars etc. &num ) first aid : interested in holding first aid sessions for students ( maybe aimed at sports cubs / captains ) , private companies are expensive and you can no longer train with the cu first aid society for free .
