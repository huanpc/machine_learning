" and " if you get any thinner ,  ame , we wo n't be able to see you at all " . ^ this is their idea of encouragement : they mean well ... ^ to clarify ( just like butter , you know ? ) , i 'm not jealous that  ame has a girlfriend . ^ but just  ame i 'm not jealous of her being with him does n't mean i ca n't be jealous of her ! ^ does that make sense ? ^ i know it 's not a good thing , but see i 'm using it for good ! ^ anyway , how 're you adjusting to life as a graduate ? ^ any more ideas forthcoming ? ^ hope you 're well , ^  ame . ^  miley </text_normal></message_body></message>
