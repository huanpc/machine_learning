^ &name , &name you are well and that kids camp is going / went well . 
^ i am quite surprisingly unbored , despite the fact that i still have no job and &name of my best friends have gone away for the rest of the summer . 
^ i seem to have a lot to do , and even though i 've given my name to countless places ( i do feel like i 've been a bit of a job prostitute ) , &num wants me . 
^ everywhere else in the country seems to want employees , why does n't &name ? 
^ i am becoming increasingly desperate . 
^ i have lost lots of weight since i got to &name ( one of the first things my dad always says to me is " have n't you lost weight ? ! " . 
^ we are a bit obsessed in this house , my mum is stick thin and does lots of exercise , my sister disappears behind lampposts , my dad wants to lose weight [ thats what my mum tells him , anyway ] , and then there 's me ... ) . 
^ so , anyway , i felt that i 'd lost enough to wear a bikini , so little &name and i went bikini shopping , i have a pale blue thing , it is not worth &num quid for that little material , and i think i 'll take it back anyway because when will i ever ever wear a bikini in &name ? ! 
^ it 's not exactly &name , is it ? 
^ so that 's my bikini story , sorry , you 're probably either embarrassed , disgusted or bored , but i have very little else to tell you , due to the dullness of &name and the fact that being boring is genetic ... you should meet my parents ... kidding . 
^ we had the church youth group over for a &name on sunday , they are a noisy , rowdy lot and i escaped to my room with a book . 
^ i am going into &name tomorrow to get some sandals from &name , even though i ca n't afford them . 
^ i am a bit depressed because it looks like i 'll have to get a proper loan next year ( ! ! ! ) , so i am very anti-labour at the moment . 
^ i am actually seriously thinking about going to see my &name ; to protest about tution fees and to give me something to do . 
^ he would be glad to see me , i 'm sure . 
^ it would make a nice change from all those old ladies moaning about water rates , anyway ( not that water rates are n't important at all ) . 
^ my sister 's 18th is soon and she is having a murder mystery party on saturday . 
^ i am novelist and i get to wear a blonde wig . 
^ i have always wanted to be blonde ! 
^ ( to give me an excuse for behaving the way i do , you know ... ) . 
^ what can i give her for her present ( given my present cash flow situation and lack of imagination ) ? 
^ i sat out in the sun today and got a bit sunburnt ; i must go and apply moisturiser . 
^ love &name xx
