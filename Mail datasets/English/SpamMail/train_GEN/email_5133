^ &org-03 call for papers , research notes and &name 
^ 11th conference of the european chapter of the &org 
^ &name , &name , april &num , &num . 
^ &num papers 
^ papers are invited on substantial , original , and unpublished research on all aspects of computational linguistics , including , but not limited to : 
^ pragmatics , discourse , semantics , syntax and the lexicon ; phonetics , phonology and morphology ; interpreting and generating spoken and written language ; linguistic , mathematical and psychological models of language ; language-oriented information retrieval , question answering , summarization and information extraction ; language-oriented machine learning ; corpus-based language modeling ; multi-lingual processing , machine translation and translation aids ; natural language interfaces and dialogue systems ; approaches to coordinating the linguistic with other modalities in multi-media systems ; message and narrative understanding systems ; tools and resources ; evaluation of systems and evaluation methodology 
^ papers on tools and resources for less-studied european and african / &name languages are particularly encouraged . 
^ requirements 
^ papers should describe original work ; they should emphasize completed work rather than intended work , and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results . 
^ wherever appropriate , concrete evaluation results should be included . 
^ a paper accepted for presentation at the &name &name cannot be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available published proceedings . 
^ papers that are being submitted to other conferences or workshops must indicate this on the title page , as must papers that contain significant overlap with previously published work . 
^ reviewing 
^ the reviewing of the papers will be blind . 
^ reviewing will be managed by an international conference program committee consisting of area chairs ( to be announced ) . 
^ each submission will be reviewed by at least &num reviewers . 
^ &name decisions on the technical program will be made by the conference program committee . 
^ submission information 
^ submissions should follow the two-column format of &name proceedings and should not exceed &num ( &smiley pages , including references . 
^ we strongly recommend the use of &name &name style files or &name &name style files available via the conference website , &website format will also be available in case you are unable to use these style files directly . 
^ as reviewing will be blind , the paper should not include the authors " names and affiliations . 
^ furthermore , that reveal the author 's identity , e.g. , " we previously showed ( &name , &num ) ... " , should be avoided . 
^ instead , use citations such as &name previously showed ( &name , &num ) 
^ papers that do not conform to the requirements above are subject to be rejected without review . 
^ &name &name 
^ you must submit a notification of submission by filling out form at a designated website .

^ &num research note and demo sessions 
^ the &org-03 meeting will include research note sessions and demo sessions . 
^ research notes should present work in progress , project status reports , unevaluated results or system summaries ( with or without demos ) . 
^ in the programme of the conference there will be sessions reserved for research notes . 
^ presentations of research notes will be shorter than regular papers " &num . 
^ each research note will be allocated &num pages in the conference proceedings . 
^ we also encourage the submission of software demos related to any areas of computational linguistics . 
^ areas of interest include , but are not limited to : 
^ * natural language processing systems , including &char dialog systems and interfaces &char &name translation systems and translation aids &char message and narrative understanding systems . 
^ &char information retrieval and information extraction systems 
^ * application systems using embedded language technology components 
^ * &name components ( speech recognizers , parsers , generators , ... ) 
^ * software tools for facilitating computational linguistics research 
^ * software for demonstrating or evaluating computational linguistics research 
^ * aids for teaching computational linguistics concepts 
^ demos of tools for less-studied european and african / &name languages are particularly encouraged . 
^ developers should outline the design of their system and provide sufficient details to allow the evaluation of its validity , quality , and relevance to computational linguistics . 
^ pointers to web sites running the demo preview will also be helpful . 
^ research notes and demo submissions will be reviewed by an international panel . 
^ format for &name
