^ ... &name ! 
^ hey guys - hope you 're all well and behaving yourselves ! 
^ &name this is such a huge email list but i thought that the more emails i sent the more replies i might get ( naive i know ) . 
^ i 'm hoping that &num of more of you ( actually hopefully &num or more ! ) of you will be happy to help out in &name &name during &name &name . 
^ apart from it being a cool place to hang out generally , getting a chance to chat with the new freshers and otherwise scoff your &num free ( and absolutely delicious ) &name you will also receive a huge heap of thanks from &name and i and a badge with your name on . 
^ how about that ? ! 
^ if you would like to take up this offer , keep reading , otherwise &name to the end . 
^ in return for this heap of generosity on our part we 're asking that you either hang out for a couple of hours in the kitchen , sit around for &num hours in the &name room or spend a fun evening running back and forth . 
^ alternatively , if you were feeling particularly adventurous , you could volunteer to spend a hour &num morning ( the record is &num min in the shop i think ) making a fun-' packed " trip to &name . 
^ the choice is yours ! 
^ &name &name 's running ( at last reckoning ) on &num nights during &name &name : wednesday ( during / after the ceilidh ) , friday ( instead of planet of sound ! ) and saturday ( ca n't remember ! ) . 
^ i 'd really appreciate some help so it would be great if you could let me know if you 're happy to fill in. 
^ at the &name &name , etc. we 'll be encouraging the freshers to sign up to the &name &name rota , so if you do n't want to be bullied too much this term into volunteering i suggest you let the freshers know how much fun it is . 
^ &smiley service with a smile remember ! 
^ ( except for &name &name and &name - do n't want to scare them ) 
^ &name &name was a real success the last &num terms and we 'd really like to see it continue in this spirit . 
^ partly this is down to the third years . 
^ they need to be encouraged to keep eating ... no seriously , the &name room became a really great place to hang out last year and especially on &name &name nights had a really great , very lively atmosphere . 
^ we 're going to carry on running it on wednesday and saturday nights and we need to get the new freshers into the &name habit . 
^ hook them while they 're young and they 'll be yours for life ... 
^ thanks everyone - &char look forward to hearing from you ! 
^ love &name 
^ &name i know where you live . 
^ &name if anyone sees me this weekend be sure to shout " &name &name ! " at me , which will remind me to think about whether i 've forgotten anything !
