^ further to &name &name " message of 10th august , here are some additional details about moving your computer equipment . 
^ we are assuming that most people will disconnect their own equipment but please ask for help if you are not confident . 
^ if you think you will need help , please make your needs known as soon as you can , and not at 6pm on the day before you move ! 
^ if possible , please shut down systems cleanly before switching off . 
^ &name machines can be shut down from the logon menu . 
^ to shut down &name machines , use alt-ctrl-f1 to switch to the line mode console , then alt-ctrl-del to reboot . 
^ switch off just as the machine is about to reboot . 
^ you should not have to move equipment very far , but take care if you do . 
^ personal safety is paramount and avoiding damage to equipment comes a close second . 
^ large monitors should not be lifted by a single person ; even if you are strong enough to handle the weight they are unwieldy and difficult to lift without back strain . 
^ get a second person to help if you have to move a monitor . 
^ in some areas of the building ( &name , &name infill and parts of &name &num ) the network is still based on thin ethernet . 
^ in these areas individual machines may be connected to converters or minihubs providing &num , &num or &num &name sockets ( square with retaining latch ) . 
^ in such cases you should disconnect the &name cable from the minihub and leave the minihub behind . 
^ these minihubs will not be needed in the new building . 
^ under no circumstances should you disturb the coaxial network cables with &name connectors ( &name , bayonet fixing ) ; if you do you could break the network still being used by people who have not yet moved . 
^ if you have a standard university telephone handset please leave it behind . 
^ new handsets will be provided in the new building . 
^ ( old handsets will be collected later for reuse ) . 
^ if you have a 'special " telephone handset which you want to continue using ( e.g. a speakerphone ) then unplug it and pack it in your crates . 
^ when you get to your new office and your equipment has been unpacked , you should assemble it as far as you can and let us know when you have done so . 
^ if you feel confident about plugging everything together then please do so , but please ask for help if you do not ; the minimum we expect you to do is indicate where you want the equipment sited . 
^ keep cables tidy . 
^ do not connect to the &name sockets in the floor boxes . 
^ in general they will not be made " live " until they are patched through at a wiring closet . 
^ in any case , you cannot tell by looking at it whether a socket is ethernet , telephone or something else . 
^ when you are ready to be reconnected , please let us know . 
^ &num way of doing this is via the secretaries in the reception office . 
^ in addition to this method , i hope to announce shortly a web-based method for requesting the work to be done electronically .
