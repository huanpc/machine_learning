^ the &name could be a good idea , if everyone wanted to do this . 
^ perhaps we should stamp a " &name &num &name &name " at the top of each of our source files though ! 
^ other part &num group projects have done this , particularly those who have gone on to place their projects on sourceforge and other development servers . 
^ i think after so much hard work that we all put in , we should put some indication of our copyright on the files before distributing them , especially if we make them open source as such . 
^ what does everyone else think about this ? 
^ there 's always &name . ... 
^ but our source and binaries are world-wide accessible already , and so i guess with the current setup , it would seem to give implicit permission for anyone to use it

^ hello everyone 
^ i think we should discuss our response to this , since everyone would have to agree about things like copyright etc. &smiley 
^ i.e. i think we should retain our copyright , as a group , to the source code .
