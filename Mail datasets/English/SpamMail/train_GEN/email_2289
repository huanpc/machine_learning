( or fly straight from  ame ... ) if we went somewhere nice that would be good . ^ ( beach ... ) i suppose there is the possibilty of my parents house / cottage in  ame . ^ this would take some persuasion of the parents , but if you want me to try , it would be free and quiet . ^ it wo n't be warm , there 's not much at all to do , it 's not near the beach and it 's  um hours from  ame which is  um hours from  ame , so do the maths from your own houses ! ^ that is some comment . ^ i hope that helps  ame , and the rest of you can feel popular and informed about my life . ^ actually , work is going  ame have been very very busy . ^  ame has tendonitis in his foot so he wo n't be playing any sport or even running upstairs for  um weeks at least . ^ it will be a bit of a problem for a sports team member , but we 'll get by . ^ last week i learnt about buying minibuses and insurance and mots and ohhhh it was exciting , but hopefully we will get the grant we applied for . ^ i would appreciate it if you prayed especially for this girl called  ame . ^ she is having a lot of problems at home , her parents make her stay off school to look after her younger brothers and sisters ! ^ and so she is a long way behind with her standard grades . ^ she is also grounded a lot and so hardly sees her friends . ^ her mum is pregnant with her 7th kid at the moment and so  ame can only guess that things will get harder particularly as they have only have a  um bedroom house . ^ she is going to soul surviour in the summer with a loving aunt . ^ she really wants ot be involved in the church in perth but  ame she is grounded finds it hard . ^  ame studying / work / learning to drive * delete as appropriate is going well for you all love  ame ^  ame your free portable and private address on the net at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
