^ find your way around the command line functionality , so that your &name install works the way you want it to . 
^ you wo n't be an expert overnight , but it will certainly lead you in the right direction .

^ every coin has &num sides . 
^ tuesday , we saw some very positive comments from a reader regarding &name &name . 
^ never let it be said that we do n't offer balanced reporting and reviewing here in penguin &org . 
^ today , we 'll see the downside from a few other readers with firsthand &name &name &num experience . 
^ first up is this note from former fellow &name &name &name : 
^ i have been using &name for about &num years and prior to trying &name &name &num i had been primarily using mandrake and then eventually gentoo . 
^ after all i had heard about &name &name i thought it was about time i checked it out . 
^ while i do not consider myself a novice i am not an overly technical user . 
^ although i do most things from the command line . 
^ in short , i was severely disappointed in &name &num . 
^ in fact after attempting to use it for a couple of weeks i re-installed &name &num on &num box and gentoo &num on another . 
^ i am not sure i could say enough bad about &name . 
^ it had that whole " legacy &name " feeling to me . 
^ far too many things that i felt i had no control over and had to hunt and peck to turn off or disable . 
^ the whole this is the way things should be , because we say so , feeling . 
^ the install is very easy ( i used the &name ) and it recognized most of my hardware fairly easily . 
^ it did fail to accept a second hard disk that was in &name &name saying it needed to be re-formatted no matter what i tried . 
^ but overall it was smooth . 
^ once i booted up though scary things were waiting . 
^ bluecurve is ( &name ) an insidious and scary prospect . 
^ while i respect &name &name 's contributions to gnome it seems to be away from the user being in control and more toward father knows best . 
^ i will gladly give away some dumbing up of the &name for greater freedom . 
^ open office would not work and had to be downloaded and reinstalled . 
^ once i had started from scratch all was fine again . 
^ that is if i could keep my mind focused on my work while the update notify icon was flashing in the lower right hand corner . 
^ after looping through the update procedure and downloading what i wanted i rebooted . 
^ &name , here it goes again . 
^ even though i had downloaded what i wanted , flagged other things as not interested it kept telling me i needed to update . 
^ my mailbox was filled with mails telling me i needed to pay for a membership or fill out the questionnaire , etc. i think this is all unneeded . 
^ i have always purchased the software rather than downloading ( additionally making contributions to &name and &name club ) because i think it is a small price to pay for the hard work they go through to make a good distro but i do not want to be nagged . 
^ is this what it takes for them to survive . 
^ i could go on and on but there is a simple phrase that i think sums up my experience . 
^ it is all too glossy and slick for me . 
^ if i can use and analogy . 
^ the first time i ever went to &name i walked into a casino and looked at all the flash , was given a free drink and free food and my thought was tinstaafl if they can give all this away then the odds in favor of the house must be incredible . 
^ make sure you know what you are buying . 
^ my feeling with &name &name &num was similar . 
^ it is so slick , so packaged and so glossy that i was instantly concerned with what i would be giving up to get all this glitz . 
^ after about a month i knew and the price was way too high . 
^ for others it may be less so and more power to them . 
^ i am eagerly awaiting &name &num and the next release from gentoo . 
^ i ca n't ever imagine trying &name again . 
^ if this is the leader , i will stay in second . 
^ there 's a lot to chew on there . 
^ then , there 's this brief note from frequent frankly commenter , &name : 
^ sorry my thoughts are so late . 
^ i have blogged this several times , and i must say i am still disappointed . 
^ i look at my &name &name disks with sadness , knowing that the distro is less beautiful , less ... attractive , and certainly less recommended than it once was . 
^ i once thought &name &name the best of all the options , more user friendly , moving toward the desktop &name that i want to get my family members into as a &name alternative , now i am telling everyone who uses the distro that they ought to move to something more user appreciative and cost effective , though i am not sure what that is . 
^ mandrake ? 
^ they seem on thin financial ice . 
^ &name ? 
^ it seems popular , but i have a hard time finding a full install &name online . 
^ &name , &name , and a few others are well known , but i am honestly not sure of any of them for * user * friendliness , not just geek friendliness . 
^ maybe some of the readers can put a few cents in here ? 
^ perhaps they already have . 
^ lol . 
^ i am pretty far behind , but this is something that has been on my mind as i move my thoughts to making my old main machine into a solitary &name server / test machine . 
^ there now . 
^ decide for yourself . 
^ meanwhile , back at the little penguin abode in &name , i 'm sitting with a brand-spanking new &name &name sl-5600 at my side . 
^ thanks to the fine efforts of &name &name at &name &name &name ( the &name firm handling the &name reviews for &name ) , the &char arrived this afternoon , just as i was arriving home for lunch . 
^ in fact , i started playing and evaluating immediately after opening the box . 
^ there will be quite a lot to talk about next week when reviewing this latest personal mobile tool from &name . 
^ and i 'll have the whole weekend to gather my thoughts . 
^ on tuesday , we 'll look at the sl-5600 on its own . 
^ on thursday , i 'll clue you in to how it compares to the sl-5500 and other &name in its class . 
^ it should be a fun week . 
^ now , read on and make your way back on tuesday . 
^ see you at &name , &name &name 
^ gnometweak 
^ &name &name &name 
^ today 's gnometweak is a little trick with &name upon which i 've become very , very dependent . 
^ it 's a way to perform custom searches from the address bar on nearly any search engine . 
^ the tweak is made possible by &name 's bookmark keyword function . 
^ this feature allows you to assign shortcuts to your bookmarks . 
^ if , for example , you visit &name regularly , you can assign your slashdot bookmark the shortcut slash or sd . 
^ you can then access the slashdot site by typing slash or sd in the address bar . 
^ it 's considerably quicker than pulling down the bookmarks menu and searching through until the slashdot bookmark is found . 
^ to utilize this feature for an existing bookmark , select manage bookmarks from the &name menu . 
^ right-click on the bookmark you 'd like to shortcut and select properties . 
^ assign your keyword in the keyword text box , then close the window . 
^ hope your new shortcut by typing it into the address bar and pressing the &name key . 
^ to make this shortcut work with a search engine is nearly as easy . 
^ first , visit &name and perform a search . 
^ i 'm using penguin &org in this example . 
^ &name the results page . 
^ select bookmarks / manage bookmarks as before . 
^ find the page you just bookmarked , right click and select properties . 
^ in the location text box , you 'll see this line : 
^ &website 
^ the key element of the search is the string that immediately follows the " &char " : &name . 
^ strip out &name and replace it with %s . 
^ this instructs &name to pass your search string to &name . 
^ now , add your shortcut ( gg , for example ) to the keywords field , and save the customization by selecting ok . 
^ let 's test the tweak . 
^ enter the following in the address bar : 
^ your-google-keyword &name 
^ you 'll be automagically transported to &name , displaying the results of your search . 
^ i use one of these custom search keywords nearly daily . 
^ gg for general &name , gl for &name &name , rss for feedster , fm for freshmeat , and sd for &name . 
^ it will , in fact , work for most sites that utilize a search capability , though not all will follow the exact regimen of &name . 
^ &name , for instance , returns a string like this : 
^ &website 
^ in this case , you 'll replace pirillo with the %s characters . 
^ the best way to understand how a particular site works is to simply look for your own search string in the return results in the address bar , then replace your string with %s . 
^ saving effort , &num keystroke at a time ... 
^ recommend it !

^ get your favorite &name flavor on &name : pick your favorite &name flavor and get it on &name for as low as $ &num . 
^ find &name gear , books , and software for &name at &name &name . 
^ check out the selection today ! 
^ setting the path 
^ the path in &name is largely unnoticed - until you try to launch a program using only a command and find that it does n't work . 
^ this can be fairly common in &name distros . 
^ programs in the /usr / sbin directory , for example , are generally not in the path . 
^ today 's &num will help you lessen the keystrokes necessary to launch your &name programs . 
^ if you 've come to the &name world from &name , you 're already familiar with the path concept . 
^ the concept is the same in either &name . 
^ setting a directory in path allows you execute the program without the full path name . 
^ your system looks first to path , reading through all the listed path names , looking for one that contains the command you 've issued . 
^ if the program is n't in a listed directory , you 'll get an error message stating that the command was n't found . 
^ these are programs that require the full path name . 
^ there are &num ways to add a directory to your path . 
^ the first is a 'session only " addition . 
^ from within a console window , enter the following command : 
^ export path / path / to / file 
^ this temporarily adds the new path to the current session . 
^ in other words , closing the console window will throw out the exported path . 
^ there is a more permanent solution , created by modifying a single file on your system . 
^ .bash_profile contains your user path . 
^ do n't forget the ( . ) in the file name - it 's there specifically to hide the file from normal ls directory listings . 
^ from your /home / user directory , open the .bash_profile file in your favorite text editor . 
^ cd /home / &name &name .bash_profile 
^ within this file , you 'll find a line similar to this &num : 
^ path $ path: $ home / bin 
^ this is where you 'll add the new directory . 
^ simply append this path addition to the line , separated by a colon : 
^ path $ path: $ home / bin:/usr / sbin 
^ in the .bash_profile file , every directory in the path is listed in this line , separated by a colon . 
^ once you 've made the addition , save the file , close the editor and close your current session . 
^ the next time you open a console window , programs in the /usr / sbin directory will be executed without benefit of the full path name . 
^ there are hundreds of ways in &name to save a few keystrokes - important if you 're a die-hard keyboard user . 
^ while adding directories to your path should be used with due caution , it can save an abundance of keystrokes . 
^ recommend it ! 
^ send us a gnomecore tip 
^ &name 
^ &name &name for &name 
^ &website / 
^ the &name &name for &name is a spot-on knockoff of the &name version . 
^ it features nearly all of the functionality of the original within the same look and feel . 
^ features include a unified preferences window , multi-language , file transfers , group support , and event sounds . 
^ the &name &name for &name should satisfy even the most hardcore &name &name user . 
^ recommend it ! 
^ send us a gnomefile suggestion 
^ &name 
^ &name scribbled by &name &name 
^ " your article on upgrading xfree86 to &num just reminded me of one of my pet hates about &name . 
^ when you install a new operating system , the graphical setup routines of all the major distributions can successfully detect and configure the &name installation . 
^ however , when you try to do this using the &name configure command , or the xf86configurator , or xf86cfg for that matter , they invariably fail to detect hardware , and you end up with a broken installation . 
^ in the worst case ( as happened to me recently ) , you end up having to reinstall . 
^ i wasted the best part of a day trying different parameters in the &name configuration utilities , and then just &num hours doing a complete re-install . 
^ " there must be an easier way . 
^ if the installer can detect the hardware , why ca n't &name ? 
^ is there a way of running the same tool that the installer uses to probe the hardware , to get a working installation , _after_ the installation has taken place ? 
^ " i thought this might make an interesting topic , and , if the answer to the above questions is affirmative , a vital piece of time- and sanity-saving knowledge . "

^ preview of the &name &num &name &name 
^ &website 
^ today 's gnomeclick is a web-exclusive review of the &name &num enterprise-class server , available only on &name &name . 
^ a sample : 
^ why are we so jazzed about this box ? 
^ &name and &name have managed to fit twin &name processors , up to &num &name of &name ( yes , &num gigabytes ) , an &name &name disk system with &num drive bays , a cd-rom drive , a floppy drive , twin &name &name ports , and an integrated systems management card ( think web-based &name insight manager on steroids , running its own dedicated &name embedded &name machine ) all in a &name rackmount machine . 
^ and the thing practically makes no noise and gives off no heat whatsoever . 
^ ( try that with an &name &num or a &name configuration , folks . 
^ you 'll be lucky to fit that in &name or &name , and you 'll probably be able to cook your breakfast on the casing . ) 
^ it 's a thorough review of a bleeding-edge server , slated for release today .
