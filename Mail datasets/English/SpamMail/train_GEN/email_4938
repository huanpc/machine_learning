^ hi professor &name , 
^ &name and i have been emailing back and forth today discussing whether stream id is really necessary . 
^ it seems that if restream is moved inside the aggregate boxes , and case statements done using map without the restream afterwards , why keep stream id ? 
^ we will still have the problem of concatenating attributes / keeping history inside the aggreagate boxes , but at least the problem becomes local to the aggregate boxes and is not system wide .
