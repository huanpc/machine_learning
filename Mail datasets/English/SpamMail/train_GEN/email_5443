^ unlike traditional models , current research on idioms agrees the relation between an idiom ? 
^ &char linguistic form and its meaning is often not entirely arbitrary . 
^ for most idioms , word and idiom meanings interact in different and interesting ways allowing the speaker to create new forms and meanings , as in ( 1)- ( &num ) . 
^ ( &num ) i think his father must have pulled a few political strings to get him out of jail 
^ ( &num ) the most important thing is that we leave no legal stone unturned 
^ ( &num ) start / keep the ball rolling ( &num ) &name / defend tooth and nail 
^ ( &num ) &name there . 
^ now you are barking up the right tree ! 
^ ( &num ) he absolutely hates me so if it is true he has found out about my affair , he must be now in my house pouring the beans to my wife . 
^ ( &num ) &char : i think you should be a bit less critical . 
^ try to put yourself in her shoes . 
^ &char : i was in her shoes and came out of them ( &smiley &char : i am really angry you did not help me to get the job &char : you have no idea how many strings i had to pull for you a : well , you did not pull them hard enough ! 
^ this talk provides an pragmatic ( relevance-theoretic ) account of how hearers process and understand idiom strings that enjoy different degrees of analysability and flexibility . 
^ it will be claimed that the output of decoding the concepts encoded by an idiom is not immediately taken as a constituent of the speaker ? 
^ i thought . 
^ instead , the concepts encoded by the idiom constituent words ( e.g. pull , few , political , strings in ( &num ) ) and the concept encoded by the idiom as a whole ( e.g. [ pull [ strings]] * ) merely give access to a range of assumptions in memory which are considered by the hearer in their order of accessibility to construct the meaning the speaker intended . 
^ pragmatic adjustment of word and idiom meaning takes place until the hearer arrives at a conceptual representation ( e.g. [ pull * [ a few political strings * ]] * which when processed in context allows the derivation of enough cognitive effects to satisfy the hearer ? 
^ &char expectations of relevance . 
^ it is because word and idiom meanings work together under strong pragmatic rules to construct the intended interpretation , that this model can account for how these meanings interact in the flow of discourse . 
^ i propose then that far from being dead metaphors , idioms have kept much of their metaphorical flavour and , swimming between the literal and the metaphorical , between convention and creativity , they continue to enrich our language and colour our everyday speech .
