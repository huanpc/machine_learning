^ sort-of &name . 
^ i 've actually still got a pretty full schedule - i 've begun 
^ revising for my exams which are in less than a month 's time now . 
^ &name 
^ is i really do n't like revising , so it is a bit of a struggle , but the bright side is that i probably wo n't have to do it again after this ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ well the current run of fair weather in &name is continuing - we even had &num gloriously sunny days over the weekend !

^ &name birthday , raises some pretty uncomfortableissues for me,- not how can i be &num and well on my way to being bald - i not worried about that . 
^ more to do with the difficulty i seem to have in relating to people ( especially but not only girls ) . 
^ i know relationships are hard work , but i 'm disappointed by the number of people i 've managed to stay 
^ in touch with . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i hear you . 
^ there are no easy answers to these questions are there ? 
^ i remember us talking a while ago about how sometimes it seems like all you 
^ have to hang on to are &name and his promises . 
^ i think things will get better for you &name , as long as you 're willing to keep learning and growing , and also to face the painful things you 're going through without 
^ running from them . 
^ anyway , back to revision for me ... 
^ all best , &name
