^ hi guys , 
^ thank you very much for leading our college &name studies . 
^ just a couple of things : 
^ if you have n't already signed a &name ( doctrinal basis ) this term , could you sign &num and return it to karuna or me . 
^ i know you 've all signed them before but they need to be re-signed at the start of the new exec / rep year so that the file of them is kept up-to-date . 
^ also , we were planning to have a slightly longer slot for prayer at the end of &name studies this week . 
^ we 'd aim to have 40-45mins &name and &num praying . 
^ we thought breaking up into &num or &num , praying for some personal applications of the passage , and also for non-christian friends . 
^ please let us know if you have any other suggestions / comments . 
^ &name and &name
