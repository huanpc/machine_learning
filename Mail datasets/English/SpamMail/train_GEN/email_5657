^ natural language and information processing group seminar &website / 
^ &name : automatic indexing and retrieval of crime-scene photographs : havin &char 
^ recourse to natural language processing 
^ speaker : &name &name - &name university 
^ &num noon , tuesday 3rd december , room &name 
^ &org , &name &name building , &name &name avenue &website 
^ &name : 
^ current approaches in automatic text-based image indexing fail in capturi ng 
^ semantic information expressed in the captions , that is important for the 
^ subsequent retrieval of the images . 
^ the indexing and retrieval prototype 
^ developed within the scene of crime information system ( socis ) project 
^ attempts to go beyond keyword-based approaches and methods that extract 
^ syntactic relations from captions . 
^ socis relies on advanced natural langu age 
^ processing techniques in order to extract relational facts from captions . 
^ these relational facts consist of a pragmatic relation '' and the entiti es 
^ this relation connects ( triples of the form : arg1- &name &name ) . 
^ in socis , the 
^ triples are used as complex image indexing terms ; however , the extraction 
^ mechanism is used not only for indexing purposes but also for image retri eval . 
^ extracting the corresponding relational structures from free-natural &name uage 
^ queries , socis attempts to match the query triples to the indexing triple &char and 
^ retrieve the appropriate images with high precision and recall . 
^ we have 
^ implemented this approach for crime investigation , an application domain where 
^ efficient querying of large crime-scene photograph databases is of crucia &char 
^ importance . 
^ in this presentation , i will start with a demonstration of the current so &name 
^ prototype and an overview of the application scenario and i will then foc us on 
^ the &name techniques used for developing the prototype . 
^ the main extraction 
^ mechanism will be presented , as well as a preliminary retrieval mechanism ( the 
^ " query triples - indexing triples " matching mechanism ) . 
^ ( all welcome - for instructions on how to get to the &org , 
^ please see : &website )
