^ hi , &num downloaded your software . 
^ &num question ... i am using it for a &website file alone , it does n't change the icon on the start menu . 
^ if i also change the main .exe file , it does . 
^ however , if i then try to open the program , it says " this application requires shockwave player &num , which is not installed . 
^ click ok to download it " . 
^ do you know why this would happen ? 
^ it worked fine before i tried to change the icon . 
^ thanks , &name
