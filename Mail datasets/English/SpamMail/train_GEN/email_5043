^ i just left a copy of &name and webelhuth on your desk , if you 're goin &char to 
^ write a paper for &name , you should be sure to cite this ( and &name and &name 
^ of course ) . 
^ suggested outline : 
^ &num productivity of some verb particle classes . 
^ do n't just use the standa rd egs 
^ - use examples from cide that are n't in &name . 
^ discuss the fact that the verb particles extracted from a corpus are n't all listed , similarly &name &num not in dictionaries . 
^ &num give general lexical rule , point out could be used productively ( also 
^ mention redundancy rules ) 
^ &num point out that intuitively verb particles seem to cluster , &name &name &char &char 
^ aspectual particles etc etc. also point out that , intuitively , you get 
^ intersections with verbs tending to co-occur with the same set of particl es . 
^ &num version of &name rule for aspectual verb-particles ( point out hierarchy of 
^ &name rules is possible ) 
^ &num but - &name classes do n't work , exceptions to , some 
^ expected particles do n't occur . 
^ &num therefore . 
^ &name &name and &name &num ( lexical 
^ rules ) , &name ( &num ) - semigenerative lexicon paper 
^ ( ~&website ) and say this is another piece &char &char 
^ evidence that we 're right ! 
^ end of paper ...
