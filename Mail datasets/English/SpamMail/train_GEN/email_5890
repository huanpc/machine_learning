^ &name public static boolean &name ( &name &char ) perform a probabilistic primality test to determine if &char is prime . 
^ this method returns true if &char is probable prime and false if it is definitely composite . 
^ the probability of returning true if &char is composite is fixed at &num for this implementation . 
^ this bound is a reasonable choice for most cryptographic operations . 
^ this method can be used as drop-in replacement for the biginteger.isprobableprime ( ) method offering much better performance . 
^ this is achieved by first filtering out number divisable by small primes and then using the &name test with tighter bounds . 
^ this method only works for positive numbers .
