^ i have your email address from the &name literature sec . 
^ as being someone who bought &num copies of " a fresh start " by &name &name at &name . 
^ the &name event comittee has been trying to order copies to give to people who " pray the prayer " at the end of the talks , or who ask for more information about christianity . 
^ however , there has been a problem with the order and we wo n't get the in time . 
^ therefore , we were wandering whether we could " borrow " any copies that you have n't given away and are in good condition . 
^ we would then get a new copy to you when the order comes through . 
^ if you can help us with this , please bring your copies to &name this saturday . 
^ we will put out a box , but you must make sure that you give us your name , college , email address and number of copies you 're giving so we can get them back to you . 
^ it would also be useful if you could let me know so that i know how many copies to expect . 
^ so please reply to this email if you can help . 
^ alternatively , if you wo n't be at &name you could p' hole me , &name &name at &name " . 
^ many thanks - keep praying for your friends " eyes to be opened to the truth of the gospel in &name &name
