^ it is illegal " for a grammar to unify &num relations 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes . 
^ composition can only involve accumulation of relations via ( the equivalent of ) append . 
^ generation wo n't work if this is n't obeyed , and the semantic composition algebra also assumes it ( i.e. , &name &num paper ) . 
^ but a more philosophical discussion will have to wait ... 
^ although this restriction apparently rules out a &name analysis for &name / &char combination , this is n't completely true , since the information could be refactored to get the same effect . 
^ ( although i do n't think that analysis is tenable for computational grammars anyway ... ) if there 's another class of cases where someone would like to merge relations , i 'd be interested to hear about it .
