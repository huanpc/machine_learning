^ i am developing an archiver and i wonder what &char shall do to to use &name in it as &name and &name does ? 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ the language i am using is c++ ( &name c++ builder &num ) . 
^ i do n't have an url yet because the archiver is not totaly complete . 
^ i will contact you when it is . 
</text_embedded>

^ did i get back to you on this ? 
^ i ca n't remember . 
^ sorry if i did n't. 
^ the easiest thing to do is to use the attached &name module as c++ builder can quite happily use &name modules ( the &name of &name &name is written in c++ builder and has some c++ and some &name modules ) . 
^ the attached code is exactly the same as is used in &name and &name , so it has been tried and tested . 
^ simply call run&name when the user selects " create a self-extracting archive " . 
^ if it returns true , then &name &name has been successfully run and you can leave all the work to &name &name . 
^ alternatively , if it returns false , you should use your own internal &name creation utility ( if any ) or show a dialog telling the user where they can get &name &name from . 
^ do n't forget to send me a link and image & banner to link to you from the &name &name website !
