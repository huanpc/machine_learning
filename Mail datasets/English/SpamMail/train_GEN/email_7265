^ thanks for the email . 
^ it 's a real shame to hear that they ca n't come anymore . 
^ i 'd be happy to take part if something similar happens in the future .

^ thank you all for agreeing to help out with the &name 's formal . 
^ i 'm really sorry to mess you about , but i 've just been informed that they are no longer coming here on the 29th , so it 's no longer necessary for us to book in. it should be fairly easy for you to cancel - i 'm not sure whether you can do this at the &name machine , or whether you need to see &name , but in either case it should be easy and you should be refunded the full amount . 
^ i 'm very sorry about this !
