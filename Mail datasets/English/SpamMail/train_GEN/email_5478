^ hi all 
^ you have received this email because ( we think ! ) you expressed an interest in joining the european theatre group 's winter tour of &name &name as a technician . 
^ if this is not the case , or you are no longer interested , then apologies - this is a one-time email and you have not been added to any lists . 
^ but ... if you are interested in touring &name this december , then read on ! 
^ the european theatre group will be presenting &name &name this christmas , from &num to &num december . 
^ we will tour up to &num venues in &num countries across &name , as we have done for nearly &num years . 
^ we are looking for &num fresher technicians to complete our touring company - no previous theatre experience is needed . 
^ we will be holding interviews next weekend to help us select these roles . 
^ the interviews will be very informal - we 're not going to quiz you on your knowledge of obscure theatrical equipment , or whether you can ask the way to the lighting box in french ( or even whether you 've ever been in a lighting box before ) - we just want to find out a bit more about you , and to give you a chance to find out more about us . 
^ there will be one of our touring team present - &name , our lighting designer , &name , our stage manager , and myself , and interviews will last about &num minutes . 
^ we 're planning to hold interviews on the afternoons of saturday &num and sunday &num october . 
^ so , if you think you 'd like to join us on tour , please drop me an email by wednesday evening letting me know your name , college , and any of the times above when you are n't available . 
^ if you ca n't make either saturday or sunday do n't worry - let me know and i will arrange an alternative time . 
^ if you want any more information about the tour , then please drop me an email or take a look at our website : &website 
^ thanks , 
^ &name &name technical director , &name
