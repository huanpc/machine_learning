^ &name ! ! ! 
^ hi , i 'm well . 
^ " am i bored ? 
^ well , probably not , although i 'm rather lazy . 
^ i 've not done as much chemistry as i could have . 
^ no , i most certainly am not revising my quantum mechanics ! 
^ ( yet ! ) that would make me disillusioned for the entire holiday . 
^ so , you 're in a new house ! 
^ well , anything is bound to be 'relatively tiny after &num rooms ! 
^ yes , i hope your room will be alright too . 
^ when you ask me to say hi to " everyone , to whom are you referring ? 
^ by the way , i 've just finished watching " voyager on the television . 
^ did you see it ? 
^ if you did , then i 'll just say that living with you if you had passed warp &num would n't be very different than reality just kidding ! 
^ so , what are you up too ? 
^ are you sharing a bedroom in your new house ? 
^ how is &name ? 
^ &name is in good health , thanks to your restorative makeover on saturday . 
^ are your nails still that " hideous shade of colour ? 
^ well , &name , i was wondering if you had any pictures of yourself which you could e-mail me . 
^ you see , i 'm looking for one of you with a condescending gaze , and also &num where you have your hands raised up , expounding some theory or suchlike . 
^ can you help ? 
^ well , i hope you 're " keeping moving on . 
^ &name feels very isolated up here . 
^ tell me , does it feel isolated living in the deep south , where most other people live ? 
^ i have trouble imagining that it can ! 
^ have you heard from anyone else whom i know yet ? 
^ well , i 'm trying to study as much as i can psychologically cope with , but i 'm going to be working in my dad 's bookshop tomorrow and friday this week . 
^ that should give me a welcome break from the hallowed halls of chemistry . 
^ i 'm going to be spending the new year up in the scottish highlands &name , and may possibly be going skiing . 
^ last time i skied i fell over . 
^ i was about &num . 
^ i did n't much care for it and have never been back since . 
^ i hope i do n't fall down this time as it would be infinitely more embarrassing ! 
^ anyway , i am also looking forward to going on the internet much more as we are changing our &name to one which provides a totally free service ntl . 
^ tell me , does &name have netscape instant messenger service ? 
^ &name is thinking of downloading it . 
^ ( she has such a mind of her own ! ) i hope you and your family are all well in your new home . 
^ i 'm really looking forward to receiving your amusing e-mail ! 
^ &name 
^ &name i tilt my head slightly and to the side , and smile in a benign manner whilst half-closing my eyes .
