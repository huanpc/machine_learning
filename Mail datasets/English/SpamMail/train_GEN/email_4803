^ hi ms. &name , 
^ i called up the &name hotel to ask them to fax some proof that i stayed there . 
^ they said that the system was down for now , but they would fax this information over later today . 
^ the reason why i think i will need this as well is that i used my father 's credit card to pay for the hotel because i was afraid i would go over my credit allowance using my credit card ... so the credit card bill will have my father 's name on it . 
^ i have attached the printer-friendly version of the credit card bill with this email ( the date of payment is &name 27th ) ... hopefully this with the &name proof plus the &name receipt ( that i will reattach with this email which has my name on it ) will be enough . 
^ sorry for the delay in response ... i have just had exams this week so things have been a little stressful .

^ &name , 
^ accounting is asking for proof of payment for your double tree stay . 
^ if you paid using a credit card you can submit your statement . 
^ if you choose to do this , cross out the card number before you send it to me . 
^ you can fax this ( &num ) &num or send it snail mail : &num &name &name # &num , &name ca &num .
