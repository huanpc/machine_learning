"  um  ame stared at him in fear . ^ " what is it ,  ame ? " he asked . ^ the angel answered , " your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before  ame . ^  um now send men to  ame to bring back a man named  ame who is called  ame . ^  um he is staying with  ame the  ame , whose house is by the sea . "  um when the angel who spoke to him had gone ,  ame called one of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants . ^  um he told them everything that had happened and sent them to  ame . ^  um about noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city ,  ame went up on the roof to pray . ^  um he became hungry and wanted something to eat , and while the meal was being prepared , he fell into a trance . ^  um he saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its  um corners . ^  um it contained all kinds of four-footed animals , as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air . ^  um then a voice told him , " get up ,  ame . ^  ame and eat . "  um 'surely not ,  ame ! "  ame replied . ^ " i have never eaten anything impure or unclean . "  um the voice spoke to him a second time , 'do not call anything impure that  ame has made clean . "  um this happened  um times , and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven . ^  um while  ame was wondering about the meaning of the vision , the men sent by  ame found out where  ame 's house was and stopped at the gate . ^  um they called out , asking if  ame who was known as  ame was staying there . ^  um while  ame was still thinking about the vision , the  ame said to him ,  ame ,  um [  um ] men are looking for you . ^  um so get up and go downstairs . ^ do not hesitate to go with them , for  um have sent them . "  um  ame went down and said to the men , " i 'm the one you 're looking for . ^ why have you come ? "  um the men replied , " we have come from  ame the  ame . ^ he is a righteous and god-fearing man , who is respected by all the jewish people . ^  har holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say . "  um then  ame invited the men into the house to be his guests . ^ the next day  ame started out with them , and some of the brothers from  ame went along . ^  um the following day he arrived in  ame . ^  ame was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends . ^  um as  ame entered the house ,  ame met him and fell at his feet in reverence . ^  um but  ame made him get up . ^ 'stand up , " he said , " i am only a man myself . "  um talking with him ,  ame went inside and found a large gathering of people . ^  um he said to them : " you are well aware that it is against our law for a jew to associate with a  ame or visit him . ^ but  ame has shown me that i should not call any man impure or unclean . ^  um so when i was sent for , i came without raising any objection . ^ may i ask why you sent for me ? "  um  ame answered : "  um days ago i was in my house praying at this hour , at  um in the afternoon . ^ suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me  um and said ,  ame ,  ame has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor . ^  um  ame to  ame for  ame who is called  ame . ^ he is a guest in the home of  ame the  ame , who lives by the sea . "  um so i sent for you immediately , and it was good of you to come . ^ now we are all here in the presence of  ame to listen to everything the  ame has commanded you to tell us . "  um then  ame began to speak : " i now realize how true it is that  ame does not show favoritism  um but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right . ^  um you know the message  ame sent to the people of  ame , telling the good news of peace through  ame  ame , who is  ame of all . ^  um you know what has happened throughout  ame , beginning in  ame after the baptism that  ame preached--  um how  ame anointed  ame of  ame with the  ame  ame and power , and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil , because  ame was with him . ^  um " we are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the jews and in  ame . ^ they killed him by hanging him on a tree ,  um but  ame raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen . ^  um he was not seen by all the people , but by witnesses whom  ame had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead . ^  um he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the  um whom  ame appointed as judge of the living and the dead . ^  um all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name . "  um while  ame was still speaking these words , the  ame  ame came on all who heard the message . ^  um the circumcised believers who had come with  ame were astonished that the gift of the  ame  ame had been poured out even on the gentiles . ^  um for they heard them speaking in tongues [  um ] and praising  ame . ^ then  ame said ,  um " can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water ? ^ they have received the  ame  ame just as we have . "  um so he ordered that they be baptized in the name of  ame  ame . ^ then they asked  ame to stay with them for a few days . ^  ame  um ^  um the apostles and the brothers throughout  ame heard that the gentiles also had received the word of  ame . ^  um so when  ame went up to  ame , the circumcised believers criticized him  um and said , " you went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them . "  um  ame began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened :  um " i was in the city of  ame praying , and in a trance i saw a vision . ^ i saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its  um corners , and it came down to where i was . ^  um i looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth , wild beasts , reptiles , and birds of the air . ^  um then i heard a voice telling me , get up ,  ame . ^  ame and eat . "  um " i replied , surely not ,  ame ! ^ nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth . "  um " the voice spoke from heaven a second time , do not call anything impure that  ame has made clean . "  um this happened  um times , and then it was all pulled up to heaven again . ^  um "  ame then  um men who had been sent to me from  ame stopped at the house where i was staying . ^  um the  ame told me to have no hesitation about going with them . ^ these  um brothers also went with me , and we entered the man 's house . ^  um he told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say , send to  ame for  ame who is called  ame . ^  um he will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved . "  um " as i began to speak , the  ame  ame came on them as he had come on us at the beginning . ^  um then i remembered what the  ame had said :  ame baptized with [  um ] water , but you will be baptized with the  ame  ame . "  um so if  ame gave them the same gift as he gave us , who believed in the  ame  ame  ame , who was i to think that i could oppose  ame ? "  um when they heard this , they had no further objections and praised  ame , saying , 'so then ,  ame has granted even the gentiles repentance unto life . " ^  um [  um ]  um early manuscript  um ; other manuscripts do not have the number . ^  um [  um ] or other languages ^  um [  um ] or in ^  ame  um ^  um  um years later i went up again to  ame , this time with  ame . ^ i took  ame along also . ^  um i went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that i preach among the gentiles . ^ but i did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders , for fear that i was running or had run my race in vain . ^  um yet not even  ame , who was with me , was compelled to be circumcised , even though he was a greek . ^  um [ this matter arose ] because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in  ame  ame and to make us slaves . ^  um we did not give in to them for a moment , so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you . ^  um as for those who seemed to be important--whatever they were makes no difference to me ;  ame does not judge by external appearance--those men added nothing to my message . ^  um on the contrary , they saw that i had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the gentiles, [  um ] just as  ame had been to the jews. [  um ]  um for  ame , who was at work in the ministry of  ame as an apostle to the jews , was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the gentiles . ^  um  ame ,  ame [  um ] and  ame , those reputed to be pillars , gave me and  ame the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me . ^ they agreed that we should go to the gentiles , and they to the jews . ^  um all they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor , the very thing i was eager to do . ^  um when  ame came to  ame , i opposed him to his face , because he was clearly in the wrong . ^  um before certain men came from  ame , he used to eat with the gentiles . ^ but when they arrived , he began to draw back and separate himself from the gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group . ^  um the other jews joined him in his hypocrisy , so that by their hypocrisy even  ame was led astray . ^  um when i saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel , i said to  ame in front of them all , " you are a jew , yet you live like a  ame and not like a jew . ^ how is it , then , that you force gentiles to follow jewish customs ? ^  um " we who are jews by birth and not  ame sinners "  um know that a man is not justified by observing the law , but by faith in  ame  ame . ^ so we , too , have put our faith in  ame  ame that we may be justified by faith in  ame and not by observing the law , because by observing the law no one will be justified . ^  um " if , while we seek to be justified in  ame , it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners , does that mean that  ame promotes sin ? ^ absolutely not ! ^  um if i rebuild what i destroyed , i prove that i am a lawbreaker . ^  um for through the law i died to the law so that i might live for  ame . ^  um i have been crucified with  ame and  um no longer live , but  ame lives in me . ^ the life i live in the body , i live by faith in the  ame of  ame , who loved me and gave himself for me . ^  um i do not set aside the grace of  ame , for if righteousness could be gained through the law ,  ame died for nothing!'
