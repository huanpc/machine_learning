^ having read the invitation &num points strike me : 
^ &num ) there is substantial prize money at stake . 
^ as well as money for coming in the first &num places there is also &num euros to be gained for each win a player achieves . 
^ accommodation is free and there is a small amount towards travel . 
^ so we need to be open about the criteria used to select the &name representative as the invitation has potentially a lot of value to the recipient . 
^ &num ) the number of places given to &name players is dependent on how well our strong players do at the european &name . 
^ hence if none of our strong players went to the european then the &name would not get any places . 
^ ( the russians have &num places and the germans &num places because of their good results at the top level ) . 
^ this suggests to me that we should bias our selection towards a strong &name player who regularly ( or occasionally ) competes in the european &name ( at his own expense ) . 
^ it 's good for &name go to have strong players competing in european competitions and we could use this as a reward for that . 
^ so maybe you could draw up a list of those &name &num dans and above who have played in a european &name in the last &num years . 
^ and then rank them in some way - by &name grading list or by actual results in said european congresses with a weighting towards the more recent attendance . 
^ of course , we could then be open to accusations of it being unfair on very poor &name players who cannot afford to play in the european . 
^ that is a separate issue that maybe council should address at some time - as to how very worthy cases might be assisted to complete at the european &name if money is the problem . 
^ but i am not sure that we have that problem amongst our &num dans and above at present . 
^ also , those &name players who never compete in &name have other chances of trips abroad such as to the world amateur . 
^ &name 
^ all , 
^ received the following which requires us to nominate &num &name representative &name or above to this event . 
^ i have already given the requested acknowledgement of the message . 
^ i 'm not aware that we 've identified a method of selecting our representative to this event . 
^ if not , we need to pretty quickly now . 
^ i hope to see &name on friday and learn from him how frequently we 'll be allowed to nominate how many people . 
^ meanwhile , please get thinking about how we should do this .
