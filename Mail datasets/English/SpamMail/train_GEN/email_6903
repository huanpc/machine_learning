^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : &name &name for &name explorer ( &num ) released : &num december &num &name : &num december &num ( version &num ) &name : &name ( &char ) &name explorer impact : allow an attacker to execute commands on a user 's system . 
^ &name &name : critical bulletin : ms02-068 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletins at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ reason for &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d this is an updated bulletin describing a cumulative patch for &name explorer &num and &num . 
^ the original patch released on december &num , &num is unchanged . 
^ however since releasing the patch , &name has received a report suggesting that the vulnerability addressed by this bulletin could be exploited to run arbitrary code on a user 's machine . 
^ &name investigated that report , and was able to develop a demonstration that exploits the vulnerability to run arbitrary code . 
^ we have released this updated bulletin to advise customers of our new assessment of the potential impact of the vulnerability , and of its updated severity rating . 
^ &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d this is an updated bulletin describing a cumulative patch for &name explorer &num and &num . 
^ the original patch is unchanged and , in addition to including the functionality of all previously released patches for &name explorer &num and &num , eliminates one additional flaw in &name explorer 's cross-domain security model . 
^ this flaw occurs because the security checks that &name explorer carries out when particular object caching techniques are used in web pages are incomplete . 
^ this could have the effect of allowing an attacker to execute commands on a user 's system . 
^ exploiting the vulnerability could enable an attacker to invoke an executable that was already present on the local system . 
^ it could also allow an attacker to load a malicious executable onto a user 's system , or to pass parameters to an executable . 
^ however , a registry key setting discussed in &name knowledge base article &num disables shortcuts in &name help , which significantly reduces the scope of this vulnerability as it removes the ability to load a malicious executable on a user 's system or to pass parameters to an executable . 
^ an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a web page that uses a cached programming technique , and could then either host it on a web site or send it to a user via email . 
^ in the case of the web-based attack vector the page could be automatically opened when a user visited the site . 
^ in the case of the &name mail- based attack vector , the page could be opened when the recipient opened the mail or viewed it using the preview pane . 
^ on december &num , &num , &name released the original version of this bulletin . 
^ subsequent to that time , &name received a report suggesting that the vulnerability addressed by this bulletin could be exploited to run arbitrary code on a user 's machine . 
^ &name investigated that report , and was able to develop a demonstration that exploits the vulnerability to run arbitrary code . 
^ we have released this updated bulletin to advise customers of our new assessment of the potential impact of the vulnerability , and of its updated severity rating . 
^ the original patch released with this bulletin was and is effective in preventing exploitation of the vulnerability . 
^ it is also effective in eliminating all vulnerabilities addressed by prior bulletins that could allow a malicious party to run code on the machine of a user who visited a hostile web site or opened a malicious &name email message . 
^ &name strongly urges all customers to install the patch . 
^ mitigating factors : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d 
^ - &name explorer &num is not affected by this vulnerability . 
^ - -the web-based attack scenario would provide no way for the attacker to force users to visit the site . 
^ instead , the attacker would need to lure them there , typically by getting them to click on a link that would take them to the attacker 's site . 
^ - -the &name mail-based attack scenario would be blocked by &name &name &num and outlook &num in their default configurations , and by outlook &num and &num if used in conjunction with the outlook email &name &name . 
^ - if the steps described in &name knowledge base article &num have been taken to restrict shortcuts in &name help , then the following mitigating factors apply : 
^ - the vulnerability would allow an attacker to read but not add , delete or modify files on the user 's local system . 
^ - the attacker would need to know the name and location of any file on the system to successfully invoke it . 
^ if invoked , there would be no way for an attacker to pass parameters to that executable . 
^ - the vulnerability would not provide any way for an attacker to put a program of their choice onto another user 's system .
