^ my problem with you design is it is more or less a widget to choose a templ ate than anything else . 
^ a startup dialog is something i see each time i launch &name , it should n't get in my way and give me the options i use the most so that in &num or &num clic ks i can start working . 
^ if you watch how a " non geek " user works with its wordprocessor , you 'll see 
^ that he uses it for &num or &num different tasks e.g : write a letter , a paper , a memo etc. .. these tasks can change from user to user . 
^ but having t he possibility to choose the labels template in a startup dialog , a template i 
^ use once every &num years or a fax template when i do n't even have a fax machine on my computer is not very elegant and very confusing for a beginne r. that is why i think the startup menu should &name be task oriented with the 
^ possibility of configuring the tasks to adapt for each user . 
^ you must also understand that for 'dummies " the &name is the only application that they will master and that they wo n't use the best tool for 
^ each little job . 
^ for example , i 've found that one of my best friends who is a heavy user of &name on &name when he needs to copy a file to a floppy will open it in &name and do save as .. on the floppy . 
^ he does n't know how to us &char the &name and he does n't need it . 
^ i think &name &name should adapt to this ki nd of users ( and therefore have a good way to choose , search and organize your 
^ word documents ) but i know you disagree with me on this point . 
^ but i agree that we should n't embed kfind . 
^ i 've just tried to us it and it is still so slow and clumsy compared to grep :-( &name &name 's &name is the future with it 's google-like interface and 
^ looks much nicer : &website
