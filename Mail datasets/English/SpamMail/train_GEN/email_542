^ dear &name , 
^ hello ! 
^ it was nice to talk to you last night . 
^ i hope you did n't mind me going , but i was very very tired as i had been up since &num : &num a.m. 
^ as you know , i arrived back from &name camp yesterday . 
^ &num intense week of abseiling , go-karting , mountain biking , sport , activities , bible study , prayer , music and meetings . 
^ oh , and yes , there were &num &num and &num year olds as well . 
^ children say the most curious things . 
^ i think my &num favourites from this week were " are we allowed to get the dinner plates dirty when we eat ? " and 'do you have to sign a form to become a christian ? " joking aside though , i enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . 
^ consequently i enjoyed a much more respectable &num or &num hours sleep each night . 
^ ( well , most nights . ) &name importantly , one of the children made a commitment to &name , which was wonderful . 
^ this afternoon i 've been with my family to &name - a nearby country house . 
^ it is very warm today and i like it . 
^ we had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . 
^ tomorrow morning i begin my new job for &num weeks . 
^ i will be working from &num o' clock until &num in the lab , and i am quite looking forward to it although i hope it will not be too boring . 
^ sorry i never sent you a postcard , but i did n't really get a chance to buy one . 
^ do you mind ? 
^ anyway , i think the one you sent me more than made up for my lack of imagination . 
^ well , what are you doing for the remainder of the holidays ? 
^ are you still being a caretaker ? 
^ do email soon . 
^ very best wishes , 
^ &name
