^ hi 
^ these are the most recent council minutes . 
^ as i was unable to attend &name &name kindly attended on my behalf and took the following notes : 
^ report from college council meeting on april 30th , &num 
^ &num ) benefactions a former &name student ( an elderly lady now ) was impressed by some articles written by the admissions tutor and published in the daily telegraph . 
^ thus she felt obliged to donate &num million to the college . 
^ &num ) &name &num new fellows were admitted to college , and &num books published from the sino-indian project , which is supported by college . 
^ &num ) scholarships / prizes college monitored its contribution to &name &name trust ( includes european trust and &name awards ) . 
^ so far college contributed &name &num , &num to the trust . 
^ in return &num students were supported . 
^ ) double check with &name why contribution still worthwhile 
^ &num ) college estates college used to own &num houses in &name road which it sold last year since they were deemed unsuitable for student occupation . 
^ one is back on the market for a lower price than originally sold . 
^ for the other &num , a loft conversion , for which permission was asked by the current owners , was agreed . 
^ &num ) college treasures the &name museum asked again for permission to reproduce some of the college 's treasures : an illustrated medieval manuscript , the image &name by &name ( shows the tree of consanguinity ) in addition recipes from an antique cookbook were requested from college . 
^ the archivist had to assure council that the cookbook was indeed in the archive and not currently used by the kitchen . 
^ the archivist also emphasised that he would not be happy to be obliged to cook the recipes he forwards . 
^ &num ) graduate representation college council formally agreed to the proposal to have graduate representation on all college committees on which students are represented . 
^ this happened upon demands of the former &name committee and the &name wing of &name by virtue of misrepresentation of &name interests by the last &name president . 
^ since the graduates can air their needs and concerns directly rather than via &name officers , the impact will be much greater . 
^ &num ) for prospective alumni college was asked to grant permission to have &name painted in watercolours as all old &name colleges will be . 
^ this was already done with the old &name colleges . 
^ the master , bursar and dr &name were not at all impressed by the quality of the paintings , but did not dare to refuse permission as the &num and only college in &name . 
^ however , council agreed not to promote the sale of these paintings to alumni . 
^ they also choose a painter that seemed to be a lesser evil and hoped that he was still alive . 
^ regards 
^ &name
