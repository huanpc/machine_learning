^ hi &name ! 
^ thank you very much for your offer to swap rooms with me on a temporary basis . 
^ i hope you are aware , that it might take until next term that the college has found a suitable room room for me . 
^ in addition , my room-although it is nice and very quiet- is probably quite small compared to yours . 
^ i 'll pop round this afternoon to see what the carpet is like . 
^ thank you very much again , &name

^ hi 
^ i 've been thinking about what you were saying on thursday about your room & your dust allergy and was wondering if you wanted to do a temporary room swap with me until college can find a more permanant room allocation for you ? 
^ i 've got a good-sized , first-floor , inwards facing &name &name room ( y7 ) which might be better for you . 
^ i do n't know what the carpet in here is like for dust - you 'd have to evaluate that for yourself . 
^ i should be in tomorrow afternoon if you want to pop round .
