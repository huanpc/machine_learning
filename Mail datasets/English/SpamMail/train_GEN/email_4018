^ i had just written you a longish e-mail asking you to check the date , but i think that it is becoming clear that this summer in &name would probably be impractical . 
^ over the last day or so , i 've heard that my close friends are in the process of organising a week away together , as &num last " thing " as a group before we all go our own ways ... and so it would not be great to miss that . 
^ also , even if i missed this , i think with my possible start date nearing the start of july , this might not be the best for the group of leaders to have someone new coming in so late .

^ thanks for the quick reply , &name . 
^ yes , i suspect july would be coming in to the program a little too late . 
^ and in your situation , i think i would have a hard time passing up on the week away with good friends !

^ grrr. i really was looking forward to that ! 
^ just spending the summer serving &name and the kids , and getting trained up too . 
^ sigh ! 
^ thanks for all the leg work you 've done &name , i really appreciate it .

^ not much leg work here - just a small amount of finger work , and very happy to do it - only sorry i did n't get this to you earlier to give you a little more time to chew on the idea . 
^ am sure you will be a great asset to those you 're with whatever you choose to do this summer !
