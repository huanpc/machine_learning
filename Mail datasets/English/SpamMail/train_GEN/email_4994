^ hi &name , 
^ there is no official &name meeting tomorrow or monday . 
^ well , that is to asy that there is no meeting of the whole group . 
^ christian ( our fulltime staff person - i think you know him ) is holding a developers meeting tomorow at some point . 
^ you could ask him when that was ( &email ) . 
^ i do n't know how interesting that would be to you , but you are more than welcome to attend . 
^ i 'll be around tomorrow . 
^ my schedule is a little scattered . 
^ we have a faculty candidate around and i have &num student exams from roughly &num or &num : &num tomorrow afternoon . 
^ we could meet in the &num timeframe or after &num : &num . 
^ i will probably be around on monday , but there is bit of uncertainty . 
^ i 'd give it an &num . 
^ tomorrow would be a sure thing as long as you do n't mind my scheduling constraints . 
^ it will be good to see you .

^ hi &name , 
^ i am in &name , back from visiting the other &num &name programs , and would like to come down to visit &name at some time over the next few days . 
^ ideally , this would occur on a day in which there is an &name meeting , so that i could attend that as well , and then maybe talk to you before or afterwards . 
^ i was wondering if you knew whether an &name meeting was scheduled for tomorrow or monday ( &name said the one for today was postponed ) , and if not , whether either of those &num days you would be available to chat if i came down to &name . 
^ anyway , i hope all is well . 
^ i should be hearing from &name relatively soon , so i 'll let you know about that as soon as i hear .
