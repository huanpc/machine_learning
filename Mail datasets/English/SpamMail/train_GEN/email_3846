^ &name &name ! 
^ sorry i have n't been in touch , it 's just been the usual start of term faffing period . 
^ i 've been having a reasonably exciting term with lots of rowing and some racing and stuff . 
^ it 's also quite nice only having &num modules to work on ! 
^ it was lovely and sunny this morning after the snow last night and the river looked really pretty ; i went sculling with &name &name and we were the only people on the river . 
^ this was a good thing since i have n't really got the hang of steering yet ! 
^ it took me about &num times to get onto the landing stage which had &name doubled up laughing but i managed to get out all on my own ! 
^ it 's all very exciting , although not for all the people who i subject to my enthusing ... 
^ i went to the termly afternoon tea at the &name yesterday . 
^ say what you like but i enjoy them and i like &name . 
^ he is cool . 
^ &name is so funny and i think i might have been a little sarcastic yesterday but it 's so hard to resist ... i sat next to a first year guy also called &name ( there are &num of them ! ) who spent all afternoon insulting me . 
^ either that or flirting , its so hard to tell . 
^ oh dear . 
^ speaking of flirting , i 'm trying so hard not to develop a crush on one of the guys i know right now . 
^ i 'm trying to tell myself , no &name &char ) there 's no point , he wo n't like you &char ) the last thing you need is a distraction right now and &char ) you barely know him and do n't have much of a chance to get to know him so give up . 
^ please email back soon sending messages of sanity and tell me how to stop turning into a &num year old ! 
^ he walked into dinner the other day and my friends at the table had to ask me why i was smiling inanely at my plate ! 
^ i 've only spoken to him properly &num times ! 
^ help ! 
^ i have n't told anyone here ( apart from &name &name of course , you 've got to do something for her to mother you about at least once a week ) but i guess it 's safe to tell you all those millions of miles away ! 
^ life is good at the moment . 
^ i 've only recently started to get back on track with &name since the disaster that was last year but i finally feel like i 've got a reason to live again and am looking forward to learning a lot this term . 
^ i went to &name church yesterday which ( if you can ignore people being overly emotional ) was really good , especially the teaching which surprised me . 
^ i still have n't really settled into a church yet though . 
^ i 've got plenty of time still because ( did i tell you this ? ) i 'm applying for a masters here in engineering geology . 
^ i 've got a whole &num year plan ( which &name is , of course , free to disrupt at will but it 's good for me to have something to work for personally ) . 
^ next year will be spent getting this msc which may or may not lead to a career in engineering . 
^ after that i 'll take a year off and spend some of it working and some of it ( hopefully and &name willing ) in &name with the volcano observatory doing a project for them in geodesy . 
^ if i like that then there 's a phd at &name under &name &name ( 'disaster &name " who incidentally was one of &name &name 's students ) that i would really like to get , about the hazards and predictions of basaltic volcanism . 
^ and by then i 'll be &num and feel like i need a proper job ... 
^ the idea of ever being &num is a frightening one . 
^ how are your plans for the future going ? 
^ do write soon if you have time , i 'm off to read about the &name &name , 
^ &name mapping of lava flows 
^ &name .
