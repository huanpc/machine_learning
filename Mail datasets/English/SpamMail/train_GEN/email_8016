^ &name
^ sorry for taking ages to reply to your email , no excuse other than my terrible memory ! 
^ will be great to see you and &name on friday night , it doesnt matter if he cant get there till later , i shouldnt think many will turn up till &num ish anyway . 
^ i 'm still working in &name at the &name , doing a work placement at the &name channel , is fun and great experience but im sick of not being paid . 
^ am moving back to &name on the 2nd of &name , into a nice little house about &num mins away from the station so dead handy . 
^ will be living with &num girls and a guy , all teachers and they seem like a nice bunch . 
^ guess you never know for sure though till you get there ! 
^ rehearsals havent started yet thank goodness &name im in enough trouble as it is for not being back at the start of term ! 
^ i 'll have to do a stint helping to run the auditions but luckily they are this weekend so &name be there already . 
^ you 're doing an msc right ? 
^ are you still living at &name ? 
^ it 'll be weird to come back there as a non-student , ca n't decide if i miss the lifestyle or not , certainly dont miss the essays but the morning lie-ins did compensate ... 
^ anyway , better stop waffling and get on with some work . 
^ looking forward to seeing you &name , 
^ love 
^ &name xx

^ thanks so much for the invitation ! 
^ it was a really nice surprise . 
^ so where are you living now ? 
^ oh , i just realised i have n't actually said that , yes , me and &name would like to come on the 18th . 
^ well , &name says he 'll probably be able to come ( ~95% probability ) but there 's a chance he would n't be able to make it for bang on &num , if that 's okay ... ? 
^ so have you got a job sorted out in &name ? 
^ and have rehearsals started already ? 
^ how 's everything going ? 
^ too many questions !
