^ &name . 
^ my name is &name &name . 
^ my sister is getting married on the 20th july . 
^ i suppose prayers for smooth running and good weather would be appreciated , plus a good witness to our many non-christian relatives . 
^ i am leading on our church youth group houseparty from 27th july - 3rd aug. i 'm not quite sure what this will entail , but i think it will be mainly organisation of games , the music for the meetings , and looking after a dormitory of boys , including preparing some devotional thingies . 
^ i am going on holiday with my parents during august , which could be really nice or incredibly boring . 
^ pray for the former . 
^ bye bye . 
^ &name . 
^ hi all ! 
^ hope you 're all enjoying the glorious weather and making the most of may week ! 
^ with the long vac ahead and &num &num / &num months of not seeing all our friends , it 's really important that we do n't stop praying for each other over this time . 
^ to help us in this , i shall be compiling an &name prayer diary for the long vac however , i ca n't do this without information from you ! 
^ please let me know 
^ &num your name - helps me make sure i 've included everyone 
^ &num what you are doing over the summer - whether you are going to the &name to do a beach mission or working in an office job in &name , let me know so that we can pray for you in that place 
^ &num when you are doing things - it makes it easier to know when to pray for you if we know when you are doing what 
^ &num particular prayer points - anything you want us to pray for in particular ; anything at all 
^ &num anything else you feel like adding ... 
^ please let me have all this by the end of wednesday .
