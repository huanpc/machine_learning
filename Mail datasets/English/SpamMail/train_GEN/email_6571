^ &name &name &name , next to the &name &name on &char &char &name avenue , has been refurbished as a meeting space and prayer room for those working on or near the &name &name site . 
^ i am writing to tell you about the facilities available , and to invite you to join an email list for further mailings . 
^ please respond to &name &name &email if you would like to join the list . 
^ the steering group is keen that the building should be an amenity available to anyone on site , not just for religious and spiritual purposes . 
^ at present it is open to visitors from &num to &num on tuesdays and thursdays , and from &num to &num on fridays . 
^ you are welcome to bring your own food to eat in the coffee lounge and make yourself a drink in the kitchen . 
^ the prayer room is in daily use for muslim prayers . 
^ please contact &name &name , &email for details . 
^ in addition , there are christian prayers at &num on tuesdays and &num on fridays . 
^ if you would like to use the &name room ( capacity about &num ) , please let me know . 
^ this would be a good space for a small group not restricted to &num particular department . 
^ &num smaller rooms are available for private study and confidential conversations . 
^ as one of the university 's deans and chaplains group and a chaplain to people at work in the university of &name , i am happy to talk and listen to anyone who feels it may be helpful , about any concern . 
^ you can make an appointment by email , or drop in when the building is open on tuesdays and fridays . 
^ ( although i shall be there on thursdays , i shall be teaching from &num to &num . ) 
^ with all best wishes 
^ &name &name chaplain at the university church
