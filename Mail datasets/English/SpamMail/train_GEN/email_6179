^ hi , changing font settings for &name can get boring , after a while , and being able to load one of a few presets would be nice . 
^ i have just started to program a small change to the control center module to add the ability to save a " font schema " in a way similar to what is available under the color module . 
^ so far , i played with the &name , i am going to implement the real stuff soon . 
^ a snapshot of what the dialog will look like is at 
^ &website 
^ i 'd appreciate some feedback . 
^ thank you , &name kde-usability mailing list &email
