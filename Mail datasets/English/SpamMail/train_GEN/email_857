^ dear &name , 
^ hello . 
^ what was children 's camp like ? 
^ were you the subject of adoration for multiple teenage girls this time ? 
^ hope you enjoyed it . 
^ are you still living in &name ? 
^ i 've had thursday and friday off work since the harvest has been slow in starting and there was literally nothing for me to do - all painting and tidying completed . 
^ therefore i 've been spending my time doing some chemistry . 
^ last weekend i spend a lovely few days at &name 's house . 
^ she ate &num slices of pizza on monday lunchtime at pizza hut and felt rather ill afterwards . 
^ dear , oh dear . 
^ i consumed a much more respectable &num . 
^ after eating &num once with &name i decided not to attempt a repeat performance . 
^ yesterday morning i went for a walk on the beach which we all went to when the flat came to visit &name . 
^ it was gloriously sunny and most enjoyable , although i could n't see any remains from our forbidden campfire . 
^ bye , 
^ &name
