^ just a quickie ... 
^ heard from &name - who says " thanks for the prayers . " 
^ he 's heaps better , but do keep him in your prayers : " i really am enjoying being back at work and busy . 
^ &name is still playing up , and the virus being related to glandular fever is still making me unbelievably tired , but i really ca n't complain . 
^ life is fab ! " 
^ and a little request from me : i have not been sleeping at all well ... especially on wednesday night when i barely slept ! 
^ it was pretty horrible . 
^ so since then i am catching up but not as much as i 'd like to ... so prayers would be appreciated as i feel pretty horrible and miserably today . 
^ thanks guys
