at  ame all day , not just because those running value support , but because the varsity match is a simply unique experience . ^ i still cite my last varsity match of  um years ago as being the best race of my life , but the thing i remember most about it is not my own position , but the fact that our team placed  um ,  um ,  um ,  um ,  um and  um in the race . ^ what made that race special was not just that i ran harder than i 'd ever run before , but that every other member of the team did too , and it was because of that that we won . ^ that year  ame won all  um men 's races , and i want to see you do it again this year . ^ believe me , there would be few things that feel worse than crossing the line on saturday , as  ame cheer , victorious , knowing that you could have run better . ^ cross-country races can often feel like you 're running for nobody but yourself , but  ame is different . ^ you have been selected to run for a team , and victory , when it comes , will be as much for that team as for you individually . ^ try and go to your team social , think about how the race will feel , know how you are going to run it , and then go out there and do it . ^ i wish i was able to run it with you . ^ make sure that you earn your place , ^  ame ^ there is only  um race there is only  um enemy there is only  um victor <text_embedded> ^ as a former  ame captain i thought i would get the ball rolling with some words of encouragement for everyone involed with the events of this coming weekend . ^ as everybody on this list will either be running on saturday or coming to support the club in our quest to defeat the auld enemy , consider this directed at you . ^ of all the hype that surrounds the build up to the varsity matches , there is  um message that you need to understand : ^ every single runner will count to our overall victory ^ i am sure that anyone who has ran a few cross-country races has at times , found themselves running around a race , wondering why they are doing it and knowing that if they lose or gain a place or  um nobody else will really care or even notice . ^ 2-5ths is very different to this . ^ every place that every runner gains will not only matter , but it wil be crucial . ^ even if you are the 8th man / 6th lady in the team , if you can get ahead of the last  ame scorer , that will make an equal effect to the final team result as the person who manages to move up from 2nd to win the race . ^ the  um unique aspect of the race is that you are not running for yourself , you are running for every other member of your team . ^ furthermore , you are running for the pride and honour of  ame university  ame and hounds , as every single place will be added up at the end of the day to decide who wins the varsity challenge trophy . ^ you can do no more training . ^ all our preparation is complete . ^ all you can do is give everything you have on saturday . ^ we have all ran the  ame course and this will give us an advantage . ^ however , when i stood at the finish of cuppers , i did not see a single person collapse as they crossed the line exhausted . ^ there was no vomit or blood spilt through the effort of the race . ^ if we are to be successful on saturday , this will have to change . ^ everybody will have to run the race of their life . ^  ame will come here arrogant and confident after they won the challange trophy last year . ^ they will want to win again . ^ we must want to win even more . ^ the key factor will be team spirit . ^ you must want to run faster not for yourself , but to ensure you do not let your team mates down . ^ make sure you attend pre-varsity strides on thursday and make it to you team socials in the evening and then let the  ame roar carry you round the race . ^ that way , celebrating victory on saturday evening will be even sweeter . ^ finally , this weekend will be a great sporting occasion . ^ what makes it great is the camaraderie and competitiveness of those who take part . ^ for many , participation in and the winning of a varsity match is the pinnacle of thier sporting achievement . ^  ame or lose though , it will certainly be a day you never forget , so make sure you take time to enjoy it . ^ may the force be with you ^  ame ^  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame :  um  um  ame :  um  um you are on the  ame mailing list either because you are
