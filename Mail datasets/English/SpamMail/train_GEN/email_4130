^ &name , 
^ congrats on your brother and his commitment and all , tell him " well done " ! 
^ as for the virus , yeh , it would have come from me and by now you would be getting loads of messages saying 'mail delivery failed : returning message to sender " . 
^ if you have any of those type emails then i would go get an antivirus program . 
^ if not , you probably do n't have what i had . 
^ nevertheless , it is worth protecting yourself for the future ( and i 'm not talking about safe sex if you hear what i mean ... ) . 
^ anyway , thanks for the epic about your summer adventures . 
^ i write this from &name , i 've been here a few days and i start my course on monday and i 'm playing for &name city 2's on saturday so i 'm pretty happy . 
^ and thanks again for the &name &name contact details as i 've already met up with him and it was good to do so . 
^ cheers then , &name 
^ &name , what signs should i look for for this virus ? 
^ i got an e-mail from someone from college , i ca n't remember who now though , &num few days back , and i did n't like the look of it , so i deleted it . 
^ would the virus have come from you ? 
^ hope you are well , 
^ &name 
^ guys , 
^ &name news i 'm afraid . 
^ i have been a victim of goodness knows what types of viruses but also and rather annoyingly , i have been a victim of an email worm type thing . 
^ basically , if you do n't know , a virus type thing has been sending itself to everyone in my address book and obviously i got it from someone who had me in their address book and so forth . 
^ anyway , i 've been trying to fix this for about &num days or so and have finally now managed . 
^ the answer is pretty simple - go get the most up to date antivirus program available . 
^ so if you 've had problems with your computer and you were unprepared ( like me ) then i would recommend &name &name &num as it 's done the job for me . 
^ alternatively you could try downloading a free evaluate version from the web , i tried but it ( not surprisingly ) did n't work ... 
^ anyway , apologise again and i hope it was sifted out by your email providers . 
^ otherwise , i hope you 're all well !
