^ hey &name &name ! ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name , my old friend , you are a star ! 
^ - well , y' know , i do my best ( ! ! ) 
^ i would love to see &name again , so feel free to invite her alone . 
^ invite her for lunch and supper if you like . 
^ she does n't need a bed , right , as i 'm assuming that she still lives in &name ? 
^ if she does , we can find one . 
^ - thanks ! 
^ she wo n't need a bed , you 're right . 
^ i talked to her last night and told her what you 've said , and she 's really pleased and will no doubt be joining us on the saturday ! 
^ i 'm pleased that you talked with &name , as i got the impression before that you &num were not as close as , say , &name and yourself . 
^ is &name starting her a-levels or finishing them ? 
^ - she 's started her 2nd yr of a-levels . 
^ last year she did as " , and this year turns them into a-levels ( it 's this stupid new idea of new labour ! ) and , yes , you 're right . 
^ &name and i have not been very close , but i really think talking to her the other night has helped me understand her so much better and has brought us closer together . 
^ my little brother &name has just started secondary school , and i am sooooooooooooooooooooooooo glad that i 'm not going there anymore . 
^ i was reading the guide about dress , and school lunches , and the like ... &name ! 
^ it makes me shudder just to think of it . 
^ - oh , i know the feeling . 
^ i was looking through &name 's school magazine and recalling school times that i 'm well glad are over ! ! 
^ &name is so much better , even if exam results are not too good ( i did pretty pants in the exams , if you 'd not heard ) . 
^ i 'm really looking forward to seeing you again . 
^ it has been a long , long time . 
^ - likewise , my friend ! 
^ tell me please , how is &name ? 
^ - well , where do i start ? 
^ there are so many stories flying round at present that i 'm not sure what to believe , and i think he feels the same way . 
^ when i was up in &name a month or so ago , he was in for treatment and on one of our visits into hospital &name and i were told by one of the doctors that a scan he 'd had showed that the tumour had practically all gone . 
^ this was very exciting , but we 've since heard from other doctors and specialists who 've examined him that " a substantial part remains " and other stuff . 
^ i just wish they 'd just give clear and consise answers instead of &num that seem to conflict etc , but then it can hardly be an easy job for them , and they 're doing their best . 
^ hmmm. ... well . 
^ anyway , &name has had &num chemotherapy sessions now , and that 's it for the moment . 
^ a week on monday they will start him on &num weeks of daily radiotherapy sessions that they hope will zap whatever remains and get rid of it for good . 
^ this process has been described in conflicting ways too . 
^ &num person described it as 'relatively simple " while another said that it would be an " extremely difficult " process with unclear results . 
^ oh man ! ! 
^ &name is , it seems that the little bit that is left is extremely close to &name " spinal chord , so radiotherapy treatment will have to be carefully carried out so as not to permenantly damage it . 
^ but , despite all these complications etc , &name , and we , remain hopeful that the radiotherapy will be a success and will be the end of his treatment . 
^ he may need a session of chemo following the radio just to make sure that nothing starts to grow back again , and then hopefully that will be the &name of this whole business - a business that 's had a profound effect upon so many people 's lives , and i count myself as one of those people .

^ &name , now to let you know about my train tickets . 
^ the only train i could get on friday 14th arrives in &name at &num ( lunchtime ) . 
^ i do n't know if any of the others will have arrived by then or if you 'll be free to meet me , but if not i 'm quite happy to amuse myself for the afternoon . 
^ as for coming home , i 'm planning on going to &name 's house sometime on sunday ( probably after lunch ) and stay at hers for the night before travelling back home on monday morning . 
^ well , gotta go and have lunch . 
^ hope you have a nice weekend and continue to enjoy your story-writing ! 
^ bye for now , love &name
