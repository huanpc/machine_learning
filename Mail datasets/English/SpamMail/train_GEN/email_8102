^ &name &name &name , 
^ meant to phone you friday , then saturday to find out if i 've got the right stuff , but did n't get round to it till it was too late , so thought i 'd better e-mail you instead so that i can get something posted to you on monday . 
^ i found a couple of things in your work pile but i 'm not sure what all i 've got . 
^ do you need anything on relational database theory or functional dependencies+ normal forms ? 
^ on reflection i 'd better spik ti ye on the fone as there appears to be notes , questions and answers all mixed together . 
^ i 've found &num questions and the answers to &num of them and another &num or &num answers to which there are no question papers , so i 'll maybe have another look through your wardrobe when i get up tomorrow to see if i can find anything else . 
^ anyway pity about the &name getting beat today i think thats the end of their slender chance of retaining the league gone now . 
^ have to go , will spik to you later on today or tonight to get your stuff sorted out . 
^ lots of love and kisses , 
^ &name
