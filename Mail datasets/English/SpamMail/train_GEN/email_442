^ dear &name , 
^ hi ! 
^ did you have a good time at " &name &name " ? 
^ did you do anything interesting ? 
^ thanks for your e-mail , which i received whilst on holiday . 
^ i had a lovely holiday in &name &name , did not see any irish mice , and sent you a postcard . 
^ incidentally , i know i wrote in my postcard that the &name isle had no foot and mouth , and i 'd just like to make it clear that the postcard was written before the current outbreaks . 
^ &name 's mum is 'secretly worried that &name might be a drug dealer . " 
^ what do you think of &name 's well-thought-out cottage idea ? 
^ well , " we could make it very cheap " ( is she hinting at a subsidy here ? ) and " we could invite loads of people " ( delightful ) and " or somewhere " ( as usual , an excellent grasp of specifics ) somehow sound interesting . 
^ so , about &num people are descending on a very cheap cottage for a week - how delightful . 
^ a lovely idea ; it might even work . 
^ i have been revising organic chemistry for a week ( this is the first time in my life i 've studied the topic , which is about a third of my degree , and i 'm pleased to say i am enjoying it and it is rather interesting ! ) . 
^ i have also been moping over the demise of &name and the ascendancy of &name . 
^ oh dear , change again . 
^ &name really ought to have tried harder . 
^ the mass populace ( &name ) thinks she 's old and past-it . 
^ &name seems to have all the appeal these days . 
^ well , today i had a lazy morning as i was tired from &num hours travelling yesterday - we did n't get home until &name last night . 
^ i then did a small amount of studying this afternoon . 
^ i am shortly going outside ( it 's very windy weather , but otherwise pleasant ) to build a step up to our house . 
^ i will be using cement for the first time in my life ! 
^ would you like to chat online sometime ? 
^ &name and i may be doing so this evening at &name , although i have n't heard from him , so it 's doubtful . 
^ whenever is convenient , send me an e-mail . 
^ i 'm looking forward to seeing you soon , 
^ &name 
^ &name when are you going back up to &name ?
