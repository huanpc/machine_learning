^ just a thought on problem submissions . 
^ could we try and make sure the submission indicates whether the computer in use is a pc or a &name ? 
^ this is fairly critical as it usually changes the suggested remedial action - not to mention alters wildly my abilities to solve the problem ( whist i can beat windows into submission most times , i 've never used a &name before , and trying to solve someone 's problem is n't the best place to learn ! ) . 
^ just thought i 'd suggest it as it 'd probably make all our lives easier to know what we 're dealing with beforehand . 
^ &name .
