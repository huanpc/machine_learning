^ i 'm actually going home this weekend ( mum 's 50th ) , so wo n't be at &name morning or evening . 
^ my schedule 's not too full really , juts trying to fit in work around everything else &smiley let 's see ... here are the times i should usually be free ( some sups i don' [ &char yet know about ) 
^ mon : &num , &num , &num ... 
^ &name : any time except i may have &name some time between &num and &num not evening wed : before &num , possibly &num ( as on &name ) , after 8.30ish &name : before &num &name : before &num ( but depends on &name ) sat : probably wo n't be going to &name / &name until june so any time &name : do n't usually have anything except &name and phoning home some time in the afternoon ...

^ hi 
^ how are you ? 
^ been a long time since i last saw you , what with &name harvest and going home etc. &name the exams and project went well . 
^ it might be nice to meet up sometime to catch up & discuss long term mission stuff , as briefly discussed before . 
^ i do n't know how free your schedule is , so let me know anyway . 
^ i wo n't be at risky living tomorrow ( i decided not to take up the small group leadership or the taskforce for risky living in favour of doing cums this term and reconsidering which i 'll do next term over the summer ) , but should be at church on sunday morning . 
^ not sure this is making sense ... it 's getting late & i should probably go to bed , so if you ca n't make sense of this let me know & i 'll try again when i 'm not falling asleep &smiley 
^ take care 
^ love
