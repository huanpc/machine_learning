^ &name and the &name gang , 
^ thanks for letting us know that we are a bunch of pigs . 
^ it is , in my mind , unfair that either the bedders or " the committee " has to always clean up after these parties . 
^ there will , however , always be some amount of mess to clear up . 
^ therefore , may i suggest a sign-up ( perhaps via a pre-party email call-out ) for volunteers to clean up the morning after ? 
^ my impression is that us non-committee &name members do appreciate what is done for us , and i think most of us would be more than willing to help out . 
^ in future i would definitely be happy to help . 
^ let me know what you think .

^ dear &name 
^ due to the state of the &name after last guest night please be aware of the following : 
^ - the powers that be in the college were extremely unimpressed with the mess in the &name on wednesday morning . 
^ this will not help our case for the redecoration of the &name . 
^ - the bedders do not clear up after &name &name . 
^ this means that it comes down to the people on the committee . 
^ we spend a considerable amount of time organising things for the &name , and do not appreciate having to clear up after you on top of what we already do . 
^ please try and keep the mess to a minimum . 
^ thanks &name
