^ hi guys . 
^ &num requests really ... some of you will have heard about my friend dawn , whose neighbours were causing problems . 
^ things eased off but she 's worried they might start up again - so keep her and her family in your prayers . 
^ secondly , i have had the survey back from my house , and it 's not as good as we 'd hoped ... it should be ok , but it 's a bit stressworthy and i have to make some scary decisions . 
^ pray that &name would give me wisdom . 
^ i received this in my email today which was a comfort to me - so i thought i 'd pass it on ! 
^ " there is no situation so chaotic that &name cannot from that situation create something that is surpassingly good . 
^ he did it at the creation . 
^ he did it at the cross . 
^ he is doing it today . " 
^ -- &name &name &name 
^ hope you 're all ok ! 
^ loads of love and bigs hugs to you all , love you lots , &name bless &name xxxxx
