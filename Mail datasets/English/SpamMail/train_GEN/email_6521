^ &name &name 's summer plans : i will be going to &name , god-willing , for the whole of july with om . 
^ we will be seeking to bring the good news to those who have n't heard or responded out there , in various ways such as bible distribution , friendship evangelism and , i expect , a lot of prayer . 
^ after that i will be at home on the isle of &name for most of the time , probably having a job for a while and reading a bit in preparation for next year 's part &num maths . 
^ please pray that &name would be speaking to me as i do these various things and that i would grow in him as i respond to whatever he says . 
^ i tend to see the summer as a time of relaxation but also preparation for the future , so pray that it will be a helpful break . 
^ also i would value prayer that whatever contact i have with my non-christian friends at home would be fruitful , and that i can encourage the christians at my home church in some way . 
^ &name bless , &name &smiley
