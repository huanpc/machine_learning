^ oops , sorry - i thought that was one of the times you said you could make . 
^ i 'm ok for later on on friday , or alternatively on a different day , as you want . 
^ &name & i do n't have exams this week , though there are obviously revision supervisions & &name may have further commitments that i do n't know about . 
^ i suggest that you propose a time which is best for you , fitting around our exams & then we can confirm it .
