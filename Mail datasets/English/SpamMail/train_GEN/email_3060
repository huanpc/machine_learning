) to anything else , ie seeing someone in light of being a marriagable item . ^ people who are good friends can be terrible lovers ( could n't think of another word , you know what i mean ) , and so i think that " going out " ( how i hate that term ) , in a serious ,  ame , learning about each other and  ame , kind of a relationship , can be the right way to go . ^  ame , how far to go . ^ i honestly do n't know . ^ in theory , i 'd go with thw whole kissing and holding hands and nothing else brigade , but i do feel a complete hypocrite saying that , given that my past purity record is not particularly fantastic . ^ i think that to engage emotionally is to engage physically , and that the stuff i mentioned above is a legitimate expression of the emotional commitment you do have when you are going out with someone , as long as it is n't used as a pathway to other things , as long as there are clear cut boundaries between you and ( this does sound very cheesy and i 'm not really sure what i mean by it ) as long as it happens in the context of a godly relationship . ^ as i said , all these are great in theory . ^ practice is much harder , especially as society demands of us that we pull every weekend until we find mr. /miss perfect . ^  har , yes , like that 's going to happen . ^ i think what i find difficult is that so much of my identity relies on who and what other people think i am . ^ to trust that (  har )  ame loves you whatever you look like or however horrible you are and (  har )  ame has a plan for you and that this may not involve marriage , is the thing i find most difficult of all . ^ i would like to be going out with someone , but because i would actually like to be going out with anyone , i 'm pretty sure that  ame is n't going to put me in a relationship just yet . ^ firstly , i need to learn to trust him , and rely on him for self-worth rather than other people . ^ secondly , i need to learn to appreciate my friends . ^ thirdly , i need to get out more ... no , i 'm kidding on the thirdly . ^ when it 's right , i will be in a relationship . ^ but please do n't think i 've gone all pious and holy for once in my very levity-lived life . ^ this is all how the sensible , theoretical , practicing for motherhood part of my brain works- the little part of my brain that so often gets over-rided by the irrational , practical , society-minded ,  ame that i struggle so hard to control , even here , among friends , even now , at an age where i should be getting sensible , even in  ame , where the support network is so good but i still feel lonely and there does n't seem to be any room to make mistakes , even as a rep , when my behaviour suddenly got worse ( ! ) ... so good in theory , so bad in practice ( me , that is ) . ^ i hope i have n't freaked anyone out too much , or said too much ( hmmmm ) . ^ this is n't an attack on  ame 's opinions , but a clarification of my own . ^ i was thinking that maybe we could start an email prayer list ... just among a few friends of us ? ^ i know that i do n't pray enough , and i know that i do n't pray for my friends enough , and ,  ame , it would be good to do that . ^ just call me sister  ame the pious ... anyway , i would feel selfishly better if people i know and love were praying for me . ^ let me know what you think , not just about the prayer stuff , but about all this email . ^  ame apologies for clogging up your inboxes and for any spelling mistakes . ^ and yes , this has taken the place of a morning 's revision . ^ also , everyone should read  ame 's friend 's book " the relationships revolution " because it makes a lot of sense . ^ a lot of sense . ^ love ,  ame xx ^  ame if you could maybe not reveal the contents of this to anyone , that would be good for my peace of mind . ^ thank you kindly . </text_normal></message_body></message>
