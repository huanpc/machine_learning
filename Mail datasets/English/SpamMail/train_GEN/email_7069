^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your email , and interest . 
^ the best thing to do is to book a time in for the first session , and take it from there ( if we go ahead with the main study ) . 
^ i normally test between &num & &num monday - friday with occasional exceptions . 
^ would you be able to do the first session next tuesday , wednesday or thursday within these times ? 
^ it takes about &num hour at the most . 
^ if you can suggest a couple of times within these hours then i should be able to confirm it ! 
^ look forward to hearing from you , 
^ thanks ,
