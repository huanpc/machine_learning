^ &name
^ burmese people in &name 
^ in the middle of the &name &name is the island of &name . 
^ for decades , it has been a base for the us navy operating in the &name &name . 
^ it has also attracted thousands of burmese people , as it is a gateway to residence in the &name . 
^ over the last few years , there has been quite a bit of outreach among them by a burmese pastor , and many people appear to have responded to &name , and have proceeded for baptism . 
^ however , there have been accusations that their motives may not have been of a spiritual nature , but out of opportunism , as it seems to be easier for christians than for &name to obtain quicker permission to get to the &name . 
^ - pray for all the burmese people who hear the gospel , that there would be genuine understanding , repentance and turning to &name . 
^ - pray for discernment for the pastor , to know which decisions are genuine and which are fake

^ these people are on the move a lot , and it is easy for them to fall away from their newly-found faith if they do n't get adequate teaching 
^ pray for those burmese christians who make it to the united states . 
^ many have family members there already , who are likely to still be &name . 
^ their differences in religion can create many problems in their relationships .
