^ &name , 
^ although you sound as if you would be fine to do both tasks it would probably be safer in terms of keeping our results absolutely watertight if you took part only in the non sound based experiment . 
^ on monday i can test you at any time starting before &num : &num . 
^ any time on tuesday or wednesday is fine with me . 
^ shall we provisionally say &num : &num on monday ? 
^ the department of experimental psychology is building no. &num on the map @ 
^ &website 
^ i 'm in room &num on the top floor ( turn right out of the lift / stairs and follow the corridor all the way round to the corner of the building ) . 
^ &name to see you on monday , give me a call on &num if that is not convenient for you ,

^ i 'm not free now until next week ( busy all day tomorrow and away for the weekend ) , so i ca n't do until next week . 
^ monday afternoon is a good time for me , i do n't know how that suits you . 
^ tuesday i 'm free after about 4pm . 
^ wednesday i 'm free during the afternoon . 
^ my hearing is ok , but fractionally below average and i do n't have a good sense of direction of sound , so i might not be such a suitable candidate for &name ur second experiment - though i would be willing if you still wanted me . 
^ &name 
^ on tuesday &num &name &num &num : &num , you wrote :

^ &name , 
^ thanks for the email . 
^ the experiments can be run at pretty much any time during normal office hours over the next fortnight and take place in the department of experimental psychology on the &name site . 
^ the only qualifications are that you are over &num and that you have normal or corrected-to-normal vision . 
^ however if you also have normal hearing and normal colour vision and english is your first language then there is a further experiment ( about 1hr , pays &pound; &num ) that you could do on a separate occasion . 
^ if you are still interested let me know when would be convenient for you to come in and i 'll try and arrange it . 
^ regards ,
