^ maybe it 's my computer but 
^ &char i get &num copies of " by kind permission " , one at the top right and one on the lower left . 
^ any reason for the repitition ? 
^ &name it looks out of place in the latter . 
^ &char the box for the ticket information seems too big . 
^ but this may well be my computer , because i 've not got the fonts installed properly on this system . 
^ any chance you could send it in a more 'standard " format ( eg postscript ? ) . 
^ that might make validating it a little easier. . 
^ thanks & sorry to be a nuisance &smiley

^ ok , looks good , thanks . 
^ just a few comments : 
^ &char &name &name exists to ... 
^ &char prob " should have ( small somewhere ) by kind permission ... 
^ &char not all ticket sales methods are equal - students are most likely to go by e-mail or &name , so might be worth making them bigger to really stand out &char since people often do n't see them for long , prob best just to use the @ sign for the e-mail address as it quickly identifies something as being an e-mail address , so draws attention to itself 
^ otherwise it 's fine . 
^ many thanks 
^ love &name
