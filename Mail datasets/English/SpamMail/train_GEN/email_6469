^ &name &name , here 's some stuff from &name to think about ... more from me in a few days ! 
^ love &name xxx 
^ dear int rep , 
^ the subject line tells you this is about the &name trust . 
^ in case you are not aware of &name , have a quick look at your &name termcard , where there is a brief description of what &name is and does - this is under the &name giving projects section . 
^ i am the full-time coordinator , available to be used in various ways , and keen to encourage local christians to get involved in ministry to overseas students . 
^ there are &num things i 'd like to mention here : 
^ &num ) &name 's - the international student outreach coffee bar run by &name members on fridays . 
^ new team members are always welcome ! 
^ the number of visitors that we have coming on a friday can be way more than the number of team members , leaving tables of international students with no one to talk to them . 
^ this is n't always the case , of course , but the &name 's team is abit concerned that there are few first and second years on the team to gain experience and take over in future . 
^ so please do encourage newer cu members inparticular to consider joining in. if they feel unsure about it , but are still intrigued , maybe &num or &num could go together to encourage each other , and maybe all catch the vision together ! 
^ please see the termcard for details . 
^ &num ) christmas hospitality - i guess that some of your cu members may be in touch with various undergrads from abroad who have nowhere to go at christmas . 
^ would n't it be wonderful if cu members were able to invite someone home to spend a few days with them . 
^ that could be a real highlight to the years in the &name for some of them . 
^ &name discussing with the cu ? 
^ if that 's not possible , there is a &name programme , whereby overseas students are offered the chance of spending christmas day with a local family . 
^ i can send leaflets about this if you know of any students who might like to take this up . 
^ &num ) international students in your cu - there just may be some christian international students who start coming along to your cu - remember how hard it is to join a new group of people even whenthe rest are basically similar to you - well , it 's far harder for people from entirely different cultures , as they have to grapple not just with a new group , but with a new group all of whose members are from a new culture to them . 
^ the &num thing that will cause these people to stay in your cu more than anything else is the friendship that they are offered by your cu members . 
^ please remember that it is we who are already at home in this culture who should make the first moves in friendship . 
^ ideally the whole cu would be involved in this , but if that 's impossible , might there be someone in your cu who you could actively set apart to get alongside these students , to invite them round for coffee , and to make them feel at home in your cu ? 
^ please feel free to contact me if you would like any further help with this . 
^ and now for a few points on why exactly we should take a special interest in overeseas students : 
^ &num ) &name wants us to show a loving welcome , in his name , to all those who come to our country from abroad ( &name &num : &num and a host of other passages speak of this ) . 
^ &num ) many come from countries where it is extremely difficult for christians to go to preach about &name , but while they are here there is at least something of an opportunity ( " &name " is a greek word which means " time " . 
^ 'moment " , or " opportunity " . ) 
^ &num ) many overseas students , while they are away from the constraints of their home environment and culture , are more open to learn about &name than they would be at home . 
^ there 's a lot to think about above - and a lot to pass on to your cu - but please do take the time to think about the issue of overseas students and your cu . 
^ yours in christian fellowship , 
^ &name &name . 
^ &name &name &num &name &name 's street &name &name &name &num &num &num &email
