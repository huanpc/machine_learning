^ we have heard today that some remedial work it going to have to be done on the power and data floor boxes in the &name &name building , to stop them from falling through the floor . 
^ this means that as far as possible access to the floor box and the whole carpet square that it sits in should be kept as clear as possible of obstructions . 
^ while the work is being done , equipment will have to be disconnected . 
^ although this will be disruptive , it will be a good opportunity to have floor boxes relocated if they are not in an ideal position . 
^ we do not yet know when the remedial work is to be done .
