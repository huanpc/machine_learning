^ &name , 
^ here are my solutions to the c++ practicals . 
^ my' &name " method in &name returns &num if there are no more samples to load from the audio data , so that the loop at the end of af_player will terminate , but i think really the value &num should be returned if there are no more samples to load , as this seems more consistent with the semantic of the method , ie " how many samples have i loaded ? " - &num . 
^ my solution to the parser problem is somewhat different from the suggested one , but i worked with parsers a lot last year and wanted to recall some of the techniques . 
^ regards ,
