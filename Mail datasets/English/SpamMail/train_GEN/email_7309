^ &name all ! 
^ i figured i 'd be writing pretty much the same stuff in emails to each of you so i 'm doing an exciting group &num for you ... which may come with pictures if my digital camera starts working ! 
^ firstly i am loving it here big time , even if the workload is horrendous ! 
^ yes , this year i am actually going to have to do work , it makes a rather radical change . 
^ it 's a pretty pressured environment academically but the atmosphere makes up for it and i really enjoy all of my classes , so i am happy anyway ! 
^ exciting news . ... &name &name , &name stiles and kirsten &name ! ! ! 
^ are filming a movie here in october through january and we should all get to be extras ! 
^ the movie is called the &name &name &name and it is a pretty huge deal . 
^ so when i shout " that 's my &name ! ! " please just look suitably impressed ! 
^ i was very disappointed that it didn;t &name &name &name , &name &name and &name &name , but hey , &name &name is at &name and they 're reportedly dating , so maybe i 'll see his sexy arse around campus ! 
^ have been shopping as if it was going out of style and am officially in love with &name and &name , where i have been spending much free time purchasing and man hunting . 
^ also have been buying laundry by &name &name 
^ - my favourite designer of all time who is unfindable in &name , so i have been living in &name &name and &name and &name where they have it ! ! 
^ ended up in &name after a &name inspired roadtrip with my mate &name ... ( think crossroads with &name &name and &name &name tapes ! ) and went to a coupld of &name parties there . 
^ the men were beautiful ... yet exceptionally dumb and all beered out . 
^ so i looked and enjoyed the eye candy ! 
^ &name itself is such a kick arse city .. it 's sooo vibrant , and it doesnt seem dangerous or anything , well no more than &name , and the &char is just like the underground , so it does n't seem much different . 
^ i love the mexican restaurants in &name though and i have tickets for the opera and the ballet which look stunning ! ! 
^ i 'm coxing again coz i 'm a crazy person , and &num seat raced and got &name , so i was pretty gosh darn pleased with myself ! 
^ we get an all expenses paid trip to &name too ... for training ! 
^ and we train with &name men ... so i am gettign some nice visuals ! 
^ also taking opera lessons here which are super fun , but my mum was n't too happy ... she thinks i sing loud enough as it is ! 
^ &num last thing and i hope i have n't bored any of you - except darling &name who knows all this coz she lived here ! ! ! 
^ - but the campus is beyond beautiful . 
^ it is gothic and stunning and &name covered and amazing and &name needs to take lessons in aesthetics from &name as the concrete just is n't matching up i 'm afraid ! ! ! 
^ love to all and everyone , and keep in touch ... i love hearing all the &name gossip ! !
