^ &name needs 
^ there are many outstanding needs from the move , including shelving and other furniture , keys , access-cards and so on . 
^ shelves are promised almost daily . 
^ some are here but cannot be used because we lack the necessary brackets . 
^ this is clearly completely unsatisfactory , and the suppliers are being repeatedly chased . 
^ the room keys as supplied do not fit at well . 
^ many fit only with considerable effort , some do not fit at all . 
^ the whole matter has been referred back to the building contractors . 
^ the access-control system has been a long time in installation and commissioning , but is scheduled to be handed over thursday &num september for staff training . 
^ it is hoped that cards can start to be issued friday 7th , but perhaps more realistically early next week . 
^ however , in addition to all these general matters , there are many outstanding needs for individuals . 
^ eg furniture missing or in the wrong places . 
^ with some trepidation of being buried under the list , it would be helpful if everyone could let me have details of their personal and /or group needs . 
^ thanks , &name .
