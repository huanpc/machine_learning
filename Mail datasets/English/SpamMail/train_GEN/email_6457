^ i 'm wondering , do most &name application names really need to start with the letter &char ? 
^ to me , this is the most annoying aspect of an otherwise well-working desktop environment . 
^ while including the letter i can make it easy to spot a &name application , is this feature all that useful ? 
^ and does n't it lead to confusion among newbies when &name applications have names starting with &char anyway ?

^ not that names mean much . 
^ if you find the &char menu unusable for finding apps

^ &char full-fledged app browser app is needed if you want users to be able to explore what 's installed , not some multi-layered menu tucked in the corner of the desktop .
