^ why should i get the choice between a4 / legal / letter size of paper ? 
^ in &name , you ca n't buy in a shop legal size paper only &name and . ...

^ i can think of a couple of counter points ... each category should remember the last selected item , so you should n't have to fumble more than once . 
^ alternatively , we could offer paper size as an option in the third panel . 
^ but this would be an annoyance for most , and simply removing the size picking makes it unclear for first timers and annoying for travellers . ...

^ i 'm glad &name brought this up , as i was thinking about it too the other day . 
^ &name , &name should n't have to ask you what paper size to use -- that information can be determined from the locale ( lc_paper , /etc / papersize ) . 
^ this should at least be used to determine which size is preselected the first time a user see this dialog . 
^ as for travellers , when i 'm in a foreign country on a foreign computer , i 'm probably also going to be printing stuff on a foreign printer , so using the computer 's locale to determine paper size would usually be appropriate in this case too . 
^ but this is n't really a big deal . 
^ and i 'm not really being all that constructive , so i 'll go away now .

^ [ &name , &num of the time , i just want to create a new blank document in the appropriate paper size for my locale , and i want to do it without having to think much . 
^ &name .. &name , this is the default behaviour in some other word processors ... &smiley ]
