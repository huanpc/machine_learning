^ i do n't think i need to prompt anyone to pray for whats happened today , but i 'm going to do so and i guess i wanted to know that all you guys were too . 
^ i wanted to remember that we 're all &num family , wherever we live and that though things happen that &name does n't want , he still has a purpose and will use those who know him for that purpose . 
^ and i guess that means for us : prayer . 
^ i hope that &name 's peace can be felt somehow tonight in &name , and that he might comfort those who are mourning , that this does n't lead to the kind of retribution that will cost even more civilian people 's lives , that somehow &name 's light will shine even in this darkness . 
^ &name bless , 
^ &name .
