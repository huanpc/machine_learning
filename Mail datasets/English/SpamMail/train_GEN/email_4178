^ hello everyone ! 
^ i hope you 're all well . 
^ i thought to brighten up your inboxes i 'd send you my latest triumph ( i do n't think ) on the rowing front . 
^ i 've finished the term and am still alive and have n't even fallen in the river once but this is just silly . 
^ yesterday 's sculling outing was horrible - i could n't row and was spacking about ( technical term , really ) like an idiot but that was n't the worst . 
^ i got attacked by the biggest trout you ever saw which flopped towards me and onto my boat before getting the point and falling off back in the river . 
^ i think it was my hysterical screaming that did the trick . 
^ i 've never been so frightened in my life ( yes , i know it 's irrational but i 've never liked big slimy fish coming to get me . 
^ it 's just that so far it 's only happened when i 've been asleep ) and it was a big ugly spotty hook jawed thing . 
^ &name , who was coaching me , said she 'd never seen anything like it in her life but i 'm not sure if she was referring to the fish or my reaction ... 
^ my friend &name 's reaction was " why did n't you grab it and bring it round here for dinner ? " . 
^ men . 
^ hopefully i have time for &num more outings before i come home , by which time i may be reasonably stable , be able to get in and out of a boat on my own , and have no skin left on my knuckles . 
^ and possibly enough trout for a fish dinner on sunday night . 
^ " what else have you been doing with your life ? " i hear you say ? 
^ i though rowing was life ... oh well . 
^ happy days , 
^ love from &name .
