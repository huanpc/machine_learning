^ my biggest concern at the moment is that i cannot get &name to run . 
^ this prohibits testing it at all - i merely get a security exception when it is run ( &name &name / distribution / &name ) 
^ exception in thread 'main " java.security.accesscontrolexception : access &website.socketpermission &num : &num connect , resolve ) 
^ have you any idea about this ? 
^ i 'm trying to run it on &name , though i 've just tried it on my linux box and it does the same thing there . 
^ &name does n't have &name for me to try it .

^ you need to set the security policy up for &name . 
^ if you look at the &name tutorial : 
^ &website 
^ under the heading 'start the server " there is information about setting up the policy file . 
^ the thing to do is to copy the existing java.policy file and add lines like : 
^ &website.socketpermission " &num : &num " , " accept , connect , listen , resolve " ; &website : &num " , " accept , connect , listen , resolve " ( &website changed to linux3's address ) 
^ &name 
^ " nothing would please me more than being able to hire &num programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software . " - &name &name &num
