^ &name , i spoke to my uncle yesterday about chapel , and unfortunately august has been booked up for quite a while ( members of the family book on a yearly-basis for peak times like that ) . 
^ so , i think it 's back to the drawing-board . 
^ there is a week in july that 's free , but i do n't think i can make that . 
^ from mid-september onwards is free , but i think a lot of people said they could n't really do sept , and anyway it might be getting a bit cold by then ! 
^ hmmm. . . 
^ speak soon then ,
