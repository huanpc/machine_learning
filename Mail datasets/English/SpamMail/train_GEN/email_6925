^ &name &name &name &name - very nice tool . 
^ as a suggestion , how about an option to print the file ? 
^ this is a common requirement for &name files . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'm generally of the opinion that printing readme files is something that &name authors like to think their users do , but is in reality something rarely done , since the readme information is skimmed over and for anything relevant and then closed , never to be looked at again ( unless a problem arises ) . 
^ this is based on my experiences of watching countless others install software , my own experience and talking to others . 
^ it would therefore seem a fairly pointless feature which would only add bloat . 
^ maybe you can convince me otherwise , but at the moment i remain to be convinced that printing &name files is common practice .

^ i agree with your sentiments about people printing them ! ! 
^ i was just thinking that a print facility would widen the scope of the utility from read me files , to a way of supplying formatted text for just about anything .
