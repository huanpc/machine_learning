^ &name &name of large integers 
^ introduction 
^ 3fthe problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic . 
^ it has engaged the industry and wisdom of ancient and modern geometers to such an extent ... [ that ] the dignity of the science itself seems to require that every possible means be explored for the solution of a problem so elegant and so &name 
^ &name &name gauss 
^ &char brief history of prime 
^ prime numbers and their properties have long been the source of fascination since early times . 
^ the concept of prime probably existed around the babylonian time . 
^ in &name &name ( &num bc ) , several important results about primes had been proved . 
^ for example , there are infinitely many prime numbers and the fundamental theorem of &name : every integer can be written as a product of primes in a unique way . 
^ the greek cryptographer &name ( &num bc ) also studied primes in depth and eventually devised an algorithm for calculating them &name the sieve of &name . 
^ the next important developments were made by &name &name &name at the beginning of the 17th century . 
^ amongst those he proved a result known as the &name 's little theorem , which states that if &char is a prime then for any integer &char we have ap &num a modulo p. &name 's little theorem gave light to many other results in &name &name and is the basis for some methods of primality checking which are still in use on today 's electronic computers . 
^ father &name &name , a contemporary and friend of &name , stated that 2p - &num for certain primes p. as a result we now call any prime of the form 2p - &num a &name prime in his honour . 
^ &name &name theorem was later extended by &name , who introduced the -function . 
^ keep on fast forwarding , we arrive at gauss and legendre who both investigated the density of primes and came to similar conclusion that for large &char the density of primes near &char is roughly &num / log ( &char ) . 
^ prime and the computer revolution 
^ for a long time , the study of prime numbers was perceived as a 3fpure3f mathematical pursuit with little practicality . 
^ however this was to change with the rise of computational technology . 
^ with the power of computers , we can now find exceedingly large primes . 
^ on january &num , &num , the &name computer proved that &num - &num is prime , then had time left over to prove that &num - &num is also prime . 
^ since then it has almost became a ritual to give the latest supercomputer a record high prime to prove . 
^ the picture changed again when in &num , the first of &num &name primes were discovered using desktop computers . 
^ modern cryptography is heavily based on large composite numbers , more specifically , exceedingly large numbers consisting of &num very large prime factors . 
^ the &name cryptographic system is based on the assumption that the product of &num very large prime numbers can not be easily factored , whereas to check if a number is prime can be done quickly , thus very large primes can be generated easily . 
^ complexity of &name 
^ while the sieve of &name method works fine for small prime numbers , it 's difficulty increases exponentially as the numbers get larger &name to the extent that it would require a computer the size of the entire universe to determine if &num - &num is prime or not . 
^ many other factorisation methods exist , but they vary in performance and sophistication . 
^ generally speaking , factoring algorithms come in &num broad categories : special purpose and general purpose . 
^ the efficiency of the former depends on the unknown factors , whereas the efficiency of the latter depends on the number to be factored . 
^ special-purpose algorithms are best for factoring numbers with small factors , while general-purpose factoring algorithms cope better with larger factors and are more important in the context of cryptographic systems and their security . 
^ currently , some of the best factoring algorithms include : 
^ &name &name field sieve &name the general number field sieve is the fastest known factoring algorithm for numbers larger than &num digits with running time of approximately &char ( e1.9 ( lnn ) &num / &num ( lnlnn ) &num / &num ) . 
^ &name &name &name &name the fastest known algorithm for numbers less than &num decimal digits long , with running time &char ( &char ( &char ( &num )  &name ( lnn lnlnn ) ) . 
^ &name elliptic curve method &name this method has been used to find &num digit factors , but not larger . 
^ its asymptotic running time is &char ( e &name ( lnp) ( lnlnp)} ) . 
^ &name &name &name &name special purpose algorithm with expected running time &char (  8730;p ) .

^ &name strategy for &name group &num &name &name &name &num &num 2003-01-26t00 : &num : &name 2003-01-26t03 : &num : &name &num &num &num university of &name &num &num &num &num &name &name &name strategy for &name group &num 
^ our management strategy is devised to exploit : 
^ inherent modularity of the project skills and strengths exhibited by individual group members skills and experience we would like to acquire from the project 
^ work is split up into the following main spatial units with non-hierarchical structure [ &num ] : 
^ administration and planning system integration , analysis and testing programming 
^ administration and planning : 
^ this wing has a two-fold operation . 
^ it serves to provide adequate logistics and also exercise project management skills to draw out timelines , &name and pert charts and think ahead to draw out pertinent strategies . 
^ it works to ensure smooth functioning of the other wings by ensuring effective day-to-day role delegation and timetabling . 
^ &name &name ( &name and organisation ) : 
^ &name has had previous experience of being a project manager . 
^ although our group decided not to have an overall manager , she executes much of that responsibility in co-operation with &name . 
^ this involves handling the &name logistics and organisation . 
^ she is in charge of arranging and chairing group meetings , producing and publishing documents , which include agendas and minutes . 
^ &name &name ( &name and &name ) : 
^ &name has taken up the role of sketching out strategies , planning ahead and thinking of the next step . 
^ he involves himself in drafting out timelines for the programming and system integration &amp; testing wing to ensure work is done in time . 
^ the group decided to keep a look-ahead policy and thus , &name is in charge of planning for the end-of-project presentation . 
^ system integration and testing : 
^ this wing aids and syncs with the programming unit while proving effective feedback to the administrative wing . 
^ it provides tools , testing and benchmarking for the programmers . 
^ &name &name ( systems analyst ) : 
^ &name is involved in extensive programming , testing and code review . 
^ his vast knowledge in developing computer applications keeps him in good stead with his role . 
^ &name helps by looking into various tools available for our software development to provide effective implementation techniques . 
^ &name &name ( systems analyst ) : 
^ &name has multifarious responsibilities . 
^ she looks at the &name work from an end-user perspective . 
^ she also helps out the programmers by implementing test-harnesses to examine and benchmark our code . 
^ she has done research into the suite of algorithms that our application is implementing . 
^ &name : 
^ the programming unit provides for the hard coding of the code . 
^ &name &name ( &name ) 
^ &name has enormous experience in software development . 
^ his ideas spearhead the project giving it direction . 
^ he contributes towards the integration and effective implementation of the project . 
^ he co-ordinates between &name and &name to ensure harmonious code design . 
^ &name &name ( &name ) 
^ matt3fs forte is mathematics . 
^ he has done extensive research into the algorithms that go behind our factorisation suite . 
^ &name is in charge of coding the factorisation unit . 
^ he will be implementing various algorithms that shall effectively plug into our distribution model . 
^ &name &name ( distribution ) 
^ &name , by far is our &name expert . 
^ he has come up with an innovative scheme of distributing factorisation algorithms . 
^ &name is in charge of making a distribution model that can plug into a suite of factorisation algorithms and effectively distribute their workload . 
^ our role delegation scheme relies on a minimal dependency model . 
^ we work closely in teams of &num ( or at most &num ) to ensure maximal work throughput , whilst making sure the group functions as a whole , by maintaining good communication and frequent group discussions . 
^ this is the reason why a non-hierarchical structure is adopted , whereby members have equal stature within the group and communication flows efficiently on the same level rather than up and down a hierarchy . 
^ this scheme also provides a shadowing function wherein the group can compensate for the loss of one of its members .
