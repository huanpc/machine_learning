^ i 'm a business database provider . 
^ is there a function in &name which requiring the recipient to acknowledge an agreement before opening and accessing the file? ( just like software agreements that one needs to agree to before installation ) 
^ or do you know if there 's other sources ? 
^ &name advise . 
^ thank you so much .

^ you could use a startup message with the yes / no buttons enabled and it would only continue if the yes button is selected . 
^ this would prevent extraction using the &name program unless the licence agreement was agreed to . 
^ but this would not stop the user opening the file in &name say , and extracting it from there . 
^ any self-extracting archive software will suffer from this problem , by the very nature that it is encapsulating an archive which is readable by archiving software . 
^ i 'm no legal expert , so i do n't know what the legal implications of a user by-passing the licence agreement in this manner are . 
^ however , you could use a full-blown setup utility which uses its own compression and storage format , such as the free ( even for commercial use ) &name &name ( &website and require the user to go through this to unpack the archive . 
^ yours ,
