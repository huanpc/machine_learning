^ hi &name , 
^ was good to see you and pray together this morning . 
^ i remember you telling me about having someone in to &name to talk about international mission last term , and &name has just reminded me about it . 
^ sorry i forgot to bring it up ; i am becoming more and more lazy , sorry ! 
^ i think it 'd be great to have him in ; it would have to be next week , as the last week will be a bit topsy turvy as usual . 
^ what sort of thing is he likely to say ? 
^ could you just give a brief outline , i 'm sure it 'd be wonderful for us to hear about elsewhere and pray for the world . 
^ and roughly how long- would it just be a normal int slot , or would it be better to make fuller use of him ? 
^ let me know and we 'll try to arrange it for next week ! 
^ thanks , 
^ &name
