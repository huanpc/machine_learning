^ hello everyone except &name ... re : &name 's birthday ... i 've been struggling for ideas for a present for &name but remembered today that she often says that she 's missed out on lots of things because she did n't go on exciting holidays when she was little . 
^ now , clearly we ca n't take her backpacking &name &name , but some of the things are more managable . 
^ specifically , she 's never been horse riding . 
^ there are &num places in &name that i 've got phone numbers for from the internet , but before i ring to book her a session , i was just wondering if &char ) you thought it was a good idea and &char ) if anyone else would like to come . 
^ you 'll have to pay for yourselves though ! 
^ and i need to check that it wo n't interfere with anyone else 's plans for monday . 
^ i was also wondering if perhaps there was a way of turning the day into an activity day for ruth-perhaps there are other fun things she has n't done that we could book for her as birthday presents , like absailing or parachuting ( or then again , maybe not ! ) . 
^ so let me know what you think , hope this message makes some kind of sense , looking forward to seeing you all on saturday , lots of love , &name
