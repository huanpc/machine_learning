^ dear &name , 
^ hello . 
^ i am writing this primarily as work avoidance . 
^ oh well , never mind . 
^ anyway , let me know if you find a chick on the net . 
^ i would love a little chick ; it would be so sweet ! 
^ we could put it in &name 's room , in its own little pen . 
^ i 'm sure &name and &name will be thrilled with their gift . 
^ they could treat it like a little child . 
^ perhaps it would help bring &name 's deeply hidden maternal instincts to the fore . 
^ i only hope it can put up with the rather " aromatic " conditions for a week until &name leaves . 
^ obviously we shall have to name it ; or , rather , &name and &name will . 
^ i can just imagine &name as the stern and unyielding father figure of our little chick , and &name as the sweet , cowering mother . 
^ okay , so perhaps not realistic , but an amusing depiction . 
^ fish flakes in &name 's ready &name i can scarcely contain myself in restless anticipation 
^ mustard in &name 's biscuits &name 
^ &name of the insect kingdom in &name 's honey wait , what about a bee ? 
^ that could be quite hilarious . 
^ he could take the jar back to &name demanding a refund , except he would n't be that silly . 
^ oh , and we must arrange a leaving dinner for &name . 
^ there we shall present him with his flat sweatshirt . 
^ see you later . 
^ i hope you have a good day . 
^ &name 
^ i 'm hungry .
