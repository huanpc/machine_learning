^ hi &name , 
^ in connection with the subject field are n't numbers so much easier than words ? 
^ what , you disagree ? 
^ how curious ! 
^ anyway , with regards to the question of whether or not &name and &name check their e-mail , i do not know about &name . 
^ &char i mailed him &num days ago and have not yet received a reply . 
^ ( wait i 've just &name &num ! 
^ dated &num / &num / &num , &num : 36pm ) however , &name 's email address ( &name etc. ) is actually his dad 's, so the question is whether his dad actually checks his email , and what does he find ? ! 
^ * * hmmm. &name + fire usually damaged clothes . 
^ not convinced . 
^ clothes ! 
^ what about damaged skin ? 
^ damaged computer disks ? 
^ come to think of it , damaged domestos ? ? ? 
^ you really need to straighten out your priorities ! 
^ do n't trust &name 's methods of cooking , they tend to be of the " what 's this ? 
^ how interesting ! 
^ i 'll put that in , then " variety . 
^ that made me laugh a lot . 
^ thank you . 
^ ( i 'm being serious ) . 
^ i have n't got a job either , although i 'm not looking yet . 
^ however , my mum is , so there is always hope . 
^ she 'll end up at &name 's ( her 2nd choice ) . 
^ &name ! 
^ woe , woe , thrice woe . 
^ ? ? ? 
^ i do not understand . 
^ do you not wish to see your sibling safely established in &name 's? 
^ thanks again for doing those photos for me . 
^ that 's quite alright . 
^ i enjoyed it . 
^ i could n't stop laughing when i was developing the one of you and &name . 
^ ( you know , the one where you look about &num years old . ) it is classically amusing . 
^ so much so that i took the liberty of enlarging a copy of it for myself . 
^ well , this morning i 've been filling holes in wood with wood filler , while listening to shine , &name , &name . 
^ a lovely monotonous job . 
^ this afternoon i 'm going on a trip to a garden centre , after which i shall return to prepare dinner . 
^ i intend to do something with chicken this evening ( for the meal ) . 
^ it is now this evening . 
^ the something with chicken was a success . 
^ i am going to be a leader at an scripture &name camp in a weeks time . 
^ this morning i discovered that someone from &name 's is going on the very same camp ! 
^ not only that , but she was in my bible study group last year ! 
^ &name ! 
^ the weather here is abysmal rain at &num degrees , &num degrees and &num degrees . 
^ that 's the inclination of the droplets not the temperature . 
^ writing of temperature , i 'm noticing how chilly it is up here compared to &name . 
^ totally out of the blue , do n't you think &name &name &name &name &name &name is simply delirious ? 
^ i 'm listening to it at this moment in time . 
^ &name and utter joy perhaps even eclipsing water ! 
^ well , since i 've started talking of water again , i shall stop . 
^ it is my self-regulating signal that i have nothing of any further interest to say . 
^ so , adieu , until we email again . 
^ &name 
^ ( &name is &name ! ) 
^ p.s. you never told me what you thought of the singing sheep ? 
^ i really would value your opinions for my customer survey aimed to correlate the market value of my singing sheep business to a similar one concerned with ducks . 
^ &name .
