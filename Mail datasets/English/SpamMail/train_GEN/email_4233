^ hi there ! 
^ unfortunately , i have been overwhelmed by work ( both crazy people and a-level ) for the past little while and have had little chance to reply to people 's e-mails etc. 
^ i got my a-level math ( &char ) grade that i wanted ( an &char ) , so i am quite pleased ! ! 
^ i should be heading off to university in the middle of september . 
^ but first , i must earn enough money to be able to afford to go ! ! 
^ ( hence the frantic working bit ! ) there are , however , some times when i would be able to come down ( or up ? ) and visit . 
^ i 'd love to see how you are getting on at university and what it is like . 
^ i 'll clear up a few diary conflicts and let you know . 
^ when do your terms start and finish ? 
^ it will be half-term for the little school kids next week . 
^ anyway , let me know ( until ) when you will be around in &name .
