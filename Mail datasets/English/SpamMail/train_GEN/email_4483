^ no problem &name - it was good to speak to you . 
^ about the waist thing - i think you should _definitely_ avoid it in the future . 
^ that could definitely give off the wrong signals ! 
^ glad to hear about the pool upset - i always like to hear about an underdog win . 
^ cheerio !

^ hi &name , thanks for listening to me the other night . 
^ i 'm doing a bit better now , although i am still a bit confused about a few things . 
^ i definitely think that the eye contact thing is a problem . 
^ anyway , i 'm going to the optician tomorrow , maybe i need some new glasses and i 'll ask them about why it takes me longer to focus on things . 
^ i still think i 'm giving out the wrong signals somehow , maybe i always have been , it 's just that i 'm more aware of it now than in the past . 
^ i think there are just things that i 'm doing that i think are innocent that other people do n't see that way . 
^ for example , something maybe i 'm becoming aware of is that putting your hand on someone 's hip / waist is much more sensitive than putting it on their shoulder . 
^ i think there 's been a recent incident and i can remember back to the grease duet with &name &name , and the furore over me putting my hand on her waist , which i thought was entirely innocent . 
^ anyway this aside . 
^ i took real encouragement from my &name yesterday . 
^ it was about the need for sacrifice to atone for our wickedness in &name . 
^ it had a great cross-ref to &name &num : &num where it was saying how &name had sent &name to atone for our sins and the jist was that now he has set us free to serve him . 
^ i guess it really made me think about what my purpose here on earth . 
^ also we had the clash of the pool titans last night . 
^ &name 's &char against &name 's &name we managed to upset the odds and the &char 's to pull off a &num triumph . 
^ i managed to get us off to a good start , and played pretty steadily , although my long potting was unspectacular .
