^ the webmail product cannot access folders , it only checks your inbox . ^ i look forward with growing anticipation to receiving them when you next go to  ame . ^ yes . ^ well , as for my first week back in bonny  ame i am enjoying it , but am rather bored . ^ i , too , have been seeking solace in tidying and organising my room , books , academic work , computer files , etc. i 've organised , re-organised , and cleaned up my computer goodness knows how many times . ^ just kidding actually , i 've only done it a few times seriously ! ^ thank you very much for sending me this email not only do i get to enjoy reading it , i also get to enjoy writing a reply . ^ did you enjoy your sister 's graduation ? ^ how funny to meet up with  ame ! ^  ame ! ^ i 'm pleased to hear you enjoyed the  ame convention ? ^ we almost went on sunday , but obviously not quite . ^ i think i may have met  ame  ame at that ordination service in  ame . ^ is he the one who has a church in  ame ? ^ i spent monday and tuesday going through my room with a pitchfork ^ i bet that would have been amusing to watch . ^ so , let me get this straight you danced around your room all day monday and tuesday brandishing a pitchfork in mid-air ? ^ weird heathen rituals ! ^ what on earth did your family think ? ^ my room is now pretty ship-shape and covered in posters and photographs ^ are you trying to shock me ? ^ it wo n't work . ^ i 'm past shocking . ^ actually , i 'm not . ^ i ca n't resist saying that a tidy room covered in pictures and photographs is rather a contradiction in terms . ^ a lecture will not follow this time . ^ are you excited about your sister 's wedding ? ^  ame , i guess that 's a pretty silly question ! ^ well , i hope it all goes well . ^ my birthday present : a pink handle ^ well ! ^ i 've seen ( actually , heard i 'm not sure what seeing would do to my retinal attachments ) it all now ! ^ a scanner with a pink handle . ^ cool ! ^ i 'm not allowed to open it until saturday , so i 'm getting rather excited for that . ^ that would explain the strange pitchfork rituals . ^ when you get bored you can always write me some more funny e-mails ^ may i just take this opportunity to say : you have absolutely no idea of what you have just let yourself in for ! ! ! ^ i have sent the email about  ame at the same time as this one . ^  ame ha ha ! ^ sorry , i just laughed out loud . ^ i suddenly thought about  ame punting on the river with some innocent tourists in tow , then suddenly scaring them senseless by jumping up and down , flapping his arms , and croaking like a demented raven . ^  ame has a lot to answer for ! ^ every time i see a crow here ( and there are lots around here ! ) i think could you be  ame ? ^ ( not really seriously ) i saw a whole flock of crows yesterday while i was out a bike ride the intergalactic advance party for the invasion of the scottish borders . ^ well , obviously do n't you agree ? ^ i am still wearing my  ame bracelet , and it is still helping me to behave ! ^  ame . ^ my invisible one is getting a bit worn , so i 'll need to get it mended . ^ really , the fraying hem is just appalling . ^ however , it can be very difficult to stick to being good when your family are doing your head in ! ^ do n't tell me they 're in the we love pitchforks club too ! ? ^ they wo n't let me play my  ame  ame  ame : can you believe that ? ^ no. you 're lying . ^ put your bracelet back on . ^ actually , that 's a shame . ^ may i suggest headphones ? ^ it is such a waste not to play that wonderful music . ^ my commiseration 's fellow sufferer . ^ i am coming to the conclusion that they are all rather like  ame in their approach to hymns : oh dear . ^ how awful . ^ very funny ! ^ they will have a hard time living with you for  um months if that 's the case ! ^ have you got a job yet ? ^ i have n't. ^ i 'm not going to look for one until the end of august , when i return from my holiday . ^ please email soon . ^ emails are fun . ^ i do n't get nearly enough of them . ^ yours and one from  ame are the only  um which i 've had yet . ^ (  har pitying sigh emerges from the reader ) ^ i 've been learning to cook . ^ so far i have made the dinner most days since i got back . ^ it is quite an interesting experience . ^ i also did the shopping myself today . ^ (  ame in voice of five-year-old who proudly announces the achievement of some minor feat . ) i also came across the photo 's of  ame in a compromising situation today . ^ i really do n't know what we should do with them . ^ he has absolutely no idea of their existence you know . ^ incidentally , you never said goodbye last friday . ^ i am utterly devastated . ^ ( seriously ! ) ^ i will end with the following quote from the its booklet computing at  ame . ^ do n't tell me you have n't read it ! ^ i 'm amazed ! ^ utterly confounded ! ^ bemused , confused , and finally , shocked ! ^ section  um ; ^ never forget that the person on the other end is human it is easy to misinterpret a message without the voice inflections of face- to-face communication . ^ i quite agree . ^ email has its limitations ! ^ oh well , i have now written you  um words , (  um was actually the 900th ! ^ sad ! ) most of them misplaced and probably misinformed as to the true nature of their purpose . ^ anyway , take care , have a corking weekend , and also resistance is futile . ^ see you . ^  ame [ in ] ^  ame this email contains  um words i expect at least as many in return . ^ all that remains is for me to wish you a very happy birthday on saturday . ^ you will wave good-bye to your teenage years with some sorrow hopefully , but you will get to open your scanner and will find solace in its electronic parts i do n't doubt . ^ happy birthday ! ! ! </text_normal></message_body></message>
