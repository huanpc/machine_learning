^ &name boysees . . . . ... 
^ formal hall this sunday or wednesday with the &name capulets . 
^ who is kee &char ? 
^ considering a lot of people are goign home and &name 's on in the bar i 'd rather make it wednesday which is the other alternative date . 
^ however , since competition is likely to be fierce i 'd like names in ( on &char he basis that we go for wednesday ) . 
^ seeing as i am immune to hyperbole , you will be able to fully believe me that the &name capulets are going to be a fucking good time . 
^ i learnt today that their breasts are so impressive &char hat they are actually sponsored by cindies . 
^ not sure if that 's a contradicti on in terms but anyway , it will be good . 
^ &name 
^ right if people say they can make it well make it &num . 
^ i cant ko as late as &num &name ive got other priorities . 
^ ie nets . 
^ so if &name and &name say they can make it we 'll ko at &num . 
^ then we can " bond " in the bar listening &name and &name . 
^ ive got a md of popstars if anyone wants a laugh !
