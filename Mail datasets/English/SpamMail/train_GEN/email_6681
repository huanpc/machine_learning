^ &name , re-reading my email i sent last night ( in a hurry as well ) it was more bantering then anything else . 
^ i apologise for " ranting " , perhaps i am too used to being the only &name expert that always has to tell others ( programmers &smiley what to do . 
^ it would be great if you could do user testing ; but lacking that i feel that we have seen many great ideas ( i like the host / protocol .. idea ) to get a really nice looking &name .
