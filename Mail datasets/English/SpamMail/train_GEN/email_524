^ &name and i are going downstairs to have tea with &name at 
^ 6: &num . 
^ i 'm really glad you said goodbye , since i was half-worried that you would n't, as you sometimes have done . 
^ anyway , i hope you had a good journey home and are enjoying being there again . 
^ thanks ever so much for asking me to come and see you sometime in the holidays ; i would really like that . 
^ sorry i was n't in too good a mood this morning . 
^ i was feeling a little depressed and emotional , since &name and i had " issues which we discussed " , for want of a better description . 
^ oh dear , well , such is life . 
^ it would be dull if everything was perfect . 
^ i 'm deluding myself ; it would be wonderful . 
^ sorry for going on so ! 
^ i hope you have a lovely week - when do you start your church job ? 
^ i think i 'm going to be quite bored and lonely next week , here all on my own , so please feel free to telephone me if you want too . 
^ very best wishes , 
^ &name 
^ &name did you mean to leave the apron and tea towels ?
