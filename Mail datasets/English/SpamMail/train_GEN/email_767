^ &name , 
^ my sister is in love with you . 
^ &name , she 's not . 
^ anyway , i 'm glad you are wallpapering . 
^ it will do you good to get that messy paste all over your baby-smooth hands ! 
^ i 've been away for the last few days visiting my friend &name in &name ( you might remember him ) . 
^ i had a great time and it was not at all ridiculous ! 
^ apart from the fact that i missed my train on the way home , and thus had to buy another ticket - quite painful - and that meant that i missed my football match today - significantly unimpressive . 
^ my computer science revision work is fairly boring , especially software engineering - i just do n't want to learn about requirements engineering - i just do n't! 
^ anyway - speak soon . 
^ &char 
^ &name , i am not amused ! ! 
^ just how many people has " &name shown that picture to ? 
^ revenge is sweet &name &name and i am a master of it . 
^ anyway , i hope &name is favourable to &name . 
^ " i can imagine your family standing on the highlands in the freezing drizzle , clad in your family kilts , lustily singing in the dawn on new year 's day . 
^ or have i got slightly the wrong impression ? 
^ - yes , you 've got slightly the wrong impression ! 
^ keep working at the multi-tasking . 
^ now &name , thanks for the pictures which you sent me . 
^ however , i asked for one where you looked " pensive not " evil . 
^ any more would be appreciated. ( ! ) so , what have you been up to in the past few days ? 
^ are you settling down into your new home ? 
^ today i am wallpapering . 
^ it is very boring ! 
^ yesterday i was working , which was quite good fun . 
^ i saw your 'savage garden &name &name advertised on television last night . 
^ anyway , the chemistry is going pretty well how is computer science ? 
^ &name 
^ &name i tilt my head slightly and to the side , and smile in a benign manner whilst half-closing my eyes . 
^ &name &name and i wish to invite you and &name to chat online sunday at 6pm .
