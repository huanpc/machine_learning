^ &name &name paid for the gospels personally and therefore needs to invoice &name and &name with their shares of the bill . 
^ the issue is over whether we can now afford to give all the spare gospels away at the concert event , as the concert event have n't bugetted for it ...

^ hey &name , sorry , &char obviously did n't send my last mail properly . 
^ &char may ahve got the wrong end of the stick , but i was assuming that &name main would buy the &name 's gospels , because we received a acheque specifically for the me which just nicely covered the cost of them . 
^ however , i have not seen an invoice for them to this point .

^ &char quick calculation concludes , i think , that we can have &num for the concert . 
^ i have n't heard anything back from &name yet though , so this all depends on the financial situation as well . 
^ &name - what 's your thinking ?

^ thanks everyone for doing all this , i apologise for not being on the ball myself . 
^ my own thoughts are that it would be great to use the &num that &name has , including the black-covered &num , as well as whatever you can spare from the &num or so that &name has- how many of these do you think should be reserved for the witness cafe ? 
^ how we distribute the gospels is another question- we originally thought it would be great to give out &num to every member of the audience with their programme , but because i was supposed to sort this out much earlier , and did n't get myself organised ( i 'm really sorry ... ) , it does n't look like this will be possible . 
^ although if &name people pass theirs on , there may be enough for all the non-christians , plus maybe the performers too ... ? 
^ anyone have any thoughts on this ? 
^ sorry , i have to dash ... 
^ love &name

^ yes , i would say i have at least another &num in my room , although this does include the &name 's gospels from the " breakthrough " mission of a few years ago and the &num used for last year 's me ( the &num with black , rather than red , covers ) . 
^ but , if you 're happy to use these , as i say , i 've got another &num . 
^ i also have a stash of the blue witness caf cards .
