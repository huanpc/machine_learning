^ hi &name . 
^ &name ? 
^ it 's sunday lunch-time , and i should be sitting round some table with near and dear &num , a rosy-glow on our faces as we tuck into an enormous steaming roast turkey ... 
^ but , &name , i 'm in the computing lab , forcing knowledge into my head in preparation for fast-approaching exams . 
^ the problem is , the closer i get to exam-time the less i 'm motivated to revise . 
^ &name well . 
^ played my first game of squash for ages yesterday . 
^ came out victorious , but at what cost .. ? ? 
^ today i feel quite beaten-up ! 
^ i have decided to start keeping a diary ! 
^ &name inspired me to do so , by telling me that he 'd managed to keep one for well over a year now , and i thought ... what a good idea ! 
^ so that 's all somewhat exciting . 
^ hope you 're enjoying that new school of yours . 
^ love &name
