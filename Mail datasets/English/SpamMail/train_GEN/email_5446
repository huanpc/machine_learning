^ my dear &name , thanks for the letter . 
^ i could not understand the foll : " he does n't really care much about most details ( &char busy ) which is both good and bad but he explains everything i ask him . 
^ i am starting the main program this week - it is about using another phd student 's program " do you mean that you are starting the phd program or putting final touches to your &name ? 
^ what is &char busy ? 
^ we are sorry to hear that you did not get the colleges you preffered . 
^ you can not be lucky all the time ! 
^ hope you get a cheaper house close by . 
^ it is the winter that bothers when you are at private places because you have to pay through your nose for heating . 
^ tell &name that the main thing is not to worry and concentrate on the final essay . 
^ getting a place at &name for &name itself is great . 
^ time will fly just as nearly &num months have passed so far . 
^ in &num months time , &num academic year would be over . 
^ we are always thinking of you and &name , and like any other old people we brag about your progress in studies with others . 
^ last saturday we were invited by &name and &name to dinner . 
^ &name is expecting and a dinner was arranged for them.next door &name also came . 
^ his wife was in &name . 
^ &name went to &name &name with one of his friends and returned to &name place at about &num pm . 
^ when is rukka coming ?

^ shall write to you soon . 
^ wish you both happiness , comfort and peace of mind .
