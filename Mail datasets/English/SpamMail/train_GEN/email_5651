^ ( &num ) new year 's trip , 4th-10th january &num 
^ as last year , we will be staying in the &name house bunkhouse near &name in &name for the club 's annual pre-term january trip . 
^ this is a great chance to burn off some of the christmas excess and relax before the rigours of another &name term in very amenable company ! 
^ the location is fantastic with walks on &name &name , &name &name , &name &name , &name &name and more possible from the door . 
^ the bunkhouse provides a comfortable base with good facilities - at least &num bunks , drying room , electric heating and cooking and a spacious living room . 
^ all you need to bring is food , drink and walking gear ( even crockery and cutlery are provided ) . 
^ there is no official club transport provided , but it is likely that various people travelling up from various parts of the country will be able to offer lifts there and back . 
^ cost to members is likely to be in the region of &pound; &num per night . 
^ friends and non-members are also welcome ( although priority will have to go to members in the event of over-subscription and nightly charge will be a couple of pounds more ) . 
^ you are welcome to join us for as many or few of the &num days as you like ! 
^ please let me know if you are thinking of coming , where you will be coming from and what your possible transport arrangements are ( especially if you are able to offer lifts from anywhere ) . 
^ it is perfectly possible to get there by public transport - i will try to help people sort out transport nearer the time . 
^ club socials are a most opportune time to meet people who might be able to help out on the transport front , which leads me nicely on ... 
^ ( &num ) club &name 
^ tuesday lunch - the final club lunch for &num will be on tuesday . 
^ the venue , as ever , is &name 's room : &name of &name &name 's college &name &name - let me know if you need directions .

^ meet or catch up with your fellow hill-walkers over a pint or &num ! ! 
^ ( &num ) talk by &name &name 
^ i think this is an entrepreneurship talk , but there 's likely to be something of interest for hill-walkers with their eyes on bigger things than &name - should be good : 
^ " is it for me ? 
^ - turning dreams into reality " 
^ with &name speaker , &name &name , the first british woman to climb &name 
^ on tuesday 3rd december , 6pm for a prompt &name start

^ whilst working as deputy editor for the sunday &name magazine " resident abroad " , she visited &name to report on an expedition climbing the north east &name . 
^ just &num years later she returned there to become the first british woman to reach the summit . 
^ she then went on to become the first british woman to climb the highest mountain in each of the world 's &num continents . 
^ the talk promises to be both interesting and inspiring , as she gives an account of her own experiences which have required endurance , courage and determination , and inspires her audience to realise their potential !

^ have a great week ,
