^ hi &name : 
^ you are in my address book under &name &name so i guess i was just getting a little confused . 
^ did you get my last e-mail which was a reply to your e-mail of november 19th ? 
^ please send me your address and phone number as i appear to have deleted the e-mail your dad sent on monday which contained your address . 
^ i deleted it intentionally but forgot your address was in it . 
^ and i have no idea where i have put your phone number . 
^ i 'm sure it 's jotted down on a piece of paper and put in a safe place . 
^ must be having a senior 's moment . 
^ &name 
^ &name

^ &name &name , 
^ i got the e-card , thanks . 
^ dad told me about the card etc. . 
^ so thanks for that too . 
^ my email address has n't changed but sometimes the programs justy decide to show the name you have in your profile instead of just your address . 
^ am i in your address book under " &name &name " , by any chance ? 
^ we 're going to &name 's to buy dinner now , so i 'll speak to you later . 
^ see you , 
^ &name
