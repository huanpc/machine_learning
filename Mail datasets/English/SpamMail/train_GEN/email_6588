^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : &name &name for &name explorer ( q328970 ) &name : &num november &num &name : &name explorer impact : &name commands on a user 's system &name &name : important bulletin : ms02-066 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletins at : 
^ &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d this is a cumulative patch that includes the functionality of all previously released patches for &name &num , &num and &num . 
^ in addition , it eliminates the following &num newly discovered vulnerabilities : 
^ - - a buffer overrun vulnerability that occurs because &name explorer does not correctly check the parameters of a &name graphics file when it is opened . 
^ to the best of &name 's knowledge , this vulnerability could only be used to cause &name explorer to fail . 
^ the effect of exploiting the vulnerability against &name explorer would be relatively minor - the user would only need to restart the browser to restore normal operation . 
^ however , a number of other &name products - notably , most &name office products and &name index server - rely on &name explorer to render &name files , and exploiting the vulnerability against such an application would cause them to fail as well . 
^ because of this , &name recommends that customers install this patch regardless of whether they are using &name explorer as their primary web browser . 
^ - - an information disclosure vulnerability related to the way that &name explorer handles encoded characters in a &name . 
^ this vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a &name containing some encoded characters that would redirect a user to a second web site . 
^ if a user followed the &name , the attacker would be able to piggy-back the user 's access to the second website . 
^ this could allow the attacker to access any information the user shared with the second web site . 
^ - - a vulnerability that occurs because under certain circumstances &name explorer does not correctly check the component that the object tag calls . 
^ this could allow an attacker to obtain the name of the temporary &name &name folder on the user 's local machine . 
^ the vulnerability would not allow an attacker to read or modify any files on the user 's local system , since the temporary &name &name folder resides in the &name security zone . 
^ knowledge of the name of the temporary &name &name folder could allow an attacker to identify the username of the logged-on user and read other information in the temporary &name &name folder such as cookies . 
^ - - &num vulnerabilities that although having differing root causes , have the same net effects . 
^ all &num vulnerabilities result because of incomplete security checks being carried out when using particular programming techniques in web pages , and would have the effect of allowing &num website to access information in another domain , including the user 's local system . 
^ this could enable the web site operator to read , but not change , any file on the user 's local computer that could be viewed in a browser window . 
^ in addition , this could also enable an attacker to invoke an executable that was already present on the local system . 
^ in addition , the patch sets the &name bit on a legacy &name &name control which has been retired but which has a security vulnerability . 
^ this has been done to ensure that the vulnerable control cannot be reintroduced onto users " systems and ensures that users who already have the control on their system are protected . 
^ this is discussed further in &name knowledge base article &num . 
^ the patch also makes a further refinement to cross domain verification check that was first introduced in &name explorer service pack &num . 
^ mitigating factors : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d 
^ with the exception of the malformed &name image file failure , there are common mitigating factors across all of the vulnerabilities : 
^ - - the attacker would have to host a web site that contained a web page used to exploit the particular vulnerability . 
^ - - the attacker would have no way to force users to visit the site . 
^ instead , the attacker would need to lure them there , typically by getting them to click on a link that would take them to the attacker 's site . 
^ - - by default , &name &name &num and outlook &num open &name mails in the restricted sites zone . 
^ in addition , &name &num and &num open &name mails in the restricted sites zone if the outlook email &name &name has been installed . 
^ customers who use any of these products would be at no risk from an e-mail borne attack that attempted to exploit these vulnerabilities . 
^ in addition to there are a number of individual mitigating factors : 
^ &name &name image file failure 
^ - - &name explorer and other affected applications such as &name office and &name index server could be successfully restarted after the failure . 
^ - - &name has not identified a method by which this buffer overrun can be used to execute code of the attacker 's choice on the user 's system . 
^ - - this vulnerability is not present in &name explorer &num service pack &num . 
^ &name &name information disclosure 
^ - - the vulnerability would not enable an attacker to read , modify or execute any files on the local system . 
^ &name &name &name folder name &name 
^ - - an attacker could not use this vulnerability to read , delete or modify any files on the user 's local system other than information contained in the temporary &name &name folder . 
^ - - an attacker could only exploit this vulnerability by having a user visit a malicious web site and then follow a malformed link on this malicious web site to a second web site that the user trusted . 
^ - - this vulnerability is not present in &name explorer &num service pack &num . 
^ &name &name &name &name , &name domain verification via cached methods & &name &name &name &name &name with frames 
^ - - the vulnerabilities would only allow an attacker to read files on the user 's local system that can be rendered in a browser window , such as image files , &name files and text files . 
^ - - the vulnerabilities would not provide any way for an attacker to put a program of their choice onto another user 's system . 
^ - - an attacker would need to know the name and location of any file on the system to successfully invoke it . 
^ - - the vulnerabilities could only be used to view or invoke local executables . 
^ it could not be used to create , delete , or modify arbitrary or malicious files .
