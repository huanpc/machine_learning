^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your email &smiley 
^ unfortunately , the 6th of march is right in the busiest part of term where i go to school ( &name ) so the cross-atlantic trip does n't seem very wise to take on that date . 
^ i was wondering if i could still receive funding to come at a later time ( in particular about the 20th of march when my term ends ) . 
^ any information about this ( or an email address of someone i can contact who can give me this information ) would be much appreciated . 
^ thanks !
