^ you have not yet replied to my e-mail regarding your sheep comments , dated the 9th of september . ^ i replied the very same day to you and have had no correspondence for  um days now . ^ perhaps it got lost in cyberspace , i enclose a copy . ^ anyway , i would never hold a grudge against you for calling me a sheep , at least not yet ! ^ however , thanks for the apology i enjoyed it ! ^ yes , the fuel crisis very cool ! ^ incidentally , up here in the borders , we get our oil from  ame , not  ame . ^ ( so it 's your fault ! ) ^ my room is going to be so great ! ^ - is that during the party or after the party ? ^ i assume you received a letter from the organiser of  ame 's fair ? ^ it would appear that there is going to be a huge noisy awful party in  ame house on the first day of term . ^ oh dear ! ^ i 'll have to lock myself in my room and wear earplugs , although , our flat is going to be  um without music  ame saw to that ! ^ that leaves the other  um for the ( probably ear-splitting ) band . ^ no  ame ! ^ ( i 'm not really gloating , and perhaps you will enjoy hideously loud music being played in your living area , but not me ! ) ^ i have found out about painting our flats . ^ you probably have too , but just in case you have n't got around to doing so yet , i 'll save you the cost of a phone call . ^ college says it is forbidden for students to paint their flats . ^ however , they are having quite a number of the worst rooms redecorated , ( mine included ! ) and will also try to paint any other rooms which they are asked to do by students . ^ so , on the whole , not too bad . ^ fortunately it seals the lid on  ame 's idea of having a bathroom decorated with painted fish ! ^ yes , i 'm really looking forward to going down to  ame . ^ it should be great fun . ^  ame tells me he 's on the fourth redraft of his novel . ^ apparently it 's  um typed  ame pages ! ^ incidentally , when are you going back to university ? ^ oh well , please reply promptly this time ! ^  ame ^  ame please outline your political views . ^ i am curious . ^ ( the fuel crisis has made me think ever so slightly about politics , if your wondering the reason for this out-of-the-blue question ! ) ^ here is my last e-mail ... ^  ame :  um /  um /  um from :  ame subject : to a thing ^ dear  ame , ^ firstly , before i begin to insult you many times , i would like to say how much i enjoyed your last e-mail . ^ it was amusing . ^  ame has spoken . ^ i tremble . ^ -  ame never was your strong point , was it ? ^ from a huge multinational company that cares little for individual 's needs and wants ^ - socialist ^ you have the oddest type of logic . ^ - thanks , is that good ? ^ i do n't care if my logic 's irregular , as long as a  ame would be proud of me . ^ now , what do you mean by asking me to explain what is wrong with a vinegar bottle ? ^ look your computer straight in the screen and honestly type that you serve vinegar in the bottle to guests when they eat at your table . ^ it 's uncivilised . ^ oh ! ! ! ^  ame miss  ame ! ^ i see how unusually slow of my very fast thought processes . ^ actually , i ought to have scanned all your e-mails for the word fry , but it did n't occur to me . ^ with respect to the hope-to-stick-paint-on-flat-walls-with-brush situation , i have rung up the college and been advised to speak to the domestic supervisor ,  ame  ame , who is currently away on holiday . ^ she will , nevertheless , return on monday . ^ well , what have i been up to ? ^ no , you did n't ask , but i 'm going to tell you anyway . ^ this weekend my parents are away to visit my grandmother , who lives in  ame . ^ therefore i am at home with just my brother . ^ he is currently out on the farm , as opposed to out on the town . ^ yesterday i spent the day cleaning our attic with the help of my mum . ^ we threw out lots of rubbish and there is much more room up here now i really enjoy tidying , although it gets quite tiring eventually ! ^ incidentally , that is where i am writing from , as my computer is up here . ^ today i spent the day working did i tell you i had a job ? ^ well , it 's kind of a two-day-a-week job , in the christian bookshop in  ame . ^ my dad is the manager there , so that 's how i got it . ^ however , it 's better than nothing , and there are lots of books . ^ i am shortly going to sweep and mop the kitchen floor as it needs done . ^ i also must do some ironing . ^ do you know if  ame passed her resit exam ? ^ is n't consciousness strange ? ^ just sit and ponder deeply over it for a minute and you may find it very interesting . ^ well , i shall send this e-mail to you soon , and hope i find my inbox has some new additions ! ^ well now , that tale of  ame 's deeds ! ^ what a fascinating narrative ! ! ! ^ you will be dismayed to hear , however , that i do not believe a word of it is true . ^ once again , you are trying to defile the name of  ame . ^ you are attempting to make him out as a vicious mauler capable of barbaric atrocities . ^ shame on you . ^  ame writes the following about you : i just do n't know what 's got into  ame - she used to be so harmless and seemingly docile . ^ you will hear more on this crime ^ also ,  ame was very amusing i got that joke but it is a name you may not wish to stick , fo evident reasons . ^ in addition , i am not impressed with bark bark , are you a sheep scaring dog ? ^ i do n't like dogs . ^ they have fleas , and germs . ^ anyway , i shall send you the atomic clock sequel soon . ^ in the meantime here are some voyager-related words which i found on the internet ^ why did the chicken  ame the road ? ^  ame : it 's primary goal was no doubt to get back to the  ame  ame ... and it probably misses its dog . ^  ame : whatever the reason , whatever it 's goals , we must respect it 's right to cross the road and seek it 's own spiritual awareness . ^  ame : that 's not a question we prefer to hear from a senior officer . ^ it makes the junior officers nervous . ^  ame : i do n't know , it 's my first mission . ^ torres : i 'm sure it felt suffocated by all the regulations of starfleet and just could n't take it any more . ^  ame : well , i think that ... say , that 's a lovely shirt you 're wearing . ^ doctor : how should i know ? ^ no one ever tells me anything around here . ^ i did n't even know that we added chickens to this crew . ^ all i know is that before the chicken went off to cross the road it remembered to turn me off . ^  ame : actually , captain , i 'm not really familiar with the chickens in this system ... but if you can catch it , i can cook it . ^  ame : it was remembering back to the time when it 's ancestors crossed roads all the time . ^ they lost those abilities because they stopped using them . ^ i hope that was slightly amusing . ^ best wishes , ^  ame ^ never fear shadows they simply mean there 's a light shining nearby </text_normal></message_body></message>
