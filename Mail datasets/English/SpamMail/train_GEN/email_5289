^ i 've just sent the &name &name - &num - to the printers . 
^ it will run out at &num pp this time , which should mean a reduced bill . 
^ the size of the &name has been reducing over the last few issues . 
^ &name &name ceases to be a regular contributor with this issue and &name &name will probably not provide a regular series when his &name series finishes . 
^ we will have lost one of the mainstays and i can foresee the journal becoming thinner rather than fatter . 
^ i think that the growing use of the &name has something to do with the reducing size of the journal . 
^ i am also increasingly pressed for time and it is difficult to persuade people to contribute material - most contributors are writing on their own initiative . 
^ &name &name is doing invaluable work in translating all the diagrams to &name , which is making production significantly faster . 
^ my thanks go to him . 
^ &num way of adding to the content would be to start a &name section . 
^ this would require someone willing to run it - collecting the problems , constructing the sgf files and writing the copy . 
^ this mythical person needs to be a fairly strong player and someone able to keep up the effort and deliver consistently . 
^ if anyone has any suggestions as to who might take on this role i would be glad to hear from them .
