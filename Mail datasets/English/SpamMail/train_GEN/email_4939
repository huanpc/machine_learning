^ given that my last day of work is september 5th and the final demo is right around that time , i wo n't be able to do documentation of &name &name after the demo . 
^ i just wanted to remind you of this in case you wanted to take me off the &name project for a week or so to finish commenting and to document &name &name . 
^ if this is the case , sooner is probably better than later because as the demo nears it will probably be more important that i help out .
