^ just an update for saturday - the timing was slightly out . 
^ women 's race &name men 's race &name . 
^ arrangements for cycling out however remain the same . 
^ &name 
^ this saturday is the &name vs. &name vs. eastern counties race . 
^ anyone is welcome to come along and run - and i persuade those wanting to be considered for the blues / 2nds team be in attendance . 
^ the race starts at 
^ &num 30pm and the venue is &name down , just outside &name . 
^ the race distance is approximately 8km for the men , and i presume less ( ~5k ) for the women ( can someone , &name , &name , confirm that please ) . 
^ because the race is so close there is no official transport arranged . 
^ it was considered to catch the no. &num park and ride bus to the &name rd. however , this would still leave around a mile to walk to the start . 
^ it has thus been decided that we will cycle to the venue together ( just over &num miles ) - to make sure &num gets lost . 
^ i therefore suggest that we meet outside &name &name porters lodge ( as it is central ) at about 12pm on saturday , leaving at around 12.15pm . 
^ this will give us &num / &num mins to steadily ( v. steadily ) make our way to the course and still leave enough time to walk the course / warm up . 
^ please do not be put off by the fact that you have to cycle to the venue . 
^ &name will have the minibus with him and a few people do have cars so if you are unable to get hold of a bike , or really do n't want to cycle then do n't worry - we can still get you there . 
^ after the race there will be refreshments available at wilberforce . 
^ &name to see you at &name &name at 12pm on saturday . 
^ please do n't be late . 
^ any queries - please contact me . 
^ cheers
