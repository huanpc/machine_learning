^ i 'm just trying to build up a picture of &name . 
^ i 've never heard of him before . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name . 
^ but .. how can i phrase this ... if i was trying to build a mnetal picture of someone i 'd never met , asking if they can fly , * wouldn't * be the first thing i 'd ask . 
^ do you see where i 'm coming from ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ his physical characteristics would be radically different if he could fly and did have wings - so i think its a valid question . 
^ what would your first question be ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ what is this " laget " ?

^ just quit with the whole veggie thing - meat can be soooooo good . 
^ i want meeeeeeat . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ speaking of burgers ( ad &name , for that matter ) , his new catchphrase is " i 'm really just a sensitive special burger' . 
^ hmmm. .. i 'll leave him to explain that one , i think . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that sounds just like &name . 
^ was this after &num pints ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &char ) you did n't answer my question ! 
</text_embedded>

^ my mam would probably say ... 'do n't listen to a word that &name boy says : he attacked me with a set of sharp keys upon first meeting me . " just a guess , but i think quite accurate . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ hell , i 've apologised a * thousand * times for that and she still holds it against me ? 
^ it was a simple case of misidentification , and i 'm gonna have to be reeeaaal careful here so might just shut up .
