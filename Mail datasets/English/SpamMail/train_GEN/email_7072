^ dear &name , 
^ i am writing to see if you would like to take part in a study that i am running at the cognition and brain sciences unit in &name . 
^ the study involves coming in for &num 30min-1hr sessions - twice a week for 
^ &num weeks ( or &num sessions within a &num day period ) is best . 
^ the tasks involved are : 
^ - reading text on a computer 
^ - filling in missing words on a computer 
^ - answering comprehension questions about the text and 
^ - answering some personality questionnaires 
^ we will pay a lump some of money at the end of the last session , which will 
^ be the sum of the time you 've spent here each time , plus travel , which should equate to around &pound; &num in total . 
^ participation in this experiment is dependant on a certain factor which cannot be determined until the first session ( determined by questionnaire ) , 
^ so we also have an alternative task set up if we decide not to go ahead with the above experiment . 
^ this is a one-session experiment . 
^ in this case you will just be paid for that session , plus travel . 
^ i am looking to begin testing straight away , but the study will be ongoing 
^ for the next month or so , so if your not available straight away , you can still contact me . 
^ if you would like to take part in the study or want further details , please 
^ contact me by email , or phone ( below ) . 
^ many thanks ,
