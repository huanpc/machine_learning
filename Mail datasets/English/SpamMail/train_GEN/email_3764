^ dear sir / madam , 
^ my name is &name &name , and i am currently in my 3rd and final year of an undergraduate geology degree at &name university . 
^ i hope to continue my studies in geology over the coming years . 
^ i would like to specialise in three-dimensional digital mapping of geological structures . 
^ this field is undergoing rapid development , as advances in the computer industry make it more feasible and informative . 
^ &name university has accepted my application to continue my study in this area at the phd level . 
^ they propose a three-year doctorate during which i would develop a cm scale , digital three-dimensional emplacement model of th &char whin sill . 
^ however , due to cutbacks at the british geological survey , the funds which until recently would have paid for this study are no longer available . 
^ although the project specifies the examination of the whin sill , an alternative land-based geological feature would serve just as well for the development of these mapping techniques . 
^ the cost of this research is approximately &pound; &num , &num per annum . 
^ under the advice of one of my potential supervisors , dr. &name &name , i am seeking sponsorship for this postgraduate degree . 
^ as a mining company with a vested interest in the development of the geological sciences , in particular , exploration techniques , i felt it appropriate to approach you about sponsorship for this project . 
^ it is my hope that you will consider helping me to fund this study , either in part or in full . 
^ i attach a short synopsis of the proposed phd , prepared by &name &name , &name and &name of the university of &name and an approximate breakdown of costs .

^ the intrusion architecture of the whin sill complex : digital acquisition an &char modelling 
^ digital mapping technologies provide the potential to automatically capture visualize and model the &num geometry of structures such as basins , intrusions , and fault zones . 
^ new methodologies that best combine &name , &name &name , &name data management systems and visualisation software are now urgently required . 
^ in conjunction with the &name ( &name &name &name ) and &name ( system for integrated geospatial mapping ) projects at &name , the aim of this project will be to develop methodologies of collecting spatially constrained geological information in the field and producing &num models from the data . 
^ this provides the opportunity to test a range of new technologies on a specific geological problem , including data collection , data processing , &num geological model construction and data management . 
^ the student will use &name , &name and &name &name location methods to map intrusions of the whin sill complex , to cm-scale accuracy , collating spatia &char co-ordinates on a palm-top computer whilst traversing along or across the exposed igneous bodies . 
^ the data will be incorporated onto a digital &num topographic map and aerial photograph database using industry standard &name for data management in a &name format . 
^ structural attributes observed at individual localities will be collected and stored in digital format , including contact type and orientation data , linkage features displayed , intrusion-rock type and country rock structural and contact metamorphic features . 
^ detailed digital outcrop maps will capture the detailed &num relationships and will be supplemented by digital photographs &char &char which mm-scale features can be digitised with all data ( topographic , remotely sensed images and structural measurements ) . 
^ the student will then use &name software for &num visualization of the &name data layers to provide a basis for creating a model of the intrusion network . 
^ additional constraints on the &num architecture from geophysical datasets will be incorporated as appropriate . 
^ factors determining the final emplacement of high-level dykes , sills and laccoliths are complex , and depend upon a range of physical parameters including magma driving pressure , the local ( and regional ) stress field , an &char the physical properties ( viscosity and density ) of the intruding magma . 
^ despite their wide occurrence and structural importance in basin architecture , their &num geometry is not well understood . 
^ the development of a digital model will allow the reconstruction of the emplacement history through time as well as an assessment of the effects of intrusion of a majo &char sill complex on basin evolution and architecture . 
^ the student will be part of the &num modelling group at &name . 
^ this include &char the &name research group ( &name &name and &name ) , a well-established group of &name and post-doctoral researchers studying the geological and rheological aspects of faults and shear zones , and the magmatic modelling group ( dr. &name ) , concerned with the influence of igneous rocks on sedimentary basins . 
^ they will receive training in state of the art digital mapping and data management techniques together with field-based mapping . 
^ this training will be relevant to a broad range of future careers in the earth sciences . 
^ related ongoing &name projects include : &num ) &name link project on quantifyin &char fault zone evolution and basement reactivation ; &num ) &name - an &name 5th framework initiative on sub-basalt imaging .
