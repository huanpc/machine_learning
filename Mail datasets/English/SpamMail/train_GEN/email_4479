^ i hear &name &char . 
^ firstly i am so bored ) i hate assignments and i hate computers ) one has just lost loads of my work ) i want to &name 
^ secondly , i do n't think it would cost that muh to go to &name but if it does then i guess i ca n't go because it is too much 
^ thirdly , &name sounds good . 
^ &name are you not allowed to fly still ? 
^ when will the flying abstinance be over ?

^ but i warn you , if we do go by car , i am sick on ferries ... can we go on the chunnel ? 
^ &name 's mum would like it ,

^ people of the &name , 
^ i am going to sample your opinion ... 
^ time is ticking along rather merrily and this has been drawn to my attention as we are nearing the end of &name . 
^ provisional holiday date is the first week of august , but this is not definite . 
^ &name , we cannot go to chapel this summer because it is all booked up . 
^ after receiving very little feedback from our last email asking if an &char of you had villas we could stay in , &name and i feel that there are now &num options ... 
^ &num ) we go to &name 's cottage next to the lake in &name . 
^ cost is likel &char to be between &pound; &num and &pound; &num each ( including flights & everything ) . 
^ but the plus point is that it 's &name &smiley and there is a bath ! ! ! 
^ and we might stay in &name for a few nights if the desire intoxicated us sufficiently . 
^ &num ) we rent a large house somewhere in &name probably and drive over to eliminate flights . 
^ cost is likely to be somewhere in the vague regio &char of &pound; &num each ( but i do n't have a clue , so do n't quote me , please ) . 
^ the plus point is the cheap petrol , but unfortunately at this stage we ca &char neither confirm or deny any rumours of a bath . 
^ these are both suggestions which have been intimated to &name and i and we want to know what you all think about them . 
^ if you have any alternat ive ideas , however ill-formed , please tell us . 
^ your friendly holiday coordinators , 
^ &name & &name
