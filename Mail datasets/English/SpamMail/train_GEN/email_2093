" </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ^ - thanks . ^ no , i never got that one . ^ definitely lost in cyberspace . ^ " )-  ame never was your strong point , was it ? " ^ - no. i am harmless and docile . ^ " ) do you know if  ame passed her resit exam ? ^ " ^ - yes , she did . ^ " )well now , that tale of  ame 's deeds ! ^ what a fascinating narrative ! ! ! ^ you will </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ be dismayed to hear , however , that i do not believe a word of it is true . ^ once again , you are trying to defile the name of  ame . ^ you are attempting to make him out as a vicious mauler capable of barbaric atrocities . ^ shame on you . ^  ame writes the following about you : i just do n't know what 's got into  ame - she used to be so harmless and seemingly docile . ^ you will hear more on this crime " ^ - fine . ^ i will never write another word about  ame to you , you nasty individual . ^ i am much hurt by your slanderous comments and passing on of things i say ( in twisted form ) to  ame  ame . ^ you are once more conspiring against me . ^ i know what i saw and i know that it was  ame . ^ so there . ^ as you do not seem to appreciate communications relating to  ame 's activities , i shall keep my future sightings of him to myself . ^ you shall hear nothing of them . ^ nothing has " got into me " . ^ i always have , and always will , tell the truth . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )i do n't like dogs . ^ they have fleas , and germs . " ^ - i do n't like sheep . ^ they have ticks , foot-rot , scraggy coats , horrid " baa 's' , and worst of all , doubt the truth of what i say . ^  ame is my middle name . ^ actually , i am the middle name of truthful . ^ get it ? ^ it 's interesting too , that i can never be ruthless . ^ the voyager thingy was very funny - especially the doctor ! ^ " )i assume you received a letter </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ from the organiser of  ame 's fair ? ^ it would appear that there is going to be a huge noisy awful party in  ame house on the first day of term . . . ... " </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ^ - i know . ^ very pants . ^ well , actually , i do n't mind too much so long as nobody gets drunk and trashes the place . ^ our own rooms will not be part of the parties ( mine wo n't be anyway : it will be most firmly locked ) - only the corridors and sitting rooms . ^ i shall remove my lovely rug , throws and cushions before the party stats though - ca n't have any old person slopping stuff on them ! </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ " )i have found out about painting our flats . . . . ... college says it is forbidden for students to paint their flats . " </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ^ - well , how come  ame could decorate her room with clouds on the ceiling ? ? ? ? ! ^ no , i did n't ring college about it after all . ^ this fuel shortage crisis really hit on monday - 'dry " petrol pumps galore here in  ame - so i thought there was little point in thinking of painting if i could n't get the car through to  ame to take the necessary stuff . ^ mam , being a doctor and needing the car for visits etc , has had to be really careful on fuel consumption . ^ anyway , loads of people have painted their rooms . ^  ame  ame says that  ame  ame et  ame in his flat have painted the sitting room a " vivid blue colour " . . ...  ame has painted her room in our flat . ...  ame has probably done hers by this time . . . ... so why ca n't i paint . ^ totally unfair ! ^ " )incidentally , when are you going back to university ? " ^ - i 'm going some time in the week beginning 25th sept. probably on the wednesday , as mam is off work then so we can bring my stuff through . ^ however , nothing is fixed yet . ^ how about you ? ^ " p.s. please outline your political views . ^ " ^ - not sure . ^ let 's just say this : i do n't like  ame  ame . ^ i do n't like  ame  ame . ^ i was the conservative party campaign organiser for our school 's mock election ( we won ) in 199-whenever ( the last election ! ) . ^ i think  ame  ame is pretty spineless . ^ i wholeheartedly object to the labour party 's introducing tution fees for uni students , and think tax on fuel is abominably high . ^ the millennium dome is a big white elephant . ^ political parties have no idea what inner cities are ( i do - i live in  um ) . ^ we should never join the  ame . ^ section  um should be kept . ^ a " life-sentance " ( for prisoners ) should mean a life sentance : not "  um years and released on good behaviour " . . . . . ... ^ so , what have i been doing this week ? ^  ame "  ame and prejudice " , played football , pool and the piano ( i am steadily improving in all ) , cleaned the house , tidied , messed up and re-tidied my room , made stuff on the computer . ... etc. my days have all been pretty much the same . ^  har typical day in the life of  ame : get up at  um . ^ have breakfast and read the papers . ^ check my e-mail and write to  ame . ^ go across to the church hall and practice footy and pool - then twiddle on the church organ . ^ have lunch . ^ do house jobs . ^  ame about making things on the computer or reading a book . ^ make the tea . ^ eat the tea . ^ clear up the tea . ^ flop in front of the video machine or read a book . ^ go to bed . ^ i am now at the 'do house jobs stage " , so had better nick off and do some ironing . ^ bye for now . ^ stop scandal-mongering , from  ame ( the middle name of truthful ) get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . ^ share information about yourself , create your own public profile at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
