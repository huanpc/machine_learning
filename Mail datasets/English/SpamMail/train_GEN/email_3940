^ dear &name , 
^ thanks for the thoughts ... they are very helpful , and are the questions i am asking myself . 
^ see your email for the answers . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ hi &name , here are some thoughts on your relationship with &name , which you do n't have to read at all , and certainly do n't have to follow , but if you want to hear my battered heart 's advice . ... 
^ i thought putting off the decision would be the next step . 
^ how many is a couple months ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &char couple means &num . 
^ we both need some time to sort out our own lives . 
^ could this drag on for longer ? 
^ and is that what you 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ really want ? 
^ i know little , but surely if you are going to eventually get married then you 'll have to work through issues , not just put them off for a few months . 
^ otherwise , if you are going to break up , is it not better to get on and break up ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ fair point . 
^ i think one of the major problems has been that i have been ( and now &name is ) very busy . 
^ this means that we could not live up to the demands we were making on each other . 
^ i take your point about not wanting to drag on a sort of undecided state of affairs , and i think i wo n't let that happen ( although if i do , kick me ) . 
^ &name now i am struggling just to stay on top of work / dissertation / hockey and have literally no free time . 
^ i think &name is the same . 
^ we need some time to sort through our spiritual lives as well , and be sure of where we stand ( individually ) before &name . 
^ this is perhaps the most important since our relationship tended to be fairly inward looking which was not good . 
^ if you do that , then it 's gonna hurt and 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ it 's gonna be final , which is a big time hurt , but then you can , ( after a suitable time of mourning and grief , singing " why does my heart feel so bad ? " - actually &name does sing that when he feels i can take it ... ) get on with the rest of your life . 
^ i do n't know , it 's probably rubbish advice , but then it is me . 
^ here 's a weird kind of flow chart ... 
^ do you love &name ? 
^ no - break up 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes , i do . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ yes - could you marry her ? 
^ no - break up 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes , i could . 
^ that was one of the conditions for going out with her in the first place . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ yes - are there lots of issues to be worked out ? 
^ no ( uh , liar ! ) 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes , certainly , and they tie in to " could i marry her " . 
^ this is the key question . 
^ i will use the next couple months to clarify precisely this . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ yes - well are they worth the effort to sort out ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ again , this is the million dollar question . 
^ we 'll see . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ yes / no - why ? 
^ are you scared of breaking up ? 
^ the security goes ... but i 've been going out with her for &num years , i ca n't break up now ! 
^ what if there is n't another girl like her ? 
^ but she knows me so well ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ exactly . 
^ it 's just been normal to be going out with her , and you 're right , the security does go . 
^ i 've built my life here with reference to her and it 's tough to stop that . 
^ the split has certainly highlighted some serious issues , and do n't worry , i will not compromise on them ! 
^ i understand ( a little of ) the seriousness of committment to marriage ! 
^ ( of the utmost seriousness &smiley ) 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ are those questions really nasty ? 
^ sorry . 
^ these are the kind of things that go on in my head ... and guess what ? 
^ in about &num years &name is gonna have these problems toooooo ! 
^ &name ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ it scares me to think of &name going through this too . 
^ but i think he may deal with it better than either of us having seen some of the ups and downs first hand ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ lots of love , 
^ &name 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ thanks for thinking of me . 
^ i am going to try and look at your stats this pm . 
^ love &name
