^ did n't you send me the " it takes guts to say " &name '' one a while back ? 
^ is that a hoax too ? 
^ what 's the point of all these anyway ? 
^ who benefits ?

^ hmm , ok , moral of the story is not to use standard replies because they go out of date . 
^ sorry . 
^ it 's just so tempting with things like this since i get so many . 
^ the point was that the chain letter you forwarded is a hoax . 
^ &name such e-mails is not a good idea because it tends to annoy people and because it fills up people 's inboxes with pointless e-mails . 
^ the pages i linked to give information on why it 's a hoax and how to avoid being taken in , in the future . 
^ the following seem to be valid : 
^ &website / &website 
^ and the following are some good guidelines on e-mail etiquette 
^ &website 
^ some of that is more orientated towards business e-mails and so does n't necessary apply to e-mails amongst individuals , but they both make some good points . 
^ best regards ,
