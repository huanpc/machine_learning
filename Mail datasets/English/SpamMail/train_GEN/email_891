^ good morning &name ! 
^ yes , i am indeed at my desk . 
^ i am currently struggling with the flipping formatting in word . 
^ &name ! 
^ it is about to drive me nuts . 
^ why ca n't it be sensible about outline numbering ? ? ? ? 
^ college is very quiet . 
^ i quite like it , although i think it would get somewhat boring if i stayed here for too long . 
^ &name and i went to her house last night . 
^ it was a good time , and i managed to mess up one of the keys on her piano whilst trying to fix it ! 
^ not so good . 
^ anyway , we had a nice stir-fry and she has just left this morning . 
^ i am seriously going to miss my internet connection when i go home . 
^ &name well , only a few weeks before i am reunited with the ether . 
^ &name , have a good day and say hi to &name for me . 
^ &name

^ hi &name ! 
^ are you busy working ? 
^ i am intending to begin today . 
^ intending being the operative word . 
^ it is quite cold here in &name , but my parents have kindly said i may put the heating on if i begin to freeze . 
^ i spend most of yesterday getting all my stuff unpacked - quite a task . 
^ i 'm having chicken risotto for lunch ; and looking forward to it immensely . 
^ last night i watched an episode of voyager - a very good one actually . 
^ i 'm hoping you 're sitting at your desk with &name when you receive this so that you can reply , but perhaps you 're not . 
^ by the way , whatever you did to &name seems to have worked . 
^ i do n't have to log in when i start up any more ! 
^ the new backgrounds are lovely too . 
^ so , how is everyone in college ? 
^ how many of you are still left ? 
^ is it lonely ? 
^ what do you think of &name more or less without its students ? 
^ did you go to &name 's house yesterday ? 
^ hope you have a good day . 
^ &name
