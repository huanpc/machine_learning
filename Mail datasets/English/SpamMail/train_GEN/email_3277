"  miley ... it comes in very handy around here ... ^ i also remember our long discussion afterwards ... to tell you the truth , i 'm still not sure i undertand some of your points - in matters of finance and economics i am ( as i 'm sure you realised ) a complete beginner ! ^ i 'm sorry if some of my comments on capitalism sounded rather critical , i 'm afraid you may just have to forgive my ignorance about the real world ... we get spoon-fed on marxism at  ame ! ^ ( and you thought marxism was dead ... ! ) ^ however , i did read ( most of ) an interesting paper this morning published by  ame (  rg conference on trade and development ) . ^ i think you can get hold of it online : ^  ebsite ^ if you are interested , it is discussion paper no.  um by  ame  ame , published december  um and entitled " free trade or fair trade ? ^ an enquiry into the causes of failure in recent trade negotiations " . ^ i think you just type  um into the search box on the web site . ^ he makes the point that , whilst trade liberalisation may be the long term international aim , it is currently beneficial for neither 'developing " nor 'developed " countries , and appears to have produced greater wage disparities both within developing and developed nations , and between the  um . ^ although the paper is not about the capitalist system in general , it seems to be the case that trade liberalisation ( and the  ame ) is the current favourite / popular objection to international capitalism ... ^ anyway , enough about that ! ^ i hope you are well and that we will meet again soon - perhaps this time in  ame ? ^ with much love , ^  ame xxx ^  ame "  ame ,  ame " (  mail ) : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ greetings all : ^ yes indeed i quite enjoyed the trip down . ^ the drive down was interesting enough and i did enjoy meeting you  ame and seeing you again  ame ( p.s. thanks for the use of the bed on the fourth of july ) . ^  ame -- you ate more than a half cow ) . ^ i survived the trip back -- it was n't bad at all . ^ in  ame -- the highways are absolutely horrendous and the lanes are narrow , as i 'm sure you can testify  ame . ^ i was falling asleep since i was running on barely any sleep for the entire week -- i was going to sleep based on  ame time and waking up to  ame  ame ( where i do n't get much sleep as it is ) . ^ i actually met up with  ame  ame in la which was the night i had quite the drive in and out of la to  ame beach while nearly falling asleep which was a little scary . <text_embedded> ^ they are probably responding more to the money-grabbing attitude of " capitalists " than to the actual far reaching effects of the system as a whole . ^ however i do sympathise with the notion that individual capitalists are not looking for the good of the whole but are ( necessarily ) trying to protect their own interests . ^ while it may be the best option of those currently available , are there people investigating other options where the good of the whole is fundamental rather than a by-product ? </text_embedded>^ does the end justify the means ? ^ and does the nullification of the ends justify the evil that is being caused by the means ? ^ the difference between " good " and " bad " is what is ultimately done with the profits and perspective . ^ certainly , there are some who may be propelled by pure greed , but if in doing so , they are doing good and creating value , why should others resent them ? ^  har , among other perhaps more nefarious things , am a libertarian . ^ i believe that there are lot of things that are " wrong " but at the same time , i believe  ame gave us free choice . ^ the beauty of capitalism is that the differentials are not so great in terms of what is " good " and what is " bad " . ^ in the ideal , capitalism gives individuals opportunities to pursue their individual talents and gifts contributing to  ame 's kingdom and society as a whole while being able to make a living of it . ^ profit is merely the value that is created . ^ and the greed that can develop only comes from a matter of perspective . ^ the great thing about this entire system is that regardless of whether one is pure of heart or evil , the outcome is good ! ^ another issue potentially to discuss is the question of paper profits . ^  ame ^ - - sorry if i was a little abrupt on this point -- it 's a bit of a sore topic since i think there is a lot of education that must be done in this respect while there are many who aggressively criticize the process without understanding it . ^ here 's a quick and dirty guide to finance : there are  um basic rules to finance - the first is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow , and that less risk is better than more risk . ^ a company is worth the present value of all future cash flows -- much like an annuity or a perpetuity in the  ame . ^ how much would you pay for a perpetuity that pays dividends forever for instance ? ^ how much would you pay for a dollar that you know you will get for sure next year ? ^ given that you know for sure that you can get x% return from a bank account , you would presumably want the inverse of that -- ie amount/ ( 1+x ) and you would be indifferent to getting the amount today versus tomorrow . ^ and that is how you arrive at a  ame . ^ risk factors in by increasing or decreasing the % rate . ^ for those who take on more risk , the more return they get . ^ the capital markets ( stock and bond markets ) therefore attempt to determine what the present value of all future cash flows is for any given organization . ^ behind each stock are companies who employee people and who innovate and build . ^ the primary market is described as being where companies first raise money in initial public offerings -- often for expansion and the secondary market is the aftermarket where this ownership trades . ^ in terms of new technology , much of the benefits would not be possible without the capital markets -- the capital markets have a real effect even though they play a supporting role . ^ for capitalism to work , there must be an efficient allocation of capital to where it is needed or else you have people making above average returns for below average risk -- much like the oil barons did -- without proper capital allocation you do n't get the necessary oportunities to build true competitors to keep the entire system in check . ^ the irony is that the opposition by  ame to trade and capitalism , if you buy the arguments below , however altruistic the means , the ends are just terrifying for all concerned -- from the goals of equality of opportunity to aiding the impoverished . ^ this may be the ultimate bottom line -- is it better to have an end result that is good with the means being questionable ( possibly good and possibly bad ) or to have an ends that is bad with the means being questionable ( possibly good and possibly bad ) ?

" ) ^ i read the capitalism article you sent ... a calm rebuttal of some  ame . ^ i agree with him that many of these agencies are criticising a system which does indeed do more for the poor than many others . ^ they are probably responding more to the money-grabbing attitude of " capitalists " than to the actual far reaching effects of the system as a whole . ^ however i do sympathise with the notion that individual capitalists are not looking for the good of the whole but are ( necessarily ) trying to protect their own interests . ^ while it may be the best option of those currently available , are there people investigating other options where the good of the whole is fundamental rather than a by-product ? ^ i do hope the trip home was easier than the one in ! ^ any word yet on the job you interviewed for in  ame ? ^ many thanks once again , ^  ame ^ - -- "  ame ,  ame " (  mail ) wrote : )  ame people ideas <text_embedded> ^ kowtowing to  ame 's enemies ; kowtowing to  ame 's  ame  ame  ame  ame ^  um /  um /  um  ame  ame  ame  um  ame  um  ame inc. ^ governments and corporations try to appease latter-day socialists who bizarrely seek the destruction of the very system that is best for the poor . ^ since the end of the  um , free-market capitalism has been in and socialism has been out . ^  ame , deregulation and open trade are now cutting-edge policies in most countries . ^ the trend , however , is too much for the suffering socialists . ^ they are biting back . ^ violent anticapitalist protests have been de rigueur lately at international summit meetings , as witness the shenanigans that bedeviled the recent european  ame conclave in  ame . ^ the political backlash against capitalism is pushed by a loosely connected collection of  um ,  um outfits that are euphemistically called nongovernmental organizations (  ame , nov.  um ,  um ) . ^ okay , the bulk of them say they have nothing to do with fomenting violence . ^ but the larger point is that these  ame are spewing out nonsensical views that would harm the poor who they claim to champion . ^ worse ,  ame are often underwritten by the very governments and corporations they self-righteously vilify . ^ some of this appeasement money comes from  ame . ^ the world resources institute , for instance , gets funds from the interior and agriculture departments and the environmental protection agency . ^  ame 's government provides almost half the funding for the international institute for  ame development . ^ uncle  ame kicked in $  um ,  um to this bunch through its fiscal year ended in march  um . ^ do n't go looking for detailed financial statements on most  ame , though ; they range from skimpy to nonexistent . ^ then there 's the absurd roster of multinational businesses that have climbed in bed with the  ame . ^ to sir  ame  ame , group chief executive of  ame  ame , " business cannot afford to fall into the trap of seeing  ame as automatic enemies . " perhaps it 's no coincidence that his company has massively underperformed the  ame oil composite index since oil prices shot up in  um . ^ sir  ame 's soothing words about the  ame recall general  ame  ame 's one-word definition of defensive warfare : 'defeat . " ^  ame dutch /  rg is another huge corporation seeking to appease the  ame . ^ the oil giant released a report in  ame boosting what 's called 'sustainable development' --in other words , the kind that 's supposedly sensitive to the environment and society at large , as determined by the  ame . ^ the company credits  um  ame , including business for social responsibility , with helping draft the report . ^ the great  ame game is laid bare in  ame  ame 's most recent book ,  ame  ame : false notions of corporate social responsibility , published by the institute for economic affairs in  ame . ^  ame , former chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation & development in  ame , documents how uncompromising the  ame are : most of them will be satisfied with nothing less than an outright repudiation of the capitalist system . ^ a hallmark of the protesters " propaganda campaigns is that growth does little for the poor . ^ according to  ame  ame , head of a laguna beach , calif.-based  ame called the shared  ame institute , " capitalism does not raise all boats ; it raises all yachts . " ^ not so . ^  ame dollar and  ame  ame of the  ame  ame have examined the growth-poverty nexus , looking at  um decades of data from  um countries , both developed and developing . ^ they discovered that growth generated by free-market capitalism indeed helps the poor , raising their incomes as much as it raises those of the nonpoor . ^ in fact , dollar and  ame found that most procapitalist policies--such as open trade and the rule of law--systematically affected all segments of the population positively and proportionately . ^ and they found that  um such policies favor the poor more than the rich . ^ one is reducing inflation . ^ this finding confirms what survey data have always shown : the poor fear inflation much more than do the rich , who have many more resources to protect themselves from its ravages . ^ the second policy is reduction of public spending . ^ at first glance this is surprising , because public spending programs are often peddled as beneficial to the poor . ^ turns out that the rich are much better placed to feed at the public trough . ^ the poor get crumbs . ^ the leaders of business and government should wake up to what  ame really are all about--and stop subsidizing them . ^  ame  ame  ame ^ is a professor of applied economics at the  ame  ame university in  ame and chairman of the  ame  ame group , inc. in  ame  ame . ^ find past columns at  ebsite . ^ important notices : this message is intended only for the addressee . ^ please notify the sender by e-mail if you are not the intended recipient . ^ if you are not the intended recipient , you may not copy , disclose , or distribute this message or its contents to any other person and any such actions may be unlawful . ^ banc of  ame securities  ame ( "  ame " ) does not accept time sensitive , action-oriented messages or transaction orders , including orders to purchase or sell securities , via e-mail . ^  ame reserves the right to monitor and review the content of all messages sent to or from this e-mail address . ^ messages sent to or from this e-mail address may be stored on the  ame e-mail system . </text_embedded>^ do you  ame ! ? ^ get your free mail address at  ebsite or your free mail address at  ebsite ^ important notices : this message is intended only for the addressee . ^ please notify the sender by e-mail if you are not the intended recipient . ^ if you are not the intended recipient , you may not copy , disclose , or distribute this message or its contents to any other person and any such actions may be unlawful . </text_embedded>^ banc of  ame securities  ame ( "  ame " ) does not accept time sensitive , action-oriented messages or transaction orders , including orders to purchase or sell securities , via e-mail . ^  ame reserves the right to monitor and review the content of all messages sent to or from this e-mail address . ^ messages sent to or from this e-mail address may be stored on the  ame e-mail system . </text_embedded></message_body></message>
