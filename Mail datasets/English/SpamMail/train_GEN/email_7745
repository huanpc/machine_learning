^ dear college president and welfare officers , 
^ i am writing to you from &name , the &name university &name , at &num , &name &name passage . 
^ our office has been provided free of rent by &name college for the last &num years , and i am writing to you with regards to the financial difficulty were are currently facing . 
^ due to changes in their own finances , &name feel that they may now need to charge us rent of &num &name per year for use of the premises . 
^ however , our present system of funding will be unable to cope with this regular demand of rent , since we are currently only funded by occasional donations from different colleges . 
^ by switching to payment of an annual rent to &name , we feel we would need a fixed source of funding to cover our rent and running costs . 
^ after much discussion , we have decided that the best way in which we could solve this problem would be for this money to be given to us as a levy shared equally between the different colleges . 
^ since &name has helped us so generously in the past , it seems fairer to share the costs equally between all colleges in the university . 
^ since we would need less than &num &name per year for rent and running expenses , this would work out to a little over &num &name per college . 
^ the paper detailing this issue is currently in the senior tutors welfare committee . 
^ it has been suggested to us that we provide letters of support from &name presidents stating that they agree with the case and feel that we should get the levy . 
^ these letters would help convince the welfare committee and the levies committee . 
^ i would like to request you to show your support for the service we provide and ensuring that we can continue the work we are currently doing for the students who need us by sending us a letter of support . 
^ we will be sending you a copy of this note and a pre-written petition in the next few days through &name . 
^ we would be grateful if you could endorse the letter of support , and also add on any individual comments on it , and send the letter addressed to : the senior tutors welfare committee , for the attention of dr. &name &name , ( &name &name treasurer ) senior tutor , &name college . 
^ thank you for your co-operation and understanding .
