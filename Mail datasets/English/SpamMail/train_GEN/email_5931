^ from my experience supporting &name users professionally , &name has done a brilliant job of masking a great deal of the complexity of creating hig &char quality &name , without handcuffing advanced users . 
^ &name &name with &name , &name etc , is often fraught with errors for many users .

^ i think it is important to appreciate that &name is still a young and quickly developing project , which is entirely made of volunteers . 
^ i am of the mind there is a place for both &name and &name . 
^ we are luck &char to have both freely available with active development and support .
