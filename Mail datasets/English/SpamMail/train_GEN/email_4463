^ &name , 
^ i 'm thinking about applying for a 6-month internship in &name next year , probably beginning in september . 
^ will you be living in &name next year ? 
^ what are your plans ? 
^ if it all worked out , do you think we could we live together for that &num months ? ? 
^ the internship itself is actually at &name airport , but i could feasibly get to it by tube if i lived somewhere in &name itself . 
^ for instance , it 's about an hour from &name bridge . 
^ anyway , send me an email when you get a chance . 
^ &name &name is going well .
