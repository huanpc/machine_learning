^ &name , thanks i thought as much , just thought you may have had a magic wand .. &smiley 
^ also i am lookin at your &name program it is pretty good . 
^ can you tell me what did you write it in ( &name , delphi etc ) i am looking for some source code to see how to make menu icons like you have in your menus , i have not been able to find anything on how to do this in &name . 
^ and was wondering if you did this in &name if i could have a look at the code to see how you did the menu icons .

^ i have a comment on the selfview software that i would like to see in a new version . 
^ can you make it work work with &name files . 
^ that would be really great , because most of our customers do n't use msword so it would be nice to send them an exe file of our document .

^ &name &name files are large , complicated and undocumented beasts and the very fact that third-party word processors ( consider for example &website or &name ) despite large amounts of time , energy and man-power still struggle to get every nuance of the format correct . 
^ it would be not only difficult to implement , but would increase the bloat of &name 
^ which is designed for simple , small files . 
^ i suggest that if you want to use word files , you either have a simple document , in which case you can convert 
^ it to &name , or otherwise it is too sophisticated for selfview and you would be better either distributing &name &name &name ( which &name allow free redistribution of ) or convert it to an alternative format such as &name which can be read by most people . 
^ for the latter , if you 'd rather not pay &name huge sums of money for acrobat , you can download &name 's postscript printer driver for free which enables you to make postscript versions of your documents by printing to a file . 
^ you can then use ghostscript ( &website possibility , which may or may not be sensible , depending on the nature of your customers , 
^ &website which is free and 
^ can read &name &name files .
