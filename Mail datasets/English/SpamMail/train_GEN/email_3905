^ hi &name , 
^ following on from what i was saying before about the summer . 
^ i was talking to my dad about this . 
^ he remided me that the masters is a whole year long course , and so i probably would n't have much time this summer at all , particularly with the wedding . 
^ so , unless something dramatic happens , i wo n't be able to come on the soujourn on the continent . 
^ i am just about ok about this , as i have been able to see pretty much everyone this year , with quite a lot of frequency . 
^ i hope you are not too upset , though i understand if you are , with all the work you have put in. &num just feel that , as i do n't know how long this project will take , and since i am meant to be working through the summer on it , then it would be best not to commit to too much . 
^ i really do want to do well with this masters , now that the phd has fallen through . 
^ i hope you understand 
^ hope your last day there is good !

^ anyway , now you can look for a job . 
^ hope you 're having a really great holiday . 
^ i 'm still up in &name slaving away on my project , but only &num days left ... !

^ thanks for all your support and prayers .
