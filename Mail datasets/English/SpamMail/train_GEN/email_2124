^ now , i have a question for you . ^ if  ame was a character in  ame  ame , what would he be like ? ^ lets define some characteristics for him and possibly invent some situations and stories in which he takes part . ^ any ideas ? ^ for starters , where did he come from ? ^ " i ca n't imagine  ame and  ame being too chuffed with that : the whole flat ? ? ^ doubt they 'd find the doors , carpets , chairs , tables , beds very welcome guests . ^ -  ame . ^  ame . ^  ame . ^ well , i 'm pleased to tell you they did enjoy entertaining our beds and chairs etc. however , we had some slight trouble with the carpets . ^ it may interest you to know that they were stuck to the floor of our flat , but as they so desperately wanted to come we remedied that true , we may have taken along a little bit extra plaster from your flat 's ceiling , but the carpets really enjoyed themselves they said it was the first time they 'd been out in years . ^ ( please do n't call me a 'scandalous liar for this slightly unrealistic story  ame ! ) ^ " i 've washed my mouth out with soap  ame ! ^ - did you really wash your mouth out with soap ? ^ i 'm impressed  ame ! ^ i never thought you had it in you do carry through such a ridiculous punishment . ^ i hope it had the desired effect and that you never say " that very bad word again . ^ 'so ,  ame . ^ are you home yet ? ^ hope you enjoyed your extra time at  ame . ^ how cold is it in  ame ? ^ it is freezing here in  ame . ^ you probably wo n't believe me , but when i got back on wednesday , i could even notice a difference from the temp . ^ in  ame ! ^ so ,  ame yes , i 'm home . ^ i thought i would miss my friends more than i 've done yet . ^ however , this week should be pretty lonely as nobody else will be at home during the day . ^  miley however , i enjoyed the extra time in  ame ! ^ it enabled me to defrost our freezer  ame ! ! ! ^ ( just kidding although watching ice melt is incredibly more exciting than the paint drying process . ) anyway , back to the story well , i asked  ame in your flat if we could store our freezer contents in your freezer . ^ she said absolutely not , promptly pulled out a revolver , and shot me right between the eyes i 'm now dead . ^ no ! ^ really  ame , you should n't believe such fantastically unrealistic tales ! ^ dear , dear , dear ! ^ you 're just so gullible ! ^ ( just kidding ! ) anyway , she said certainly we could , so we did . ^ now , that was at about 11am and the freezer did n't finish defrosting until  ame . ^ ( mainly because i never bothered to turn it off whilst leaving the door open and placing large bowls of hot water inside it ! ) when i finally got around to retrieving our frozen food ,  ame had gone home ! ^ so had  ame ! ^ your flat was deserted ! ! ! ^ i was in dire straits , so i well , i wonder , what could i have ( feasibly ) done ? ^ most likely nothing , but you may imagine something ridiculous if you like . ^ so , your flat now has about  um kilos of our frozen chips , along with multiple loaves of bread ! ^ now  ame , perhaps you can reassure me here  ame happened to mention that the fee for storage in your freezer was  ound;  um per hour . ^ this did not concern be greatly as i assumed she was joking , and even if she had turned out to be serious , it would only have cost us about  ound;  um . ^ however , now that we are utilising your storage facilities over christmas , it would cost our flat  ound;  um . ^ this would lower our flat bank account balance by about  um - not a healthy way to start the term ! ^ anyway ,  ame is quite cold . ^ this afternoon my room was  um degrees  ame , and it was sunny . ^ now  ame , about the 'difference in temperature between  ame and  ame , calm down . ^ i believe you . ^  ame is a well-known veritable tropical paradise . ^ seriously though , i agree with you . ^  ame does seem a lot warmer than you would expect a city of such latitudes to be . ^ since you did a-level geography perhaps you could explain this ? ^  ame ! ! ! ^ you 've got a camera ! ^ cool ! ^ i 'll look forward to seeing it sometime next term . ^ you must be anxious for christmas to come . ^ " i spent the whole morning asleep in bed . ^ i did n't wake up until ^  um  um ! ^ how scandalous ! ! ^ well , it just proves that i 'm tired ( i am not lazy ) after a long term . ^ - hmmm.  um agree that you 're not ( too ! ) lazy , and that you were tired . ^ however , i am of the widely held opinion that this was really self-induced tiredness . ^ when you decide to get up at  um : 30am to clean the kitchen well , lets just say if you did that every day you would be a most interesting person . ^ ( not that you are n't a most interesting person already , but you know what i mean ! ) ^ well now , how am i doing ? ^ i got home yesterday ( saturday ) and tidied up most of my stuff . ^ i got your e-mail ( thanks so much it was really nice to read ! ) and stayed up rather late organising some files . ^ i then read some of a book , which  ame gave me for christmas , until 1am in the morning . ^ i then slept " till this morning and went to church , where my dad was preaching this morning . ^ after that we came home and had lunch , went a walk this afternoon and then i played the piano etc. and did nothing much until now . ^ i 'm going to try and do some chemistry tomorrow , but i 'm working in my dad 's bookshop on wednesday and friday this week so that should give me a little break from the pursuit of academia . ^ anyway , i really want to check my e-mail now and see if i 've got any . ^ (  ame said she 'd e-mail me yesterday but there were none this afternoon shame on her , the evil girl . ) so , i shall send this to you and hope you enjoy reading it . ^ i look forward to receiving your reply ! ^ see you , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
