^ the concert has now been confirmed for 8pm in &name &name 's chapel with &num seats available . 
^ i will be able to send you a copy of our english translation of the libretto shortly which you may like to refer to . 
^ last year at our concert event it was found to be helpful that a transcript of the talk given was printed in the programme , allowing people to follow if they desire , and to take the gospel talk home with them . 
^ this would mean we 'd need a copy of your talk by around the 2nd of &name - please let me know if this will be possible .
