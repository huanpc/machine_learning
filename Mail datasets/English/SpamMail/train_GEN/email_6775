^ dear &name and &name , 
^ i went to &name this afternoon to print programmes with the help of &name &name . 
^ this was sucessful ( if very poor quality ) until the copyprinter broke . 
^ hopefully it will be fixed by tomorrow . 
^ so far &num sheets ( of &num ) are fully printed . 
^ a further &num are printed on &num side only ( including outside page see below ) . 
^ if the copyprinter is fixed by tomorrow morning then i should be able to finish the rest off then . 
^ if not then ummmmmmmmm . 
^ well , ummmmmm something . 
^ i 'm not sure exactly what i will do but i guess i will be using some photocopiers either at &name or mail boxes etc. 
^ &name : i was unable to sucessfully print out a copy of the front / back pages using college computers as i do n't have the correct fonts . 
^ if you could print out a copy of just these pages and put them in your pigeonhole at &name then i could collect it tomorrow morning on my way to &name or &name or somewhere . 
^ when you print it out it might be a good idea to increase the size of the &name bit on the back page as at the moment there is a lot of white space in the margins . 
^ hopefully everything will go fine tomorrow , if not &name is open on saturday so we can use that as a backup plan . 
^ do we have a plan on how we are going to get these things folded / stapled ?
