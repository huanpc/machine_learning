^ i basically spend my days sitting at a computer with telephone headphones on - answering emails and customers phone queries , ringing suppliers and ( the incompetent ) business express delivery service ( who deliver goods ordered by our customer ) . 
^ my workmates are a nice bunch and i get on well with them all , which is a nice bonus .

^ it 's &name &name church and he is a great preacher . 
^ where did &name go in &name ? 
^ i may go and watch &name 's hockey match tomorrow : &char ) , but it depends if i can get there as it is an away match and his car might well be full of fellow players . 
^ oh , and &name is coming to visit us sometime next week , so i 'm looking forward to that . 
^ i am so glad to hear you have something sorted for this year and it 's great that you 've got funding ! 
^ it 'll be nice you 'll not be too far from home and &name and &name in &name ! 
^ you never know , i may get the chance to visit when i come accross that way . 
^ as for &name , he is ok at present . 
^ he 's due back in hospital for chemo treatment again , but &name says he is in good spirits and making the most of any energy he has to spend time with &name , his family and friends . 
^ he is so great ! 
^ well , my lunch hour has no come to an end and i really better get back to the phones .
