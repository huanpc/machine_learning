^ hi &name ! 
^ i hope everyone is looking forward to the day of flyering that is almost upon us ! 
^ because you guys are now flyering experts , this is a request for a little bit of help with some &name flyering for a change ! 
^ i guess you all know that the &name concert event , a performance of &name &name passion in &name &name 's college chapel is happening on saturday at &name , with a short explanatory talk by &name &name . 
^ we need to advertise it amongst towns-folk and students on saturday , and thought that it would be get to get some town-centre flyering done ! 
^ so , if you 're free and would be able to help for a little bit , please meet at 10am at no. &num &name street , opposite the &name museum . 
^ flyers will be provided there , so no need to panic about that !
