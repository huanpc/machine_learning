^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : unsafe functions in office web components ( q328130 ) &name : &num august &num &name : office web components , office , &name &name , &name &name , commerce server , &name &name , &name , &name &name , &name &name &name &name business server &name : &num vulnerabilities , the most serious of which could allow an attacker to run commands on the user 's system . 
^ &name &name : critical bulletin : ms02-044 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ &name : 
^ the office web components ( &name ) contain several activex controls that give users limited functionality of &name office in a web browser without requiring that the user install the full &name office application . 
^ this allows users to utilize &name office applications in situations where installation of the full application is infeasible or undesirable . 
^ the control contains &num security vulnerabilities , each of which could be exploited either via a web site or an &name mail . 
^ the vulnerabilities result because of implementation errors in the following methods and functions the controls expose : 
^ - &name ( ) . 
^ this function , by design , provides the caller with access to applications " object models on the user 's system . 
^ by using the host ( ) function , an attacker could , for instance , open an office application on the user 's system and invoke commands there that would execute operating system commands as the user . 
^ - &name ( ) . 
^ this method allows a web page to load text into a browser window . 
^ the method does check that the source of the text is in the same domain as the window , and in theory should restrict the page to only loading text that it hosts itself . 
^ however , it is possible to circumvent this restriction by specifying a text source located within the web page 's domain , and then setting up a server-side redirect of that text to a file on the user 's system . 
^ this would provide an attacker with a way to read any desired file on the user 's system . 
^ - &name ( )/paste ( ) . 
^ these methods allow text to be copied and pasted . 
^ a security vulnerability results because the method does not respect the 'disallow paste via script " security setting in &name . 
^ thus , even if this setting had been selected , a web page could continue to access the copy buffer , and read any text that the user had copied or cut from within other applications . 
^ the patch does not set " kill bit " on the control , for reasons discussed in the &name . 
^ mitigating factors : 
^ overall : 
^ - in the case of the web-based attack , an attacker would need to force a user to visit the attacker 's web site . 
^ users who exercise caution in visiting web sites could minimize their risk . 
^ - in the web based attack , if activex controls have been disabled in the zone in which the page were viewed , the vulnerability could not be exploited . 
^ users who place untrusted sites in the restricted sites zone , which disables activex by default , or have disabled activex controls in the &name zone could minimize their risk . 
^ - in the case of &name email based attacks , customers who read email in the restricted sites zone would be protected against attempts to exploit this vulnerability . 
^ customers using outlook &num and &name &name &num , as well as &name &num and outlook &num customers who have applied the outlook email &name &name would thus be protected by default . 
^ also , &name &name &num customers who have chosen to read mail in the restricted sites zone would be protected by default . 
^ - in the &name email based attack , &name &num customers who have enabled the " &name as plain &name " option available in &name or later would also be protected . 
^ &name ( ) &name : 
^ - the attacker 's code would be limited by restrictions on the user 's account . 
^ users of non-privileged accounts would limit the potential damage from a successful attack . 
^ &name ( ) : 
^ - the attacker would need to know the full path and name of the file . 
^ in addition the file would have to be viewable in a web browser . 
^ &name ( )/paste ( ) : 
^ - the vulnerability could enable an attacker to access only to information in the windows clipboard . 
^ the information in the clipboard is unpredictable and this vulnerability gives no means for an attacker to target and retrieve specific information . 
^ further , it is possible for the clipboard to be empty , which would yield an attacker nothing . 
^ - the security setting in question is not enabled by default . 
^ thus , the vulnerability does not present a threat to the default installation . 
^ &name &name : 
^ - &name systems : moderate 
^ - &name systems : moderate 
^ - client systems : critical 
^ &name availability : 
^ - a patch is available to fix this vulnerability . 
^ please read the security bulletin at &website for information on obtaining this patch .
