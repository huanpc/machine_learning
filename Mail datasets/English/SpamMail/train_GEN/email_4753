^ is it possible for me to set a cron job running , or is that something that only you can do ? 
</text_embedded>

^ no , you can do it . 
<text_embedded> 

^ i 've used " crontab &char " to set up the job , but as far as i can see it has n't actually started running . 
^ i 'm currently using " embo " in the &name lab .

^ it helps if you tell sys-admin what you are trying to do , i.e. what your crontab entry is , to save us having to look it up . 
^ embo : unix_home $ really &char crontab &char # do not edit this file - edit the master and reinstall . 
^ # ( /tmp / &name installed on mon may &num &num : &num : &num &num ) # ( cron version -- $ &name : crontab.c , &char &num &num / &num / &num &num : &num : &num vixie exp $ ) &num , &num , &num , &num * * * * 
^ i suspect the problem is the spaces with the commas . 
^ try 
^ &num , &num , &num , &num * * * * etc.
