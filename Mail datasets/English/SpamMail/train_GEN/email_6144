^ dear &name 
^ it 's ages since i saw you but i have n't forgotten how well you sing ! ! 
^ would you like to take part in the &name &name 's performance of &name 's requiem on saturday april 5th next year , in &name &name 's church , &name &name road ? 
^ it is - hopefully - going to be quite a big affair , involving present and past students , teachers and parents in both the choir and orchestra . 
^ we are going to dedicate the performance to the memory of one of our 6th form girls who died a few weeks ago of cancer . 
^ it would be so nice if you could join us . 
^ ( &name &name and &name &name would , like me , be overjoyed ! ) there will be a rehearsal on the saturday afternoon , of course , and also some evening &num in the &num weeks leading up to the concert . 
^ however , i realise that those could be difficult for you and would be quite happy if you could just make the saturday &num . 
^ ( i know how good your sight-reading is ! ! ) 
^ quite apart from getting you to siong , it would be lovely to see you again and find out how you are getting on . 
^ look forward to hearing from you
