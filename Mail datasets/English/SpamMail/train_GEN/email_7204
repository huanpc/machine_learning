^ hi &name , &name , &name and &name i 've just had a suggestion from someone which sounds very sensible at this stage , given the ticket sales figures i 've seen . 
^ maybe you 've already thought of it , but thought i 'd let you know and strongly suggest that you do it ! 
^ i suggest that we flyer central &name on friday and saturday , and flyer up to &num mins before the performance around &name ( depending on ticket availability at that stage ) let me know if you 'd need some help with printing flyers or getting a team together ( &name &name and i can try to activate the &name flyering team for this purpose if really necessary , altough i 'm guessing you 've already got this under control ... ) love , &name
