^ i now have the impression that the c4 &name machines will not be used again after the current course is over , and that you are interested in re-using some of them . 
^ &num are broken , and gt suggests not bothering to fix them ( they are beyond their warranty ) . 
^ can you send me a list of uses you have in mind for any of them ? 
^ &name said :

^ we would like to move some of the old &name machines into the &name offices , 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ which in particular ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ after september &num when he current students finish , just so there are machines for occasional visitors etc. 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ how many ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ some of the old &name machines in the new &name teaching room , so they are available for demonstrators for instance , but there 's obviously no point taking the &num with really bad screens . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &num or &num ? 
^ how can i distinguish the 'really bad screens " objectively ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ if possible , i 'd like to grab &num and install &name &name or &num or whatever on it - i need a machine to run access occasionally and to test my port of &name code . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ in your office ? 
^ the alternative is to use &name -- have you tried it ?
