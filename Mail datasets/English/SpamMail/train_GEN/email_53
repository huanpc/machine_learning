^ &name
^ &name , that would be wonderful ! 
^ there 's a map up on the board ( or there will be very soon ) telling you where it is ( if you do n't already know ) . 
^ as yet the team is pretty sparce , although i 'm hoping to get more people together this evening . 
^ i do n't know if you 've tried out any field events , but if you would like to try any out on the day , and we have a space , then you 're more than welcome . 
^ also , as you seem to be a runner , we might need you for the 4x100m ( if you wanted to ) but , again , i 'll just have to see how the team is going . 
^ but , yes , for the 200m , 400m and 800m , thanks for running ! 
^ see you saturday , &name
