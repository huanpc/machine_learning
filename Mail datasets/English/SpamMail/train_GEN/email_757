^ &name ! 
^ hi there ! 
^ glad you 've finished work , you are no doubt relieved . 
^ well , &name nutrient supplements ! 
^ i 've never heard of them . 
^ however , in general i think taking vitamin supplements is a good idea and has a positive effect on a person 's health . 
^ i think i 'll have to try and start to take iron supplements , as i often tend to approach blackout when i stand up . 
^ our foods these days do not contain what they should do . 
^ at any rate , if what i fear flat cooking will be like is true , i would definitely take them . 
^ i myself take a nutritional health drink most mornings . 
^ anyway , this flat stuff is just chaos . 
^ i ask you , does anyone actually read the e-mails i send them ? ! 
^ when i write things like please make your views known to the collective in bold capital letters , you 'd think they 'd realise i was trying to get a message across ! 
^ &name has been conjuring up more devious anti-quon propaganda . 
^ here is a sample of her latest gossip 
^ oh , i saw &name the other day , and you wo n't believe what he was up to ! 
^ we were eating our picnic [ & ] i saw &name fly past . 
^ he made as if he was going to land on the grass beside our car , and suddenly lunged to the left towards an unsuspecting seagull and proceeded to maul it good old &name ! 
^ he was good enough to let his victim fly away though - so he did n't absolutely kill it . 
^ we really must take her to task ! 
^ this is becoming an obsession with her . 
^ do you think she is working for some dark and sinister anti-quon league ? 
^ send me your wisdom and thoughts on the matter . 
^ i hope your phone gets fixed . 
^ anyway , write back soon , as e-mails are the highlights of my life ! 
^ by the way , &name also seems to think she is a member of the canine species
