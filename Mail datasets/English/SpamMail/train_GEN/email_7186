^ ok , thanks for letting us know . 
^ do n't worry about it and enjoy your choir engagements ! 
^ i 'll make arrangements for someone to be there to sell tickets - if you could make sure there is a float available plus some tickets ( perhaps let me have them at the &name on friday ) . 
^ if &name cannot do it ( esp since she is also snowed under with work - as i think we all are ! ) , then i 'm sure either another member of the admin team will be there , or else i 'll be able to call on the services of someone else ( we have for example the &name who are on our rota ) . 
^ thanks ,

^ i 'm completely snowed under with work at the moment , especially as we have a hectic choir weekend - our new organ is being blessed . . . . . ... 
^ so , i ca n't make the prayer meeting on saturday , mainly because we have to sing at a memorial service , but if you could continue to pray for the ticket sales ( which i know you will do anyway ! ) and praise &name for those people who have bought tickets by saturday . 
^ i 'm so sorry that i have to miss another meeting . 
^ also , i wo n't be available to sell tickets at &name . 
^ do you think it will be possible for &name or another member of the admin team who is able to be there to sell them , or should i ask someone in my &name ? 
^ good to hear that we sold more tickets today ; i 'll see you tomorrow !
