^ there is a new version of the &name code available in the usual directory . 
^ it addresses &num issues that were brought up , and although these are not bug fixes they may help in your development . 
^ note : you do not need to use these new files , they are simply enhancements . 
^ the new files will also work with your existing code with no change in behavior . 
^ &name &num : a new method has been added called eof ( ) that allows you to test whether all sentences have been read from the file . 
^ you may use the &name returned from this method in place of the return value from &name ( ) as your loop test variable . 
^ this allows you to continue processing the file even if you get a buffer overrun ( &name ( ) returns false) . 
^ if you determine that there are only a handful of very large sentences that you do n't want to accommodate with a huge buffer , you can &name them using this method . 
^ note you still need the return value from &name ( ) to determine whether to process the &name or not from that sentence ( a return value of false indicates an error reading the sentence and the &name is not valid) . 
^ &website for an example of how to implement this . 
^ &name &num : some buffer overruns are due to line length overflows . 
^ these have not come up in the regular &name but may show up in the named entities because they are stored as &num sentence per line . 
^ long sentences may overrun the maximum line length used to read the sentences . 
^ in this case , the error message would not display helpful information . 
^ i have now remedied this by moving the previous hardcoded maximum line length into a #define in the header file . 
^ also the error message will indicate this value needs to be increased .
