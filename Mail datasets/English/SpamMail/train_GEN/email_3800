^ hi &name 
^ hope you 're all all right . 
^ i am asking again for prayer for my friend &name - most of you i already emailed but this is an update . 
^ he is out in &name on the &name programme . 
^ he 's ill and seems to be getting worse rather than better . 
^ your prayers would be much appreciated . 
^ anyway i will let him explain things in his own words ( this is long sorry ! ) : 
^ &name : " apparently i have the worse tonsillitis in the history of the region , i 'm not allowed to eat and have to go to the hospital every day to get my " lunch " through a &num drip . 
^ i have a normal appetite and everything , but my tonsils are so inflamed i simply ca n't eat or even drink ... " 
^ weds : " this thing hurts like hell ... i am dangerously underweight because my last meal was on &name night . 
^ bored miserable and hungry ... " 
^ &name : " update : have just &name home from &name another &num hour shift at the hospital . 
^ &name is very worried and sent me for loads of nasty tests . 
^ then i had lunch which has been increased to &num bags . 
^ that took hours ! 
^ then &name told me that i have a virus which is why the medication is n't working . 
^ his advice : grin and bear it and keep coming back for drip ... so i guess it 's all up to him upstairs now . " 
^ sat : &name is even more worried now , it seems i am getting worse instead of better , and at this rate they might have to hospitalise me . 
^ so , prayers that this virus would get bored and leave me alone would be greatly appreciated . " 
^ &name : " just on my way home after yet another &num session . 
^ feel ok thanks to the lovely painkillers they gave me , but apparently it is even worse ... i do n't know what to think anymore . 
^ and the medication they are giving me is so strong it has given me slight liver damage so i 'm not allowed to drink for quite some time ( at last a valid excuse ! ) ... this is simply insane ... " 
^ he has really appreciated all the prayer , many thanks esp to you lot from my home group , but i think that the pressure of work , the virus , and the fact that this is really the first time &name has ever been really really unwell have worried and scared him , plus he 's usually a very active and busy person , so the boredom is driving him potty ! 
^ thanks guys ... do n't know what else to say - i am really worried but i guess all we can do is pray . 
^ love &name xx 
^ * * " work like you do n't need money , love like you 've never been hurt , and dance like &num 's watching' * * ( ) my &name website ) &website / 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ launch - your &name ! 
^ music experience &website
