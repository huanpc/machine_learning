^ hi there thought you might interested in my recent encounters with members of the reptile family . 
^ one of my patients , 8yr old boy , and his family collect live reptiles . 
^ they have a scorpion called lively , several lizards , and a &name . 
^ he very proudly told me he had named one after me .not for me to be a colourful firebellied toad , like his consultant oh no &name was a &name &name &name &name ! ! 
^ on my next visit i went upstairs to meet my namesake .the dad picked her up and she weed on him [ they shoot urine out backwards between her legs in case you ever are asked this question in a quiz ] . 
^ i then held a millipede called &name , who proceeded to wee on my hand [ this for your info has to be washed of quickly as it stains ].it is quit a weird sensation , the legs really tickle . 
^ i was then coerced into holing &name the cornsnake , who did n't wee on me . 
^ they also have lots of hamsters and gerbils etc and &num dogs , who seem quite tame after the rest of the menagerie . 
^ i pray this finds you all well . 
^ lots of love and prayers 
^ &name
