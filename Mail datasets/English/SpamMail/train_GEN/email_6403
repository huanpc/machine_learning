^ i 'm working on a small shareware scripting language . 
^ the language gets " compiled " to an exe ( using a stub executable ) . 
^ i want to be able to

^ allow 
<text_embedded>

^ i was wondering if you would be interested in providing me a custom

^ version 
<text_embedded> 

^ of your " innosetup &name &name " i could bundle with the product . 
^ basically the name would be changed , and it would simply take &num command line parameters which would be the executable to affect , and the icon to replace with . 
^ i would actually prefer no &name , maybe just some file logging . 
^ if you 're interested we can work out a fair arrangement .
