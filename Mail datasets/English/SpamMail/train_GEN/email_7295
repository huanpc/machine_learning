^ there is apparently some confusion . 
^ &name said she finishes work at 12.30pm but is owed so much time off that she is happy to finish earlier and ring . 
^ however , since then &name has bumped into &name who thinks she is ringing ! 
^ i was goint to wait until sunday so that i could talk to &name and check who has signed up on the sheet in the ringing chamber and then confirm everyone . 
^ the church office have not made the money available to me for paying the ringers so when &name called at the shop this afternoon i said i would nick some dosh from our till at work to pay the ringers and the office could re-imburse me when they 're back at work . 
^ not a good time of year to depend on me to organise anything really - i 'm not making much sense at work at this stage so there 's not much hope for other stuff ! 
^ please thank your mum for sorting out the communion wine bill so promptly . 
^ see you sunday 
^ jw

^ everyone else is fine , right ?
