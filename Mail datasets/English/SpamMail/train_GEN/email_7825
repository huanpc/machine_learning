^ &name &name im just writing to tell you what i found out about 4th year today . 
^ i have no january exams . 
^ a bonus at first thought . 
^ but noooooo i 'll have all my course exams for both semesters in may . 
^ why am i not surprised . 
^ &num bloody exams i 'll have quite close together . 
^ i 'll have to remember stuff from october in &name ! ! ! ! 
^ how am i supposed to cope with that ? ! 
^ &name been not too bad this term but you know how shit i am at organising my time and how easily sidetracked i get ! 
^ the worst bit is i 'll probably have to worry about my thesis in january so it wont make a difference if i have exams then or not . 
^ also i have to give a presentation on my thesis to the whole of the department next year fuck knows how long for ! 
^ think i should quit while i 'm ahead ! 
^ just joking you know . 
^ have every intention of staying in education for as long as possible ! 
^ bet youre so chuffed i chose you to email to get this off my chest ! 
^ i was going to email the dundonian but i 've emailed twice today already so i 'll feel like a bit of a stalker if i email again ! 
^ on a brighter note my presentation went ok i suppose . 
^ i dont have anymore to do this term anyway . 
^ we had to go outside cause there wasnt a room for us . 
^ we thought it was shit to start with but it was probably better cause it was more relaxed cause we didnt have to stand up . 
^ i didnt have acetates anyway so i didnt miss the projector . 
^ well im going home to eat . 
^ feels like &name been here foar days . 
^ think im wasting away ! 
^ &name havent eaten since &num this morning so i 'm allowed to be hungry ! 
^ lots of love , &name xx get your private , free e-mail from &name &name at &website .
