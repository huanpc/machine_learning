^ dear all , 
^ hope you could n't be more right . 
^ i am a strong proponent of ending it in style . 
^ we need to put a lot of effort into the final bit . 
^ other than the things that &name mentioned , we have to think about the demonstration . 
^ we just ca n't ask people to try and factorise numbers on that day . 
^ we need to give them more ! 
^ i have the following suggestions : 
^ &num ) . 
^ animations . 
^ something like animated algorithms ... only that these will not be dumb sorting algorithms , but things like quadratic sieve , &name rho and &name . 
^ maybe we need the experts in algorithms - &name and &name ( both of you have read and understood the algorithms ) to provide us with simplified flow charts of the following algorithms : 
^ &num &name rho 
^ &num &name &name 
^ &num quadratic &name 
^ &num block &name . 
^ please split the work . 
^ i understand that &name is still improving &name and &name , so &name , pleae can you be incharge of handing me these flow-charts by saturday ( latest ) . 
^ &num ) . 
^ we need visual aids - charts etc. for our demonstration kiosk . 
^ &name , &name is just what we want . 
^ please can you make really cool &name logos and other stylist charts , banners , flyers etc. i undertake the responsibility of getting these printed in color . 
^ remember : group meeting on thursday @ &num sharp ( &name , please book room ) . 
^ people , earlier it was : &name 's get it done . 
^ now , it is : &name 's win it ! 
^ cheers , 
^ &name
