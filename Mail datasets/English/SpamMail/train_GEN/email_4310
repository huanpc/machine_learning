^ hi &name ! 
^ i hope you had a good last week of term and got all the work done that you needed to do . 
^ i 'm more than ready to finish this term and am desperate for friday to arrive , apart from the fact that i will miss my class when i leave . 
^ i 'm actually at school just now and have just been watching the infants " christmas production . 
^ they were all really cute dancing around the stage in their duck and polar bear costumes ( it was n't a nativity play ! ) , and all the usual hilarious mishaps happened like masks falling in front of their eyes so they ca n't see where they 're going and children falling off the stage ! ! 
^ so it really has been quite an entertaining afternoon ! 
^ &smiley 
^ anyhow , i was just wondering if you were around to catch up before christmas . 
^ i was planning on sticking around for the next couple of weeks , but i 've decided to go back to &name on friday now . 
^ so i 'm free every evening except friday if you want to go for a drink , coffee ( ... sorry , i mean juice : op ) or even something to eat . 
^ it would be nice to see you again , so let me know if you 're around . 
^ laters !
