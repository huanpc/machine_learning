^ actually it avoids confusion .

<text_normal> 

^ what about &name , &name , &name , and kinput ? 
^ they all sound like &name applications , but are not . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ ( seriously , if you are offended by " k' -names , i think you will be just as offended by phantasy-names )

^ " &name " is much too strong a word , it is merely annoyance . 
^ i 'm not annoyed by " fantasy " names like evolution , but i see your point about them not being very descriptive . 
</text_normal>

^ in the windows-world a similar thing is done with the " &name " prefix , on &name they start to use the " &char " prefix and on classical &name , graphical apps are often prefixed with " &char " . 
^ gnome uses " &char " which was a mistake &name because very many non-graphical gnu-apps already use it .

^ &name explorer ? 
^ winoutlook &name ? 
^ &name ? 
^ &name ? 
^ i could go on , but you know what i mean . 
^ &smiley as for apple , they have n't extended the " &char " naming convention to everything ( &name , &name , &name ) . 
^ gnome does n't seem to follow &char " &char " naming convention that hard either ( &name and &name come to mind , the later seemingly being some creative spelling even if the &char is right ) , most of the application names are " fantasy " &num ( &name , &name , &name , &name ) or descriptive &num ( &name , &name ) .

^ that is exactly the point . 
^ &name is releated to &name - it has the same function . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ first , &name 's word processor is called word , not &name ( even though the executable might still be called that , which was done to avoid conflict with the &name version of word unless i 'm mistaken ) . 
^ and even if they are both word processors , i do n't think it benefits a non-technical user to believe &name is word . 
^ &name 's gear menu contains names like " &name ( &name processing ) " and " &name ( mail client ) " , so perhaps &num simple possibility would be an option in the control center that lets the user choose to only display the ( slightly modified ) descriptive strings , like " word processor " , 'mail client " , and so on . 
^ the title bar would still be an issue , but maybe this too could be changed in a similar manner ? 
^ i 'm not familiar enough with &name programming to know how feasible this would be . 
^ if it is feasible , it would hopefully address both potential confusion among newbies , and developers " need to feel part of the &name community , as mentioned by &name &name . 
^ but it 's just my &num cents .
