^ &name , 
^ we took back the music we had , but there were still no more parts in your pigeon hole . 
^ i asked the porters and they seemed to remember &num vocal scores being picked up or delivered at some point ( but they were n't very clear ... ).perhaps you could ask them again ? 
^ i have emailed everyone again and had a confession from the ist violinist to say she 'd given her part to an &name &name - so have asked her who that was as we 've still not seen the part ! 
^ the other &name music on your bed was in your pigeon hole - i picked it up thinking it was &name &name music ! 
^ sorry for this continuing saga . 
^ &name &name 's said that they would n't do the invoices for a couple of days so we had until then to get the parts back ... 
^ that 's ok about the flowers - many thanks for the chocolate too - it was delicious ! 
^ love &name x
