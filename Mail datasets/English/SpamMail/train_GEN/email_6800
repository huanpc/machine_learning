^ will send a photo in the post . 
^ do n't worry if it does n't suit or ca n't be sorted on time . 
^ before then , a couple of typos i found in the programme : 
^ no &num : father-in-law 
^ no &num : as as a thief in the night 
^ no &num : &name : you would have no authority over me , ( not ever me ) . 
^ i 'm sure someone has spotted them already , but just in case . ... 
^ i 'll send &num different electronic versions of my photo ( in separate emails ) in the hope you can read one of them ! 
^ and i 'll do my write-up separately too . 
^ sorry for all this hassle .

^ hi &name &name you 're well . 
^ thanks for the updated version of your talk . 
^ the program editor has suggested to me that the best way to introduce you to the audience would be to put a short piece and a small photo ( ! ) of you in the program , in the same way that there is a short piece about each soloist and the conductor . 
^ if you agree that this would be suitable , would you be able to send me a short piece ( read the program for the format of the pieces on the soloists ) and a small photo , if you have a suitable electronic photo , or could send a suitable &num 1st class in the post . 
^ thanks very much for your help , &name
