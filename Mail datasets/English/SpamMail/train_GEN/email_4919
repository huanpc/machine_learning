^ hi professor &name , 
^ i read your section of the &name paper , and i came up with some feedback for you . 
^ other people probably came up with similar feedback , but i thought i would let you know just in case . 
^ &num ) &name of page &num , last sentance : 
^ you say : rather , within the stream data model , tuples usually generated ... 
^ i think you want : tuples are usually generated ... 
^ &num ) discussion of &name on page &num : 
^ i do n't think i agree with the statement that &num tuple gets emitted per timeout period . 
^ if tuples are coming in at a fast pace , then the buffer will fill up faster ( and thus emit tuples faster ) than the tuples which are emitted due to timeouts . 
^ &num ) &name of page &num : 
^ i think there is a typo in the sentance with : suppose that a tumble box is defined with the aggregate function being one that computes ... 
^ &num ) middle of right-hand column on page &num : the sentance that says : in effect , this is accomplished by treating the stream identifier ) which is common to tuples from the same simple stream ) as an additional ( implicit ) groupby attribute . 
^ i do n't think this is true ... if it was , then the &name &name would have just &num state and would emit it and create a new one everytime a new stream id comes along ( like it does for a new set of values for the groupby attributes ) .
