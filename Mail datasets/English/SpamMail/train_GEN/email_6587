^ &char choice &name &name : critical bulletin : ms02-065 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletins at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ &name : &name &name data access components ( &name ) is a collection of components used to provide database connectivity on &name platforms . 
^ &name is a ubiquitous technology , and it is likely to be present on most windows systems : 
^ - - it is included by default as part of &name &name , &name &num , and &name millennium . 
^ - - it is available for download as a stand-alone technology in its own right . 
^ - - it is either included in or installed by a number of other products and technologies . 
^ for instance , &name is included in the &name &name 
^ &num &num &name pack , and some &name components are present as part of &name explorer even if &name itself is not installed . 
^ &name provides the underlying functionality for a number of database operations , such as connecting to remote databases and returning data to a client . 
^ one of the &name components , known as remote data services ( &name ) , provides functionality that support three-tiered architectures ? 
^ that is , architectures in which a client ? 
^ &char requests for service from a back-end database are intermediated through a web site that applies business logic to them . 
^ a security vulnerability is present in the &name implementation , specifically , in a function called the &name data stub , whose purpose it is to parse incoming &name requests and generate &name commands . 
^ the vulnerability results because of an unchecked buffer in the data stub . 
^ by sending a specially malformed &name request to the data stub , an attacker could cause data of his or her choice to overrun onto the heap . 
^ although heap overruns are typically more difficult to exploit than the more-common stack overrun , &name has confirmed that in this case it would be possible to exploit the vulnerability to run code of the attacker ? 
^ &char choice on the user ? 
^ &char system . 
^ both web servers and web clients are at risk from the vulnerability : 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ - - web servers are at risk if a vulnerable version of &name is installed and running on the server . 
^ to exploit the vulnerability against such a web server , an attacker would need to establish a connection with the server and then send a specially malformed &name request to it , that would have the effect of overrunning the buffer with the attacker ? 
^ &char chosen data . 
^ the code would run in the security context of the &name service ( which , by default , runs in the localsystem context ) 
^ - - web clients are at risk in almost every case , as the &name data stub is included with all current versions of &name explorer and there is no option to disable it . 
^ to exploit the vulnerability against a client , an attacker would need to host a web page that , when opened , would send an &name reply to the user 's system and overrun the buffer with the attacker 's chosen data . 
^ the web page could be hosted on a web site or sent directly to users as an &name mail . 
^ the code would run in the security context of the user . 
^ clearly , this vulnerability is very serious , and &name recommends that all customers whose systems could be affected by them take app- ropriate action immediately . 
^ web server administrators should either install the patch , disable &name and / or &name , or upgrade to &name &num , which is not affected by the vulnerability . 
^ web client users should install the patch immediately on any system that is used for web browsing . 
^ it is important to stress that the latter guidance applies to any system used for web browsing , regardless of any other protective measures that have already been taken . 
^ for instance , a web server on which &name had been disabled would still need the patch if it was occasionally used as a web client . 
^ mitigating factors : &name web servers 
^ - - web servers that are using &name version &num ( the version that shipped with &name &name ) or later are not affected by the vulner- ability . 
^ - - even if a vulnerable version of &name were installed , a web server would only be at risk if &name were enabled . 
^ &name is disabled by default on clean installations of &name &name and windows &num , and can be disabled on other systems by following the guidance in the &name &name &name . 
^ in addition , the &name &name &name will automatically disable &name when used in its default configuration . 
^ - - if the &name tool were deployed with its default ruleset ( which allows only &name data to be present in an &name request ) , it is likely that the vulnerability could only be used for denial of service attacks . 
^ - - &name can be configured to run with fewer than administrative priv- ileges . 
^ if this has been done , it would likewise limit the privileges that an attacker could gain through the vulnerability . 
^ - - &name address restrictions , if applied to the &name virtual directory , could enable the administrator to restrict access to only trusted users . 
^ this is , however , not practical for most web server scenarios . 
^ web clients 
^ - - the &name mail-based attack vector could not be exploited auto- matically on systems where &name &num or outlook &num were used in conjunction with the outlook email &name &name , or &name &name &num or outlook &num were used in their default configurations . 
^ - - exploiting the vulnerability would convey to the attacker only the user ? 
^ &char privileges on the system . 
^ users whose accounts are configured to have few privileges on the system would be at less risk than &num who operate with administrative privileges .
