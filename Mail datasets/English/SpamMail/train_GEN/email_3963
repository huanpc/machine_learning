^ ladies and gentlemen : 
^ i would like to state , as a neutral observer , that &name is indeed generally very good at replying to emails . 
^ i would not go so far as to say he is " great " ( to quote himself - again ) , but he is indeed well above average . 
^ he suggests we put him to the test . 
^ that could be amusing . 
^ it is true , however , to say he is generally hopeless at replying to text messages - a far more serious crime . 
^ also , 'regards and all " is no way to end an email .
