^ on sunday &num may &num &num : &num , &name &name &name wrote :

^ hi , i 've looked the very promising screenshots of &name " work : &website 
^ very nice . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i 'd like to hear the reasoning on what the advantage is to the current dialog ; this one shows all the same functions , only on different &name . 
^ seems that this is the opposite from what you want . 
^ take a look at how the background image of &name can be configured . 
^ it formerly was all &name ; now everything is in &num dialog . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ some observations and a proposition for an alternative widget : 
^ for the second pane : 
^ - it looks to me that embedding the kfiledialog is a bit too much . 
^ - it would be very nice to be able to toggle between the preview and the informations about the file ( something generally much more useful for a wordprocessor than a preview , even if it has less eye-candy ;- ) ) a search button to be able to launch an embed &name would be great 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name uses a document based approuch which means that file navigation is placed in konqueror and not in the application . 
^ to put a &name in the open dialog is not appropriate . 
^ &name 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ for the third pane , the last opened filed should be shown in a list view with the full path ( so you can tell the difference between the document on your hard disk and the bacup on a floppy ) and the date . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i good popup could fix that ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ more generally , the ok - quit buttons are not very clear . 
^ it is not a normal quit button ( meaning quit this dialog ) , here it is exiting &name , so it should be labeled differently something like " quit &name " with the same icon than quit in the file menu . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ what do you base this on ? 
^ when i close a document in &name i get this dialog ; closing the dialog certainly does not quit &name . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ something i find very counter-intuitive in the kfiledialog is that clicking on the location arrow , you get the last opened documents . 
^ i really do n't see the logic of it . 
^ it is very confusing . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i do n't understand. . 
^ the default open dialog has a editable combo for directories and for files . 
^ which one do you mean ? 
^ its all very logical to me ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ an other proposition : 
^ i 'm not a developper but i had a different idea for the the startup dialog &name more elegant , which is extending kfiledialog so you can put icons on the left column not only linked to locations but to actions . 
^ for example , you would get a left column in the startup dialog like that ( &name document ) ( &name from template ) ( last documents ) ( search documents ) ( &name ) ( my documents ) ( &name ) ( &name ) 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ trying this mixes &num concepts that should be left apart . 
^ you mix the opening and the creation of a new _docuement_ in &num dialog that is suppost to be only about file-system navigation ( i.e. _files_ ) i do n't like it . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ clicking on the first icon , would just open &name with an empty document in the standard template ( for people who want to quickly take notes without thinking about choosing now a template ) clicking on the second icon would launch your first pane clicking on the third icon would launch your third pane 
^ i think the elegance of my solution is that it is extensible and that the user can customize it . 
^ for example , when we will have search folders in &name ( i hope in the near future ) . 
^ the user could add a new icon in the column e.g. ( letters from last week ) presenting a list of all the kword files with the letter template in the /home directory and subdirectory sorted by date . 
^ something that would be great for a secretary . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ this is for just opening files ; and looks like a nice solution . 
^ but not with the ( new ) part in the file dialog as well .

^ &name : cross-posting to kde-usability 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ just as a closing statement on what the original dialog was created for ( but until today not yet implemented ) is that the dialog can be a wizard to automatically fill those templates . 
^ for example you could select a fax template in &name and get a page that asks you for extra info to fill the template . 
^ for this reason alone the choice of different &name as a top-level choice seems wrong .
