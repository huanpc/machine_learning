^ how are you old stick ? 
^ i 'm sitting at my desk , legs crossed , fingers graciously caressing &name 's keyboard ... anyway , enough ! 
^ what 's it been like in the flat ? 
^ are they networking the rooms for next year ? ? 
^ have i told you that i 'm going to be in &name college ? 
^ i will definitely get a connection in my room , which is tres bon . 
^ i am going to see miss &name tomorrow , and then on saturday we are off to bonny &name , passing by you , of course , on the way up ... lovely . 
^ i phoned up waterstones yesterday , thinking i 'd order all of the books on the core reading list from &name , until i found that one of them was &pound; &num ! ! ! ! 
^ for a flipping book ! ! ! ! 
^ so , i 've now chopped the list a little and have settled on &num more modestly priced books . 
^ otherwise , there is not much to report really ; i 've been reading and playing football and doing a little bit of post-project work and decorating our new house , etc. etc. have you finished the &name 's guide yet ? 
^ what 's the &name &name scene like at the moment ? 
^ as vibrant as last holiday ? 
^ plan for the future ... live for the moment - that 's the ticket . 
^ in a minute i 'm going to cycle into &name to get a sanding belt for my dad 's power sander . 
^ i really hate ripping up old cork floor tiles , infused with decades of urine . 
^ hmmmm. . . 
^ anyway , see you soon ,
