" oh really ! ^ well hurry up about it - i could do with another fun-filled account of  ame . ^ anyway , i detect that you are preparing something else in connection with  ame as a follow-up to your unanimously well-received voyager leaflet ? ^ when will it be ready ? ^ i eagerly anticipate its publication . ^ (  ame has informed be about it ) ^ - well , actually , ideas are rather thin on the ground . ^ i think it must be due to  ame 's absense from  ame - if he did truely follow you to the  ame perhaps something might emerge once i hear accounts of your holiday . ^  ame says  um cannot account for the strange and prolific effervations exhibited by  ame at the moment . ^ did you know about these too ? ^ - no , but  ame did say he 'd recieved a postcard from you that allegedly shows  ame in about  um effervations - is that what he was referring to ? ^  ame is deliciously cool ! ^  ame ,  ame is ridiculously  ame ! ^ me and mam went up to  ame yesterday to see  ame and  ame in their lovely new house , and it was bucketing with rain . ^ actually , i have had several excursions over the border in the last few weeks . ^ we went for a drive to the borders and had a walk and a picnic , and last week we went to  ame for the day ( needless to say , it rained on both occasions ) . ^ by the way ,  ame says disturbing news  ame has got friends lots of friends . ^ they are <text_embedded> ^ planning an invasion of earth and mean to subdue us humans . ^ this is )a time of great need , which is why i am on holiday in  ame . ^ well ! ^ another malicious rumour ? ^ what do you think ? ^ - what do i think ? ^ i think  ame is living up to his name (  ame silly ) and being his usual crazy self ! ^ evidently nothing terrible happened , as i saw him last week when i was down in  ame , and he seemed perfectly fine . </text_embedded></text_embedded><text_normal> ^ did you hear that i rescued  ame 's shirts ? ? ? ^ i was in  ame last tuesday ( i think ! ) . ^ i went to see  ame  ame , who 's been working at  ame  ame open university for the past  um weeks . ^ on my way back to the station , i decided to pop into  ame 's and see if the lock-ups in  um were accessible . ^ i persuaded  ame ( who was in a very surly mood ) to give me the keys , and went and rummaged around till i discovered them - crumpled in a heap on a very dirty floor in the b-floor lock-up . ^ his  ame is a real state , but it , along with his shirts and waistcoat , were valiantly ( not ! ) rescued by myself . ^ i rang  ame to tell him , and he was really pleased about it , and even more chuffed when i said i 'd bring some of them down for him when i went to  ame . ^ i went to stay the weekend with  ame , and on the friday we found  ame at his punting place and arranged to go to his house for tea on the saturday . ^ that was really nice - his family are lovely - and then we went punting in the dark : great stuff . ^ i had never punted before , and decided - on my first attempt - that i was totally useless at it ! ^ i guess with practice i could be ok . ^  ame was pretty good , and  ame and  ame were practically pro 's! ^ we had a great time - chatting about  ame ,  ame 's " fenlanders " , singing  ame and  ame and  ame songs and generally larking about . ^  ame , stunning , and cunning . ^ so , what am i up to now . ^ well , at present i am printing out some leaflets which i 've been busy designing over the past few days . ^ a friend at church asked me to do it , and i said i would as i like playing on my computer , and also hope to get a bit of dosh out of it ! ^ i am also still responsible for the cleaning of our home ( that 's why it 's a pig-sty at the moment ! ) , and i 'm getting really excited about going on holiday . ^ well , i await with eager anticipation the arrival of your account of your holidays . ^ i warn you ,  ame 's instructions for secrecy had better prove to be worthwhile ! ^ well , printing is finished now , so i 'd better go and sort the stuff out . ^ bye for now , " take care " ! ^  ame ^ ps - are you mad ? ^  ame , silly question - of course you are . ^ why did you ring  ame  ame from  ame ? ? ^ was the microwave a bargain or something ? ^  ame : an extract from  ame  ame 's "  ame abbey " : " as far as i have had opportunity of judging , it appears that the usual style of letter writing among women is faultless , except in  um particulars " ' and what are they ?
