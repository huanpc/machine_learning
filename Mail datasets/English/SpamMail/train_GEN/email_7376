^ do n't worry about it ! 
^ the idea is to attempt the questions rather than hand in perfect answers - otherwise the supervision would be a bit pointless ! 
^ if you 've had a look at them then we can run through them in detail on wednesday , and talk about the course material in general . 
^ i know that the start of term is a hectic ( and knackering ) time - i was there myself &num years ago ... nobody will expect you to slave over your work for hours on end when you 're tired , it 's counter-productive . 
^ if you get time to have another look then that 's cool , but do n't worry if you do n't. 
^ see you wednesday ...
