^ &name , here is a more realistic summary : &num ) we all played with little symbols &num ) some creep came into our conversation &num ) you talked to &name in some weird and unintelligible version of english ( can the scots got nothing right ? ) &num ) the creep called us elitist and cliquey ( sic ) &num ) i agreed on the premise that he cannot spell , and therefore clearly has not been to uni &num ) &name was , i agree , rude , but amusingly and justifiably so ... it 's just a good job &name and &name were n't there . 
^ what is this , i talked to &name in our own language ? 
^ and i do not remember insulting you at any point . 
^ but enlighten me . 
^ i agree too that we should experiment with cocaine ... kidding . 
^ actually , drugs have never had any real fascination for me , but i know they have for &name . 
^ maybe you could slip a little something into her early morning cup of tea to see exactly how hyper she can get ... funny ! 
^ chinese water torture : the chinese would deprive a person of liquid for days . 
^ then they would place them into a room next to which would be an unseen , but audible , dripping tap . 
^ the person would then confess ( hopefully ) . 
^ maybe i could start my own version , placing you in a room surrounded by mess , with an unseen but audible vacuum cleaner next door ... heh heh heh ! 
^ i have nearly finished at the &name ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ &name ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ i am happy . 
^ &name , are you coming to my house for my birthday ? 
^ i would love to see you , and you know my parents adore you . 
^ you could clean my room . 
^ &name boy ... i do n't offer evryone that privilege , you know . 
^ got to go , i 'm going out for a meal with some friends ( yes , i have more than &num ) . 
^ got to get ready ... see you ... love &name xx

^ from : &name ( &email ) to : &email subject : we are " cliquey " - i believe ... 
^ &name : &name , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &num 
^ hi &name , 
^ it was very interesting to observe the psychology of group interactions in marshallbees on sunday evening . 
^ thanks for providing the opportunity . 
^ here is a brief summary of our chat 
^ &num ) we all talked . 
^ &num ) you insulted me . 
^ &num ) i insulted you . 
^ &num ) i talked to &name in our own language ( i.e. och , it sure is dreight the nicht ) . 
^ &num ) you talked to &name in your own language . 
^ &num ) an unknown and uninvited guest turned up , calling himself " &name . 
^ &num ) he was very nasty and called us names , like " elitists and " clicky . 
^ &smiley you corrected his spelling of " cliquey . 
^ &num ) you told him you were delighted to be an elitist if it meant you could spell correctly . 
^ &num ) we all told him to go away and learn to spell and construct grammatically correct sentences . 
^ &num ) &name was quite rude towards him . 
^ this was amusing , and may prove to be even more so if it turns out we knew the unknown guy . 
^ so , are you still well ? 
^ are you still watching 'diagnosis murder every day ? 
^ i watched it today . 
^ i also watched it yesterday . 
^ however , i did n't get up at &num : 15am , tempting though it inevitably was . 
^ today i synthesised penicillin ( on paper ) whilst yesterday i synthesised &name and &name ( on paper ) . 
^ talking of cocaine and opium it could be quite interesting next term if some of our flat-mates came home to find a " cocaine-laboratory set up in our kitchen . 
^ i can just imagine the scene 
^ over the next few weeks subtle hints are dropped that &name is not quite the na 've chemist he makes out to be . 
^ &num morning when &name is checking the post she finds a parcel for &name from , say , &name . 
^ this is curious . 
^ she leaves it in his room and probably thinks nothing more of it , but perhaps she does later that day she returns from her lecture to find the kitchen work-surfaces covered with complex-looking chemical apparatus containing curious tar-like substances that bubble . 
^ there are some shallow glass dishes containing a white powdery substance , just recrystalising from solution . 
^ the parcel is lying on the table , opened , and a lab-coat is strewn carelessly on the floor . 
^ the phone suddenly rings she picks it up to hear a curiously thick voice with a sinister-sounding message for &name . 
^ i do n't know what could happen next , but it may well be very amusing ( ! ) 
^ anyway 
^ " i am not going to plot to kill you . 
^ why would i make it that easy for you ? 
^ i 'm going to do something akin to chinese water torture heh , heh , heh 
^ - okay now i 'm worried . 
^ what is chinese water torture ? 
^ i hope you have a lovely christmas &name and a most enjoyable birthday . 
^ i look forward to receiving a reply , 
^ &name
