^ " surely you know that many runners take part in a race , but only one of them wins the prize . 
^ every athlete in training submits to strict discipline , in order to be crowned with a wreath that will last ; but we do it for one that last for ever . 
^ that is why i run straight for the finishing line ; that is why i am like a boxer who does not waste his punches . 
^ i harden my body with blows and bring it under complete control , to keep myself from being disqualified after having called others to the contest . " &num &name &num 
^ this weeks news is mostly what is below : 
^ risky living thursday 28th nov. &num : &num for food , &num : &num for worship . 
^ our very own &name &name will be speaking on &name , with free handouts ! 
^ this will be the last risky living of the term , so if you have not been before do come along and try it out . 
^ &name is a subject very close to all our hearts and particularly important to have biblical on . 
^ " it is better to be poor but honest than to be a lying fool . " proverbs 
^ 18: &num . 
^ the topic of &name leads seamlessly onto that of money for the houseparty . 
^ pay up now or for ever hold your peace . 
^ " &name people are always finding new friends , but the poor cannot keep the few they have . " proverbs &num : &num 
^ sunday we have a trinity of service at &name &name if you will , &num : &num , 
^ 11: &num and &num : &num with student lunch after the &num : &num service in the &name &name hall . 
^ this will be the last one of term , so do come along and say hi . 
^ it will be a bring and share lunch , so do bring and share . 
^ how ever biblical loaves and fish are , we are looking for a range of foods , this is a chance for the &name &name 's and &name &name among you to shine . 
^ it will be a buffet style lunch , so food which might be a good idea , pizza 's, sandwiches , cheeses , hams , salads , fruits , cakes , etc. 
^ we will provide drink , so there is no need to worry about bring drinks . 
^ we are relying on you though , to be creative .
