^ hi &name , 
^ i 've read the &name et &name paper , but i still think expanding the lexicon will help in this case because of the lack of context in a lot of email data . 
^ for instance , my data contains lines such as the following in various different forms : 
^ &name &name phone : &num institute of modern management . 
^ where the rest of the email probably does n't contain either " &name " or " &name " . 
^ now unless the lexicon contains " &name " as a first name , it is unlikely to be picked up as a name based on its context ( without &name in the lexicon the tagger guesses that it 's an adjective - i.e. a 'sad &name " ! ) . 
^ the 'sure-fire " rules that &name et &name suggest for identifying and propagating ne 's are based on assuming reasonably predictable contexts , which is often not the case in 'messy " email data . 
^ also , it is much easier to simply expand the lexicon rather than do full rule- or pattern-based ne recognition at this stage , and since i feel that recall should be more important than precision in the task of identifying &name 's for anonymisation , i 'm not too concerned about ambiguities . 
^ the tests i have run suggest that over-guessing &name 's is not a common problem even with a significantly pn-expanded lexicon . 
^ i am probably going to turn my attention now to identifying such patterns as " institute of modern management " above which obviously is n't recognised as a name by the tagger . 
^ on the whole though , the tagger is doing well at identifying names - i hope that soon we can bring a webpage online to advertise for more data .

^ people doing &name use things like the &name fact book from the web , but there is a good paper by &name etal &website which points out that context + small list of high freq unambig egs works better than large dictionaries of often ambiguous forms ( e.g. &name - name / invoice )
