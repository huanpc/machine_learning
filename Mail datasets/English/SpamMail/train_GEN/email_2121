" however , it does not come home with me - there are limits ! " ^ - limits to what ? ? ^ would you believe me if i told you i really did n't consider myself clumsy ? ^ yes . ^ we are so often blind to our own little faults . ^  ame  ame , just kidding . ^ those chips belong to  ame ! ^ ( do you want to get me poisoned / electrocuted / guillotined / hugged ? ! )  ame ? ^ - nah . ^ that 's an old one . ^  ame 's already done that . ^ electrocuted ? ^ - maybe . ^ may make your hairstyle rather interesting . ^  ame ? ^ -  ame : with that favoured piece of music playing in the background . ^  ame ? ^ - well , if all else fails , i 'm sure that will be sufficient torture for you . ^ re :  ame charging  ound;  um . . . . . . . ... - i am not amused ! ^ are you saying she deliberately and callously planned the entire thing ? ! ^ how evil ! ^ i said nothing of the sort . ^ all i know of the incident is what you have reported on it . ^ my interpretations may have nothing in common with  ame " intentions . ^ i am merely speculating - and hoping that i 'm right ! ! ! ^ you may have to call an emergency flat meeting to discuss your stategies as to how to deal with the situation on your return to  ame . ^ anyway , i ca n't believe your room is  um degrees  har ! ^ are you sure your clock is working correctly ? ^ - perfectly well . ^ are you doubting the accuracy of my wonderful  ame clock ? ? ^ how dare you ! ^ the fact that it sits next to the radiator may have something to do with the temperature reading - athough my room was incredibly hot until i worked out how to operate the valve thingy . ^ you said you set your clock to count down to term starting . ^ does this mean you want to go back and miss being in  ame ? ^ yes and no. i set it to then as it was the first date that came into my head . ^ analyse that psychologially if you wish . ^ however , i do miss  ame to a certian degree . ^ it 's weird not seeing my friends and hardly seeing anyone all day - everyone is out doing stuff - but i 've had so much to do that i 've not had time to mope . ^ now , i really meant that to be anxious for christmas was the same as to be excited for christmas . ^ sorry if you misunderstood ! ^ - no , i did n't. ^ i just like taking the  ame ( it 's called " getting your own back " for all the times you do it to me ) ^ well , what is men are from  ame , women are from  ame " about ? ^ it is all about men and women and the different ways in which we operate - emotionally and psychologically . ^ very interesting stuff , as i said before . ^ i do n't believe it all , but it 's a pretty good book . ^ what 's your book from  ame all about ? ^ also , it would be cool if you were up near  ame during the holidays ! ^ well , only if it happened to be a day when i was working there ! ^ ( i.e. this wed ,  ame , next mon , wed , and the following  um thursdays ! ) ^ - do n't count on it , but we might . ^ where is the shop in  ame , just in case ? ^ so , have you designed your leaflet to put in the gospels ? ^ yes , it sounds like you 'll be very busy indeed for the next few days ! ^ - you can say that again ! ^ yes , i designed the leaflet on monday afternoon , sent it to the printers , and collected them today . ^ meanwhile , yesterday i printed off  um stickers and stuck them on  um envelopes . ^ this evening , we ( me , mam and a lady called  ame from  ame : note , we were the only volunteers - apart from dad who was on a plane back from  ame at the time , so was of no use to us ) put the bookmarks in the gospels and then put them in envelopes . ^ we then boxed up the right numbers for the blocks of flats around our church . ^ we only finished that about half an hour ago . ^  ame . ^ i 'm knackered . ^ . . ... there was just the most beautiful sunset which i 'd ever seen this evening . . . . . . . . ... every few minutes when i glanced up from my work it had changed into a picture even more beautiful than it had been previously . ^ it was yellow and orange and pink and red and blue and purple and gold . ^  ame is amazing ! ^ he certainly is ! ! ^ did you take any photos ? ^ or have you just got the pictures in your head - stored up in your imagination ? ^ ( to sound like  ame  ame ) . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ so , what else have i been up to ? ^ yesterday i spent the afternoon traipsing round town , getting more and more annoyed at the commercialisation of christmas ( while trying to find presents , i hasten to add ! ! ) . ^ came home empty handed - the shops are full of junk . ^ then , today - joy of all joys - mam was off work ! ! ^  ame ! ^ we took the junk that dad insists on us collecting to the recycling point ( mounds of papers , glass bottles , plastic bottles and cans ) and then went to - guess where ? ^ -  ame ! ! ^ i wanted to collect my internet connection cable from the flat , as well as our " wives and  ame " video . ^  ame would never forgive me if it was n't here when she gets home on  ame ( yippee - she 's home soon ! ) . ^ it chucked with rain just as we arrived in  ame ( what 's new ? ) and so we got rather wet going on a wander to college ( to collect an address list ) and into town ( to get a doughnut from  ame - yum ! ) . ^ how did your shift in the shop go ? ^  ame it was fun . ^ did you sell much ? ^ do you like operating the till ? ^ that was one of the best parts of working at  ame . ^ i love the tills ! ^  ame fun ! ^ i can remember telling the guy who till-trained me ( that sounds really dodgy : like potty-training or something ! ! ! ! ) that i 'd always wanted to work a till : he thought i was barmy . ^ not far wrong there . ^ oh , you can tell when i 'm getting tired as i start being rude to myself . ^ or maybe it 's just that i start being honest with myself . ^ i 'd prefer to go with the first option , but i think it 's more realistic to take the second . ^ so . ^ i have been a busy little bee and am now in desperate need of some sleep . ^  ame . . . . . . . . . . ... ^ "  ame  ame , have fun ,  ame ^ get more from the web . ^ free  ame explorer download :  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
