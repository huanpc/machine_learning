^ fingers crossed that this will work - third time lucky and all . . ... 
^ the idea was to send a themed email , since a remarkable trend came across our travels over the past month or so ... so as planned - in a sesame street stylee , todays email is brought to you by the word big , and the institution discovery channel . 
^ &num in a pl;easant town outside &name in &name we saw a very big tree . 
^ indeed , it is suggested that it is the largest single living biomass on the planet , and over &num yrs old to boot . 
^ it was most certainly a very big tree . 
^ &num shortly afterwards we arrived in &name city , a very big city , indeed the largest in the world . 
^ it is smelly and noisy and crowded but also kinda nice . 
^ ( although full of damn dirty thieving bandidoes - the light-fingered charlatans atytempted to pick our pockets on the tube , but ever vigilant &name crushed their fingers in his pocket and they scuttled away whimpering) . 
^ it is also covered in a very big &name . 
^ whilst there &char ( &name ) tasted the local speciality called mole - not the burrowing near-sighted lovable rat creature but a chocolate and chili sauce which they spread liberally over pretty much anything - a big &name &name in this case . 
^ &num . 
^ in the central square of the big city there flies a very big flag . 
^ mere words cannot describe the enormity of this beast , so i wo n't bother trying . 
^ &num just outside big city there is a set of ancient ruins which include a very big pyramid , indeed the third largest pyramid in the world . 
^ we climbed to the top , and were followed by a stray scratty dog all the way - he followed us round the whole site for hours but then got bored and left only minutes before we had lunch . 
^ muhahahaha 
^ &num we caught the train to creel , from where you can see into the copper canyon - a very big canyon . 
^ indeed , many say it is more impressive than the grand canyon , but we could n't say .. there are some interesting rock formations in the area , which resemble big frogs , big mushrooms and big erect &name ( no really- it 's in the guidebook and everything) . 
^ &name was highly eroticized until he realised the frog wasnt real . 
^ &num in attempting to escape &name , we passed through &name , a very big border crossing . 
^ indeed , it is the biggest land crossing in the world . 
^ getting across involved a very big wait in several big lines - so much for american efficiency . 
^ it was here that &char famously rode a painted donkey ( go-faster zebra stripes) . 
^ also survived the whole of &name without any noticable bowel complaints , which is especially striking when you consider the shenanigans of &name - bought some delicious looking sausage from a supermarket after a woman had plied us with free samples . 
^ sadly , she cooked it and we didnt . 
^ in horror &char discovered this with mouth brim-full - and this was no rrrrrrrraaawwwwwwww meat in a cookey " isnt this belgian breakfast strange yet satisfying " kinda way but more a " oh my god my guts are gonna be burning this is raw mexican meat in the dirtiest city in the wortld " kindfa way . 
^ &name refrained . 
^ &num after the joys of &name , we relaxed in san &name and did the cultural thing - went to hooters , where the barmaids had very big jugs of beer which they were happy to pour for you while leaning over seductively . 
^ &num san &name also has a very big &name , indeed they would like to inform you that it is " world famous " , and do so at every available opportunity . 
^ it is also good , and they have many big animals such as wellyfants and bears and even pandas ( plus bongos of course) . 
^ &num a short trip took us to &name - bright lights big city . 
^ they have far too many big things to mention , including ther &name &name big hotel , indeed the biggest in the world , and big fountains outside the bellagio , which we watched pretending to be &name clooney and &name &name - many approving glances . 
^ &num in &name there is a big sign , which can very nearly be reached after a big walk . 
^ there is also &name 's famous ( yet sadly not overly big - maybe in repute ) cinema , which we patronised - &name being the main feature . 
^ &num in san &name we went to the golden gate bridge , a very big bridge . 
^ slightly wayward navigation by yours truly led us to drive over this beauty &num times . 
^ on the other side we saw more big trees , although not quite as big as big tree , although they are mighty fine . 
^ also drove down &name street which is called the worlds crookedest street by virtue of the large numbers of big bends in the road . 
^ in an unrelated matter of only intermediate size , there is a &name in &name with the worlds only curving escalators , which we have ridden a big number of times . 
^ hopefully this brings everyone more than up to speed . 
^ if you are still awake please write back with a nice caring message .. thankyou . 
^ hope all are well , see you all soon ( ish ) 
^ big love and kisses 
^ big &name and big &name ( so show some respect ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! )
