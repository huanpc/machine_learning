^ this is what i just sent people who receive my prayer updates . 
^ ( if you would like to receive my less frequent quarterly prayer newsletter or my weekly updates , please let me know . ) 
^ as i write , i am in a " people mover " minivan heading back from the spring harvest student.evolution conference . 
^ i am tired , and looking forward to putting on a silver necklace--a simple celtic cross--when i get home . 
^ when the conference began , i was struggling hard to suppress a sort of spiritual gag reflex . 
^ the worship seemed to be about mtv-style showmanship more than the presence of &name ; numerous vendors , hawking their goods , bespoke a crass commercialism . 
^ i started to pray , think , and seek the &name 's guidance , because i knew it would be very easy for me to have a very bad week , and i wanted to choose to have a good week . 
^ i thought about and rejected &num thing i sometimes do , try to observe as an anthropologist would and chalk it up to experience . 
^ before too long , something else was on my heart . 
^ a friend came over recently to talk about a social blunder i had made . 
^ i had been offensively condescending , and he looked at the isolation i feel and gently suggested that if i do not perceive a common bond of humanity , &num cannot help but be condescending . 
^ &name has been a part of my experience , and as i prayed , i met with a very simple challenge : choose not to be isolated . 
^ &name the conference as someone welcomed in , not as an outsider . 
^ let this be a beginning . 
^ i had also been thinking about &num thread of biblical doctrine not emphasized in evangelicalism . 
^ &name throughout the new testament are startling claims about believers : we are of &num &name with the father ; we share in the divine nature ; we are given the authority to become sons of &name . 
^ this thread is developed by the greek fathers and is foundational to the orthodox understanding of sanctification , but evangelicals do n't do as much with the &name 's teaching that &name is working to create in us a grandeur that was not in &name , that he wants to make us gods . 
^ as the worship sessions unfolded , i was able to look on my fellow worshippers as one looking on a company of gods . 
^ that experience was the apex of something else , something broader . 
^ i let go of my isolation , and was increasingly able to look past a real rough point when need be and experience the conference as something intended for me . 
^ on &name sunday , our group went to the all age worship , and at the end of long worship and a long and interesting lecture , the woman behind me tapped my arm and delivered a prophetic word : " you have an immense capacity for love . " i value that for what it says , for its unexpected character , and in particular because it said nothing about my intelligence . 
^ on monday , &name &name ( the pastor who came along and supported our group ) asked a question that sparked a long and interesting conversation : " what is worship ? " my answer was that worship was a superlative love combined with respect : we can and should love creatures with a relative love , but absolute love is reserved for &name alone . 
^ that answer was n't immediately helpful to &name , because he was working to sort out whether worship is an activity at church or the whole christian life . 
^ the discussion did set me thinking as i entered that evening 's lecture--the best i attended . 
^ without trying to encapsulate the whole message , he explored the primary word used for worship in the new testament . 
^ it literally means to come towards to kiss , and in the greek old testament translation used by new testament authors , it can refer to worship , a servant kissing a master 's hand or foot , or a dog licking a person 's hand . 
^ in the new testament it refers exclusively to worship of the &num &name . 
^ when we got back , i asked a question that had been percolating during the lecture : " is this why , amidst other practical instructions , half the pauline letters end with " greet one another with a holy kiss . " ? " they asked what i meant , and i realized i had n't explained explained the other real part of the equation : divinization . 
^ the potential reason i saw for the holy kiss fit in with divinization : &name alone is worshipped and the image of &name is fittingly honored with the image of worship . 
^ the kiss of peace is not only affection ( even if that is also important ) , but a way to recognize the divinization of one 's brothers and sisters . 
^ ( i think my question was a little too far out for them to have ready musings to offer . ) 
^ that is &num major thread in what happened tonight , and because its basic insight is one i would most like your prayer that i carry with me , both sharing in what is common to humanity and respecting my brothers and sisters in &name . 
^ there are other sides to what was going on . 
^ it was good to be in a state of unpressured time and know that others were also without time pressure : one could start up a conversation without wondering , " am i asking this person to eat into his time for _________ ? " there was an absolutely wonderful drama workshop . 
^ there was a group from &name , and i was able to speak with some of those students a bit . 
^ it was a time to be immersed in love , and it was particularly good to see one specific person flourish in that loving community . 
^ &name suggested that i send my postal address . 
^ ( the postal service has been a bit unreliable ... ) 
^ &name &name &name &name 's college &name &name &name &name kingdom 
^ what would i request prayer over ? 
^ there are several things i would ask : 
^ * that i would keep that human and especially christian connection , and that it would become integrated in how i relate to the world . 
^ ( for that matter , that all of us would persevere in the work &name started with us at the conference . ) 
^ * for &name . 
^ i had my first bible study with him recently , and it went very well . 
^ ( we read &num chapters in &num sitting . ) &name holds great respect for the &name and for &name , and i would like to be involved with the &name &name drawing these to full stature . 
^ * for physical distractions and for my work . 
^ during the conference , i was intermittently tired , fatigued , and in pain ; today , i woke up with a crink in my neck which has n't completely gone away . 
^ these did not stop &name from working powerfully at the conference , even from giving me real joy , but i 'm feeling awfully tired now and not energetic to resume work . 
^ ( i 'm running a very slight temperature . ) perhaps this is occasion for more grace ? 
^ * for the possibility of me speaking at the conference next year . 
^ some of the leadership ( friends of &name ) came by because they wanted feedback on how to do the conference for next year , and at the end of a discussion of speakers i mentioned a prior engagement and said i 'd enjoy speaking . 
^ &name said he 'd pass along a suggestion about something to speak about , and i think that if i can identify something beneficial to the conference that i can do well , i 've got a real chance of returning as a speaker--which i would love . 
^ please pray that i would be able to return as a speaker and be a conduit of blessing to the conference . 
^ i have a lot to be thankful for ; work on my thesis went well last week , and the conference was a blessing . 
^ may the &name 's resurrection life fill you all ! 
^ in &name 's light , 
^ ++ &name &name , &email 
^ * * to see an award-winning website with stories , essays , artwork , 
^ * * games , and a four-dimensional maze , why not visit my home page ? 
^ * * all of this is waiting for you at &website
