^ well &name , i managed to fool your howler because this pc does n't have a sound card and therefore could n't play the loud .wav file you no doubt attached . 
^ ( &name , just another reason pc 's are superior to &name ... sometimes it pays not to have sound capabilities :-o ) ) . 
^ actually , i 've tried phoning you , but you were not to be found either . 
^ however , i decided against persecuting you with any howlers , or fluffy &name type retribution . 
^ ( i saw &name &name by the way , he says hi . ) 
^ i will try and phone you sometime tomorrow night , if that works . 
^ alternatively , we could try and organise a time to meet on the net ( you too &name ? ) i could n't get through to &char & &char either , so obviously mum brought lots of swiss chalet sauce back from k-w and they were too busy eating that to answer the phone . 
^ back to the library methinks . 
^ talk to you soon , 
^ &name 
^ &name &name onto the set for &name &name , and steal me some &name .
