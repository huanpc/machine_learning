^ dear &name , 
^ i am bored revising ! 
^ anyway , i just got theis e-mail , and although it is 'scandalously irreverent " , some parts are rather amusing . 
^ see you later , 
^ &name 
^ &name remember to do those exam rules if you have time ! 
^ sipping vodka 
^ a new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak . 
^ after mass he asked the monsignor how he had done . 
^ the monsignor replied , " when i am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit , i put a glass of vodka next to the water glass . 
^ if i start to get nervous , i take a sip . " so the next sunday he took the monsignor 's advice . 
^ at the beginning of the sermon , he got nervous and took a drink . 
^ he proceeded to talk up a storm . 
^ upon his return to his office after mass , he found the following note on the door : 
^ &num sip the vodka , do n't gulp . 
^ &num there are &num commandments , not &num . 
^ &num there are &num disciples , not &num . 
^ &num &name was consecrated , not constipated . 
^ &num &name wagered his donkey , he did not bet his ass . 
^ &num we do not refer to &name &name as the late &name 
^ &num the father , &name , and &name &name are not referred to as daddy , junior and the spook . 
^ &num &name slew &name , he did not kick the shit out of him . 
^ &num when &name was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey do n't say he was stoned off his ass . 
^ &num we do not refer to the cross as the " &name &name " 
^ &num when &name broke the bread at the last supper he said,' take this and eat it for it is my body . " he did not say " eat me . " 
^ &num the virgin &name is not called &name with the &name , " 
^ &num the recommended grace before a meal is not : rub-a-dub-dub thanks for the grub , &name &name . 
^ &num next sunday there will be a &name pulling contest at &name &name 's, not a &name pulling contest at &name &name 's.
