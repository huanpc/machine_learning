^ hi there . 
^ first of all , congratulations on your great program . 
^ i just wanted to ask you a question : are you planning to add support for &name files ? 
^ cause it 's one of the best compression algorithms out there , and &char use it a lot to distribute my files ( can make them 30-50% smaller than &name ) . 
^ i read you were planning to add &name support , and i thought you could replace it with &name ... after all , &name has a free utility to make &name &name , so using &name instead should me more attractive now . 
^ thanks again . 
^ &name &name &email 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ &name ! 
^ platinum - watch &name " &name march &name , live on your desktop !
