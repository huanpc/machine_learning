^ &num ) looking back over ticket selling we are concerned that too many blocks have been in place discouraging people from buying , such as saying strongly that people should n't buy a ticket unless bringing a friend , and also not allowing people to take tickets and pay later ( this certainly prevented quite a few from buying tickets at &name / &name ) . 
^ at this late stage we would suggest that for the sake of filling the venue , even if it does create more admin , you provide tickets , take people 's names , and allow them to pay later . 
^ good points- i still think we need to be encouraging people to bring their non-christian friends as well as to go themselves , but i see there 's still the financial aspect to consider ... i say just keep praying that lots of non-christians come , but perhaps now 's not the time to strongly encourage christians not to come unless bringing a friend . 
^ &name , feel free to disagree ... 
^ as for ticket sales , i 'd have thought it should be fine to take names etc at the &name and &name / bt and trust people to pay later- i 'm assuming this issue is irrelevant for sales at &name ? 
^ &num ) on that front , could you provide an update on how sales are going ?

^ &num ) saturday : please let me know where and when you would like &name to be so that i can liaise with him and meet him and bring him to the right places at the right time ! 
^ if you could do this as soon as possible that would be great , as he wants to know .

^ i 'll get back to you on this- i 'd have thought that if 3.30ish is n't too early to ask him to arrive , it might be an idea for him to come to the chapel then at the end of the rehearsal , to see &name ? 
^ then if we 're having a prayer meeting from around &num , he might like to join us for that ? 
^ then there 'll be time for him to eat and get ready before it all begins . 
^ i 've emailed the tape secs to check that there 'll be enough time 
^ &num 15-7.30ish to sort out recording with him . 
^ &name may prefer to arrive a bit later , so these are only tentative suggestions- i 'll get back to you with something more definate ... 
^ i 'll tell him to wear a suit and
