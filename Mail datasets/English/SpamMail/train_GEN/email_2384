" ^ - i could ask you the same question , but judging from your peculiar patterns of speech the answer would not be very illuminating . ^ "  um hannant heard from  har for many dazs naa , an  har 's a wonnering if you 's ok ? " ^ - yes , i 'm perfectly functionary , but now i must address the later section of the question to you . ^ are you feeling okay ? ^ is the sun getting to you ? ^ "  ame hanging in zee olde scot 's land ? " ^ -  ame , does that mean who is , i.e. wha' is . ^ i presume so . ^ therefore i feel that i am at a loss for words , since  um million ( a guess ) people is probably an accurate answer , but i am in no position to name them all correctly . ^ "  ame still 's remembers zee time we 's a spended in yer hous . ^  ame . " ^ - yes , i really enjoyed that weekend . ^ it was great ! ^ so  ame , you have now finished your mapping project ( fieldwork anyway - i suppose you still have some written stuff left to do ? ) and have spent a week in  ame . ^ congratulations ! ^ i hope you have a really great holiday with your family in  ame . ^ i 'm off to camp on saturday for a week . ^ i 'm a bit worried as i will be leading an " enquirer 's group " for the children , so please pray about that . ^ i 've been quite busy lately with chemistry . ^ what have you been encountering this week in the way of  ame , academic work , fun , or anything else ? ^ i have been spending most of the last week writing my dissertation . ^ i have now completed a rough draft , which ( thankfully ) my supervisor is " pleasantly surprised " with ^ - i 'm not quite sure how to take that ! ^ anyway , i have also been finishing my stone circle in our garden , and my dad is going to plant a tree in it next week . ^ apart from that , i have been indulging in lazy mornings and late nights . ^ very bad and undisciplined ! ^ well , i certainly had a busy day today ! ^ i got up at  um o' clock and caught a train to  ame at  um :  um . ^ after alighting at  ame station i promptly made my way to the library . ^ there i worked ( toil such as only  ame would understand ) until  um :  um , after which i felt within me prognostics of hunger pangs . ^ henceforth i skipped gaily along to  ame 's restaurant of fine foods and procured a high quality lunch . ^ late as it was , the time delay only heightened my appreciation of sumptuous chicken pieces delicately fried in the purest olive oil you know ,  ame only have a bad reputation due to the senior management 's most effective scaremongering tactics . ^ if everyone realised how akin to  ame their delectable morsels were the chief executives would have no where to eat out for dinner . ^ very best wishes , ^  ame ^  ame i 'm still lost on the accent ! ^ - which one is it ? </text_normal></message_body></message>
