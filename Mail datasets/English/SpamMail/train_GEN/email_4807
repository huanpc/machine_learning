^ hi &name , 
^ i am writing to let you know that i cannot give you back your summeries for the last &num papers ( &name , implementing data cubes efficiently , and &name ) because the first paragraph of your summery ( sometimes more ) is identical to the first paragraph in each of these papers . 
^ it was announced in class , on the newsgroup , and on the website that this was not allowed , so by rule these summeries will not appear in the folder that you get when you take the final exam . 
^ please let me know if you have any questions , &name
