^ dear &name &name , 
^ firstly may i say that it is a pleasure to once more do business with your firm . 
^ in light of recent correspondance from your client , miss &name , i am following her instructions to collect her debt from yourself . 
^ the purpose of this letter is to open preliminary negotiations as to the how , when , and how much of the money is to be collected . 
^ the amount stipulated is &pound; &num but we must remember that this has been outstanding for a good many months . 
^ therefore at this stage i feel moved to compassion and will await an offer of suitable recompense . 
^ i hope i need not get heavy-handed with your firm &name &name , as i hold it , and yourself , in the highest admiration - for a money-laundering company . 
^ your sincerely , 
^ &name &name
