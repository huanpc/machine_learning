^ dear welfare officers , 
^ i have put together some of the ideas and comments we had in discussions about creating a " peer supporter " scheme in &name . 
^ these are below . 
^ i think that the way forward with this is for myself and interested welfare officers / others to work on a document outlining the scheme and reasons for its implementation . 
^ so , if you are interested in helping to get this scheme off the ground , could you please reply to this email , and i will put all our names on a list , so we can work together on ideas over the vacation . 
^ cheers

^ &name welfare : &name &name &name 
^ the &name welfare and graduates officer has been researching the possibility of setting up a scheme of peer support within the university , to compliment that of the university counselling service and allow students to access som &char support that is in between that that professional counselling offers and college welfare roles offers . 
^ this came about as a result of the topic bein &char brought up in discussions at welfare officer &name meetings . 
^ &char similar scheme 
^ at &name university there is a peer support training programme to teach students ( and staff ) in welfare positions / pastoral roles how to be better listeners and how to refer on students who are experiencing serious problems . 
^ the training consists of &num three-hour sessions . 
^ skills learned through the training include being a good listener , helping others to feel more comfortable with social , academic and personal relationships , helping others to make decisions without giving advice , and managing and communicating about sensitive issues . 
^ although those trained are set up as an approachable body , the students are not trained to be counsellors . 
^ in order to ensure the student supporters are not acting as ( or are not being asked to act as ) counsellors , students attend compulsory supervision sessions on a fortnightly basis to discuss issues arising from their role &char &char college . 
^ this follow-up supervision is an integral part of the programme and begins once students are trained and the panel is set up . 
^ issues 
^ if &name were to have a scheme for peer supporters , we would want to ensure b3continuityb2 and b3investmentb2 in the peer supporters , this would &name &char that people would have to be recruited onto the scheme in the first or second years . 
^ being trained for the scheme would probably involved a definite time commitment from volunteers during their &name career . 
^ it would also be important that the scheme were to compliment any counselling or other support mechanisms in the university e.g. &name , college counsellors , &name etc , rather than being seen as detracting from what these important services offer . 
^ &char rigorously formal system could not be implemented from scratch ; the schem i will have to develop from small beginnings . 
^ it is a worry that a large number of training hours and commitment for such a scheme might b3scare people offb2 from getting involved , but similarly , if there is no formal training , to a good standard , then there is very little to distinguish the peer supporters from others in the student body . 
^ it is a possibility that instead of concentrating the training on a few individuals in each college , but to train more students , but to a lower level . 
^ such training could be an extension of the parenting scheme or b3hall monitorb2 schemes in colleges . 
^ financing the scheme 
^ costs for the scheme would include those for trainers to initially train students in peer support , as well as possibly costs for ongoing supervision of the supporters . 
^ the scheme at &name university is funded by the college &char according to how many students they have participating in the scheme . 
^ their scheme is run by the university &name service who arrange and lead th &char training , as well as the ongoing supervision . 
^ &char possible scheme for &name 
^ rather than having on-going training , to focus training in &num weekend . 
^ &name i would be a full weekend of training ( starting on the friday evening and finishing on the sunday ) , which would be before the start of term . 
^ there would be a briefer b3follow-upb2 training session then half-way through the year . 
^ e.g. initial training at the start of &name &name , then followed-up a &char the start of &name . 
^ on-going support for those trained would be via structured college-based welfare committees . 
^ this would allow supporters to b3check-inb2 with others &char &char their college and provide a forum for support . 
^ any issues that seemed beyon &char the scope of the group would then be brought to the &name welfare and graduates officer , or to the university &name service . 
^ it is hoped that some of the trainers may be willing to train the volunteer &char without payment , as training is part of a b3one-offb2 weekend , rather than on-going . 
^ however this situation would be impossible to sustain , if the scheme were to b3take-offb2 and continue to develop every year . 
^ in order to present a coherent b3packageb2 of speakers / trainers some assistance in planning would be needed from the university &name service , or possibly the co-ordinators of the &name scheme . 
^ funding for the scheme would otherwise possibly come from the university &name service executive , or from the societies syndicate or from &name university &name " &name . 
^ &name 
^ over the new year vacation &num the &name welfare and graduates officer will draw up some drafts of how the scheme might work , and working with som &char other interested welfare officers and members of the &name executive will come up with some solid proposals to take to the appropriate bodies ( e.g. university &name service ) for discussion . 
^ if discussions and formulating of the scheme go well , then it is hoped that recruitment for th &char scheme would take place in &name &name &num .
