^ hey guys , &name just got a few questions about the restream and union boxes . 
^ i just got a bug report that says restream should only have &num column in which the user can select which attribute to group by on . 
^ can someone explain this to me ? 
^ apparently i didnt really have a healthy understanding of restream when i designed the properties dialog . 
^ also , as far as i can tell the union box does not need any sort of predicate / modifiers &name in the properties dialog because it always performs the same operation on the incoming streams . 
^ is this a correct assumption ? 
^ thanks
