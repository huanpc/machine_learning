^ excellent ! 
^ i ca n't wait to hear this track ! 
^ sorry i have n't been in touch for a while . 
^ thanks for keeping me updated - i hope the ticket sales went well today . 
^ everyone i talk to is being very positive so i think it 's going to be well attended , which would make our job a success and that would make me very pleased ! 
^ in seriousness , i want to encourage you because i think &name 's going to use it in a big way . 
^ poster progress seems to be good . 
^ &name has the flyers now and that also seems to be good . 
^ &name &name has asked for &num posters and 20ish flyers , so if shes at the prayer meeting tomorrow maybe you could pass them on ? 
^ also , i am not going to be able to make the prayer meeting tomorrow ( sorry sorry sorry)- i have a late supervision , and it is my friends birthday and we have booked to go out for dinner . 
^ sorry i have n't let you know sooner , i did n't know whether the meal was booked or not , but it is so sorry ( again ! ) . 
^ i hope the work is going ok - how 's th discrete maths &name ? 
^ my friend &name at &name has been saying she is finding it a nightmare too and she asked a mathmo ( who also happens to be the &name &name national champion ) for help , and even he could n't do it , so be encouraged , and do n't stress . 
^ maths is , by definition , a nightmare ( i should know ! ) , but the uni examiners etc know that too . 
^ anyway , enough ranting . 
^ &name , call me when you get the music . 
^ oh , and about the acetates - had a chat with &name about it and we agreed that i 'd do them before saturday ( bt ) and we 'd give them out then to go up on the monday of the concert . 
^ any news on ticket sales from the box office ? 
^ speak to you soon , thanks for everything , take care , &name bless , &name &char
