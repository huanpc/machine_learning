^ &name , &name &name ! 
^ fit like 's you , the day ? 
^ arrived back home on thursday afternoon , totally knackered with elephantitis of the ankles ! 
^ must be unfit . 
^ my knees gave me a bit of bother at the end of mondays hillwalk but it 's my own fault because i did n't put on my knee supports . 
^ i ken better noo ! 
^ the weather was mixed and rain spoiled what would have been the most spectacular of the &num walks i did . 
^ slippy rocks also contributed to &name falling and that gave me a real scare- shaky for ages after although &name wisna hurt at all , miraculously . 
^ wildlife in &name 
^ v. strange - &char . 
^ curious and bold . 
^ nearly stepped on a little baby deer lying curled up sleeping which i 'll never forget .
