^ that is great news about the houseparty . 
^ i am very pleased to hear that you have found your fishing rod as it were , praise the &name for being able to go on many houseparties . 
^ &name halls address is &name &name , &name , &name , &name , &name &name . 
^ i would suggest that public transport is very limited and that to just come for saturday would not be easy , we have &num students coming down saturday morning and then coming back with everyone else on the coach on sunday afternoon . 
^ they are catching the &num : &num train , contact &name &name &email he is kind of in charge of the organising of the train party , we are then picking them up from the station . 
^ how does that all sound ?

^ hi &name 
^ hope you got my e-mail about the website & found it constructive . 
^ with relation to the houseparty , i 've now found a fish ( metaphorically , i should add ! ) , but i 've kinda made other arrangements around the weekend . 
^ i was just wondering what the public transport is like to whereever it is in &name you 're going ( you could just tell me where it is , and i 'll investigate ) ? 
^ if it is any good , would it be possible for me to join you just for saturday ? 
^ and in case you 're wondering , i 've heard that college are doing room rent bursaries again this year , which i had n't accounted for in my budget , and if last year is anything to go by ( and this year i should get more ) , then i could go to several houseparties on it &smiley 
^ thanks , 
^ &name
