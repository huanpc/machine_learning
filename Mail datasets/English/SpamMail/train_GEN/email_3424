( but strangely enough opening the window does n't help ! ! ) ^ lots of things have happened to me since the end of term but i 'll probably just wait until i see you because non of them are simple enough to put in writing ! ! ^ sound familiar ? ^ take care , see you in a couple of weeks ,  ame </text_normal><text_embedded></text_embedded></message_body></message>
