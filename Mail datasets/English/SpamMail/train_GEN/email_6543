<text_normal> 

^ you may remember a letter was sent out a while ago regarding arrangements in college for the night of monday 16th june ( &name &name night ) . 
^ we hope by now that most people not attending the &name and affected by the clearance of college have managed to find a room for the night , such as arranging to stay with a friend who lives out of college . 
^ the letter asked anyone having big problems finding alternative accommodation on that night to get in touch with &name &name ( &email ( mailto : &email ) ) . 
^ if you have not already got in touch , we ca n't promise anything , but we will try to help you as best we can . 
^ in any case , we need to hear from you by this friday ( 16th ) at the very latest as we ca n't even begin to consider requests for help for accommodation after that . 
^ for the latest news and more information , visit the &name forum at &website anyone wishing to advertise events that they are organising should send the message ( &char ) they want posted to : &name &name ( &email ) . 
^ note : you received this e-mail because your user id is listed on the &name college server as belonging to a student member of the college . 
^ if you are not a student member of &name college , it would be most appreciated if you could e-mail the address below so that you may be removed from the mailing list . 
^ if you have any complaints or comments about this mailing list please do not hesitate to contact &name &name ( &email ) who will be only too willing to help . 
^ thank you .
