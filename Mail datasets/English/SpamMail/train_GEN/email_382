^ hi &name , 
^ yes , sadly 
^ please never start emails to me like that again . 
^ i thought someone had died , or was in hospital or something . 
^ seriously . 
^ this is another generalised email to clog your inbox and generally annoy you by not being personalised in any way . 
^ would i be being very sad to admit that it 's actually the first email i 've received since leaving &name ? 
^ i thought so . 
^ the sight of talking chickens amused me 
^ &name ! 
^ that 's a healthy sign . 
^ now tell me , what do you think of singing sheep ? 
^ &name ! 
^ we 'll get along like a house on fire next year ! 
^ i 'm sorry i do n't have anything more interesting to say 
^ so am &name 
^ hopefully something disastrous will happen in the next few weeks so you wo n't all have to read these dull emails . 
^ thanks for the quote . 
^ i hope you 're all well ... to those of you lucky enough to be jaunting off to foreign places , send me a postcard . 
^ yes , i 'm well . 
^ just a little bored . 
^ yes , i 'll send a postcard . 
^ so , do you like chicken ? 
^ as a food , i mean . 
^ i see . 
^ &name . 
^ me too . 
^ yes , well , most people say that , do n't they ! 
^ &name . 
^ this is a great conversation . 
^ i agree with everything you say ! 
^ &name may it continue . 
^ you may be interested , but probably wo n't be , to know that i am practising cooking for the flat . 
^ no disasters yet , as such . 
^ now , would you like me to paint your room bright pink with green dots , or black with blue and white interlacing octagons , when i 'm down at the flat in a few weeks time ? 
^ i thought so . 
^ see you . 
^ i have run out of words to write down , as i 've just written &num in an email to someone else . 
^ &name [ in ]
