^ hey &name , sorry , &char obviously did n't send my last mail properly . 
^ &char may ahve got the wrong end of the stick , but i was assuming that &name main would buy the &name 's gospels , because we received a acheque specifically for the me which just nicely covered the cost of them . 
^ however , i have not seen an invoice for them to this point .

^ &char quick calculation concludes , i think , that we can have &num for the concert . 
^ i have n't heard anything back from &name yet though , so this all depends on the financial situation as well . 
^ &name - what 's your thinking ?

^ thanks everyone for doing all this , i apologise for not being on the ball myself . 
^ my own thoughts are that it would be great to use the &num that &name has , including the black-covered &num , as well as whatever you can spare from the &num or so that &name has- how many of these do you think should be reserved for the witness cafe ? 
^ how we distribute the gospels is another question- we originally thought it would be great to give out &num to every member of the audience with their programme , but because i was supposed to sort this out much earlier , and did n't get myself organised ( i 'm really sorry ... ) , it does n't look like this will be possible . 
^ although if &name people pass theirs on , there may be enough for all the non-christians , plus maybe the performers too ... ? 
^ anyone have any thoughts on this ? 
^ sorry , i have to dash ... 
^ love &name

^ yes , i would say i have at least another &num in my room , although this does include the &name 's gospels from the " breakthrough " mission of a few years ago and the &num used for last year 's me ( the &num with black , rather than red , covers ) . 
^ but , if you 're happy to use these , as i say , i 've got another &num . 
^ i also have a stash of the blue witness &name cards .

^ i think there may be a possibility that &name &name may have some more in his room . 
^ perhaps , &name , you could let us know when you get this how many you have , if indeed you have any . 
^ also , &name , could you let me know if you have a little stash of blue witness cafe cards which we think were with the pencils which you have now returned . 
^ thanks , &name
