^ hi &name , 
^ could you find out whether there 's a room available to schedule a talk for &name 26th ( or 27th , if necessary but i 'd prefer the 26th ) ? 
^ &name &name , &name &name and &name &name are visiting from &name and want to give a talk to the group , probably about underspecified typed lambda calculus but i 'm not sure exactly . 
^ i guess it 'd be good if we can arrange it for a time when &name &name can come if he 's interested , but if you let me know the options , i 'll email him and &name &name . 
^ ( &name &name will be visiting too , so i guess they 'll have some audience in any case . ) 
^ &name , who is looking after room bookings ? 
^ the reason &name et &name are turning up is to have a discussion about using &name as an interface to their logic - originally i thought it was just going to be &name &char &num plus me , but if there 's at least &num of us , i need to sort out a room for the &num days they are here , i suppose . 
^ &name
