^ hi 
^ thanks for your e-mail and sorry it 's taken a little while to reply . 
^ that 's ok it 's meant i have time to do other things &smiley 
<text_embedded> 

^ so much for doing my project ! 
^ sorry ... 
^ that 's ok it 's now almost finished in rough - now i just need to write it up by hand ... it 's only take about &num hours ! ! 
^ ( are n't there progs that make writing up maths which has fractions with &num lines in it easy ? ? ) 
^ i 'll talk you through each page : &num ) dad 's working on it - i forwarded him the relevant bit of your email and your new version too . 
^ ok , great . 
^ i look forward to seeing what he comes up with . 
^ it 's quite difficult to know quite what to do with it , so he has a nice little challenge there ! 
^ yes i think he felt the challenge ! ! 
^ he says he 's learning how to do grad fills etc 
^ &num ) this may be able to be freed up ( the talk 's not as long as anticipated ) just to have the " by kind permiss " and italics info that 's on &char &num ok but if i do n't want to ( see later ) then that 's easier 
^ &num ) &name 's photo will be scanned tomorrow or thurs . 
^ still need &name 's stuff and &name 's photo i 'm sure i sent &name 's photo . 
^ oh well , here it is again . 
^ have you got &name 's stuff yet ? 
^ if not , i 'll send another " nag " e-mail . 
^ ok , sorry i thought &name was &name . 
^ i do n't have &name 's photo . 
^ &name 's is now scanned but she is wearing a white top in it against a white background so it does n't look wonderful ! 
^ still not heard anything from &name 
</text_embedded>

^ also , if you could ensure that everyone is labelled here with what they are ( soprano , alto .. ) . 
^ " &char ... 
<text_embedded> 

^ &num ) what do i think about putting the &website ? 
^ fine , although if you want to put it elsewhere then feel free to do so . 
^ right ... 
^ &num ) this is what &name gave me . 
^ &char still have to do a grammar re-vamp etc. is it ok otherwise ? 
^ she 's happy to do more with it if it 's needed . 
^ which picture do i think ? 
^ i 've emailed the webmaster of the site i got them off for copyright . 
^ as she 's spelt &name the way she has do we need to do that throughout the &name ? 
^ looks good to me - i 'll e-mail it to &name and check with him ( he 's the musician ! ) . 
^ i 'll leave the picture choice up to you - i have no preference either way . 
^ have you permission yet to use them ? 
^ as for the spelling of &name &name , again i 'll ask &name . 
^ there 's a date mistake on it but i have the correction now . 
^ not had reply to my email on the copyright . 
^ does it matter as they 're ancient portraits and copyright was n't invented then ? ? 
^ &num ) is the centre heading better ? 
^ yes , i think so . 
^ good 
^ &num ) &char need to lose &num lines so do i think i can lose some carridge returns where i 've got &num ? 
^ still have n't decided on borders you could try removing the crs & see what it looks like . 
^ have a play with that one . 
^ you may be able to increase the margins . 
^ get your project done . 
^ then worry about borders &smiley ok , i 'll leave the crs and add boarders and make the text stretch to the end of p14 
^ &num ) this should be freed up for &num / &num it 'd be good to have the contents of &num / &num staying on facing pages if possible . 
^ see above 
^ &num ) does it need a title ? 
^ what about the colons ? 
^ anyone else to thank ? 
^ have we got another trumpet yet ? 
^ alpha order has n't happened for some reason . 
^ ahhhhh ! 
^ it 's ok i 'll do it later . 
^ you get the idea anyway . 
^ &name new &name ensemble i 'll get thanks to you by sat . 
^ trying to find out about the trumpet alpha ordering should n't take you too long & if you could put some kind of seperation between the performers & thanks , that 'd be good ok yup 
^ &num ) i have n't touched this since you revamped it . 
^ my efforts were only experimentational i figured ! 
^ my excitement to look forward to on sunday afternoon ... 
^ &name this gets through to you without any trouble . 
^ i tried to put something on your web space the other day but it said i was unauthorised or something . 
^ anyway , dad 'll send you a zipped pdf version of whatever he comes up with . 
^ yes , it got to me thanks . 
^ forget the web space thing , obviously in your ( your computer 's) case it is going to be more trouble than it 's worth . 
^ hmmm . 
^ either that or it 's just me doing something silly !

<text_normal> 

^ well it finally seems to be coming together ! 
^ i 'll do little things to it but leave the reformatting of p8-14 and &name till sunday pm . 
^ i have n't worked out what to do about printing - whether 'mail boxes inc " or cusu are better . 
^ as far as time to do it goes ( actually printing that is ) i 'm free after &num : &num on tues or all wed afternoon but that 's about the only times next week that i can do it . 
^ i 'm still unclear on exactly what 's needed in colating . 
^ are we stapling them ? 
^ if so do we have a long arm stapler ? 
^ are the sheets being folded in a machine or by hand ? 
^ i 'm sure there 's other things &char wanted to say but i 've forgotten ! 
^ hope ur coping with bringing everything together . 
^ &name &smiley
