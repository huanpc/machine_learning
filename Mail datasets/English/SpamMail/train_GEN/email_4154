^ &name , &name first things first , i was in hospital yesterday having my heart fixed , which when written like that sounds mighteously scary , but i am pleased to that it was n't. 
^ i now have a small coil shaped thing inside me and no blood flow where i should n't. 
^ it was very clever they stuck it in my leg and threaded it up , so no big scar or long hospital stay . 
^ also no general anesthetic so no time feeling sick . 
^ so i can go to work on monday and play football as long as i do n't play in goal ( which is good &name i hate goal keeping ! ) and no rugby tackling ! 
^ secondly , holidays . 
^ what a good idea ! 
^ i would love to go to &name and would be my optimum choice . 
^ &pound; &num is a lot-i wonder if it could be made any cheaper , flying out in the middle of the night is unpleasant but cheap . 
^ &name is normally hot and sunny which is important to me . 
^ i also get sick on ferries , but well i guess i could get over that. ( or fly straight from &name ... ) if we went somewhere nice that would be good . 
^ ( beach ... ) i suppose there is the possibilty of my parents house / cottage in &name . 
^ this would take some persuasion of the parents , but if you want me to try , it would be free and quiet . 
^ it wo n't be warm , there 's not much at all to do , it 's not near the beach and it 's &num hours from &name which is &num hours from &name , so do the maths from your own houses ! 
^ that is some comment . 
^ i hope that helps &name , and the rest of you can feel popular and informed about my life . 
^ actually , work is going &name have been very very busy . 
^ &name has tendonitis in his foot so he wo n't be playing any sport or even running upstairs for &num weeks at least . 
^ it will be a bit of a problem for a sports team member , but we 'll get by . 
^ last week i learnt about buying minibuses and insurance and mots and ohhhh it was exciting , but hopefully we will get the grant we applied for . 
^ i would appreciate it if you prayed especially for this girl called &name . 
^ she is having a lot of problems at home , her parents make her stay off school to look after her younger brothers and sisters ! 
^ and so she is a long way behind with her standard grades . 
^ she is also grounded a lot and so hardly sees her friends . 
^ her mum is pregnant with her 7th kid at the moment and so &name can only guess that things will get harder particularly as they have only have a &num bedroom house . 
^ she is going to soul surviour in the summer with a loving aunt . 
^ she really wants ot be involved in the church in perth but &name she is grounded finds it hard . 
^ &name studying / work / learning to drive * delete as appropriate is going well for you all love &name 
^ &name your free portable and private address on the net at &website
