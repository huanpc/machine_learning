^ this is the workshop that deals with the workshop : how to build , paint and erect set ; where to obtain wood , screws , paint and anything else you could possibly need and , of course , what the tools do . 
^ crucial for anyone who wants to be a technical director , this workshop is actually important for everyone , since most members of a production crew , such as sound designers , set designers lighting designers , and stage managers , will be called in to help build and erect the set for the show . 
^ whatever role you like best , knowing the tools and the workshop will be a very big advantage .

^ the &name theatre 's programmable desk ( a strand &num ) can be a bit of a handful if you 've never used it before , so this workshop is designed to show you what it does and how to use it . 
^ do n't worry , you wo n't be expected to be experts afterwards ; but it will at least show you that it 's not as hard to use as it looks !
