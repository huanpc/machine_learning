^ i assume from dad 's e-mail that it is a &name ml-1210 ? 
^ in which case the actual &name is ~ $ &num which is ~&pound; &num , rather than the &pound; &num you suggest , though it can be bought for less than &pound; &num online , so the saving is not quite so amazing as it sounds , though still not bad ( approx &pound; &num ) . 
^ the extra cartridge is neither quite as good as it sounds either , since by default the printer only comes with a &num page cartridge , rather than the usual &num page &num , so by putting in another &num page &num , they just come up to what you 'd otherwise expect . 
^ yes , this is what it is . 
^ but you know pc world - prices are always higher . 
^ however , after reading the reviews , it seems quite a reasonable printer for the price ( &name ) . 
^ since you already have one up and running , i was wondering if you could answer the following for me : 
^ &num how noisy is it ? 
^ i 've read reports that it is very noisy . 
^ &name says it is quiet . 
^ &num how much does the paper curl ? 
^ it seems to have a full &num degree path and given the heat , i 'd have thought the curl to be quite significant . 
^ how bad is it actually ? 
^ he has n't noticed a problem 
^ &num if you print out a " colour " graph , does the greyscale correctly make the different colours distinguishable ? 
^ yes 
^ &num how long does it take to warm up ? 
^ &num seconds , he estimates 
^ &num i 've seen some reports of spurious dots across pages and missing letters in the left-hand margin . 
^ has this occurred in your experience ? 
^ not once you 've set the margins right . 
^ &num does manual duplexing work ok ? 
^ i 've read reports of paper skew and a black patch at the top of pages . 
^ i do manual duplexing quite a lot , so that 's quite important . 
^ &name has done this without problems 
^ &num . 
^ i 'm told it gets quite hot ? 
^ it is a laser though , so i guess you 'd expect that . 
^ yes it does but we do n't know how others compare .

^ from what i have seen the results look good . 
^ i also liked the idea of a toner saver . 
^ if you like you can look at / try out &name when you come home and decide then .

^ just a few things while i am writing , which you can reply to after the exams if you like but not too long after ! 
^ &num . 
^ when are you coming back ? 
^ we have a seminar day on sat 22nd , so if we collect you that day it would be after 4pm . 
^ sunday is possible but i do n't know when you get turned out ? 
^ &num . 
^ is this a good term for the parents formal hall ? 
^ also / alternatively , can you think of a time when i could bring &name & grandad up to visit / see your room , college etc ? 
^ i have n't spoken to them but i 'm sure they 'd like to . 
^ &num . 
^ i have looked but ca n't find a frame to fit your photo ( &num " &char &num " including mount ) . 
^ all i can think of is &char ) you keep the frame i put it in. not wonderful but cheap . 
^ &char ) you take the mount off and put it in a smaller frame . 
^ &char ) you go to the photographer and see what he sells . 
^ best solution and the reason i mention it before the end of term . 
^ &char ) we just keep trying . 
^ i do n't hold out much hope . 
^ we could of course get it professionally framed but you probably do n't want to know how much that will cost . 
^ &name ( &name ) came today with his girlfriend . 
^ they had been to a wedding in &name and popped in for lunch on their way home . 
^ it was nice to see him and his girlfriend ( &name ) seems very nice . 
^ also today &name phoned ; they are coming on saturday july 13th and staying &num night . 
^ &name the exams are going well . 
^ love , mum
