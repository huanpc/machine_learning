^ hi , i 've looked the very promising screenshots of &name " work : &website 
^ very nice . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'd like to hear the reasoning on what the advantage is to the current dialog ; this one shows all the same functions , only on different &name . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ the major problem with the old &name dialog 's layout , &name , is that it mixes a set of radio buttons with a set of selections ( icon view , kfd via a push button , a combobox , or nothing in the case of " &name " . 
^ if one can get rid of the modality altogether , great ! 
^ then you can put everything in &num dialog ( assuming the required space exists ) and it all make sense . 
^ but if you ca n't get rid of the modality , then you should make it clear what that modality is . 
^ the radio buttons do n't accomplish this given the way the &name dialog works . 
^ &name widgets are n't inherently evil , but they need to be used where appropriate . 
^ &num thing i 'd suggest for this new dialog layout is a top level item in the &name &name &name for " &name &name " . 
^ that is going to be the common case , and should therefore be easy to find , and accesable in a minimum of clicks . 
^ &char also wonder about the naming of the &name ... " &name &name " , " existing documents " , " recent documents " ? 
^ the ok button should probably say " open " as well ... 
^ and again i wonder if this dialog could n't be embedded into the application 's empty main window ? 
^ &char took a look at doing this , and it seems to be a bit tricky to accomplish ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ seems that this is the opposite from what you want . 
^ take a look at how the background image of &name can be configured . 
^ it formerly was all &name ; now everything is in &num dialog . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ this is because we were able to limit the modality of that interface . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ some observations and a proposition for an alternative widget : 
^ for the second pane : 
^ - it looks to me that embedding the kfiledialog is a bit too much . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ at least with all the part of the file dialog turned on in a short dialog with a beefy font ) 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ a search button to be able to launch an embed &name would be great 
</text_embedded>

^ &name uses a document based approuch which means that file navigation is placed in konqueror and not in the application . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ hm ? 
^ then what is &name if it is n't file navigation ? 
^ every application that supports files provides file navigation via the open / save file dialogs ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ to put a &name in the open dialog is not appropriate . 
^ &name 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ it 's a large number of widgets , that 's certain . 
^ the screenshot shows a very short window , though . 
^ if it was taller , things are far less squished . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ for the third pane , the last opened filed should be shown in a list view with the full path ( so you can tell the difference between the document on your hard disk and the bacup on a floppy ) and the date . 
</text_embedded>

^ i good popup could fix that ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ if it could be harmonized with the &name &name &name , that might be even better ... by which &char mean a list view ( as &name mentioned ) and a preview area ... the more similar the different &name look , the better . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ i 'm not a developper but i had a different idea for the the startup dialog &name more elegant , which is extending kfiledialog so you can put 
</text_embedded>

^ trying this mixes &num concepts that should be left apart . 
^ you mix the opening and the creation of a new _docuement_ in &num dialog that is suppost to be only about file-system navigation ( i.e. _files_ ) i do n't like it . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ agreed

^ &name : cross-posting to kde-usability 
</text_embedded>

^ just as a closing statement on what the original dialog was created for ( but until today not yet implemented ) is that the dialog can be a wizard to automatically fill those templates . 
^ for example you could select a fax template in &name and get a page that asks you for extra info to fill the template . 
^ for this reason alone the choice of different &name as a top-level choice seems wrong . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i 'd suggest that the wizard , when and if it arrives , be either a new window that pops up when the user hits " &name " or reuses the same window and simply replaces the &name widgets altogether . 
^ penalizing the usability of the dialog for an as unyet written feature that can be accomodated in other ways seems sub-optimal to me .
