"  miley ^ sorry to hear about your card-and-glue problems . ^ your cards are lovely , though , before the photos fall off ! ^  miley ( and that often happens months later , so it 's only a problem for people like us -- not all your card recipients display your handiwork as long as we do ! ) your stained glass-look sounds intriguing -- i 'd love to see a sample ! ^  ame did n't get beyond the basic rounds at the fencing tournament , but he had a good time and it was a super experience for him . ^ lots of good feed-back from those around him , too . ^ as for email , all  um of us use  ame 's email address -- just put " for  ame " or " for  ame " in the subject and they 'll get their " own " email . ^ and thanks for your prayers re :  har 's mum . ^  ame said she seemed to be settling in ok and certainly enjoyed having her furninture and pictures around her again . ^ the real test starts later today , when  har 's sister returns to ny and she 's on her own in the new place . ^ so thanks . ^ well , back to 'real life " for me . ^ enjoy your week ! ^  ame and the gang  miley ^ at  um :  um am  um /  um /  um  um , you wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^  ame , ^ it was good to hear from you . ^ thanks ! ^ i 'm sorry to hear about  ame 's mom . ^ i will remember her and all of you as well in my prayers . ^ re card , i 'm sorry the glue is coming off . ^  ame ! ^ yes , i did try the photo corners , but the picutres seemed to easily bow out of them . ^ annoying . ^ i keep trying new glues ! ^ to be honest though , i am getting to a stage where i am concidering stopping making the cards , as much as  ame want me to keep on going with them . ^ they take a long time to make , and i think part of me wants to move onto something different . ^ recently , i 've been trying printing scanned in pictures onto  ame  ame , and putting them in thicker card mounts , so as to make almost stained glass window cards . ^ i wish i had some days off where i could just be creative , and not have to worry about the whole " education " thing ! ^ how did  ame get on in his tournament ? ^ fencing university students ! ^  ame ! ^ do he and  ame have e-mail ? ^ keep well ! ^ lots of love ,  ame  ame  ame  ame  um  um  um ^  ame  har ,  ame  ame 's  ame ,  ame 's  ame ,  ame ,  ame  um ^ st.  ame 's college ^  um  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ^ department of geological sciences university of  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
