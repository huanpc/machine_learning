^ from the front of &name &name 's college , go in through the main and walk straight through 1st , 2nd and 3rd court and over the bridge of sighs . 
^ you are now in &name &name and &char staircase is the far right-hand corner . 
^ keep walking straight on basically as far as you can go - you will walk under the arches past the &name &name on your left and a path off on the right ( which leads through to &name ) , but ignore these .
