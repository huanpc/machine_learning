^ hi &name , 
^ i agree completely - there are a variety of ways to implement case statements without restream and moving restream into the aggregate boxes would make this problem more local to these boxes . 
^ i think we need to bring in &name to this conversation - maybe he can think of a reason why we need stream ids . 
^ what do you think ?

^ i do appreciate your email . 
^ in response to your comments , 
<text_embedded> 

^ as far as restream on its own , it is used to make case statements . 
^ but off the top of my head , it ca n't think why we could n't just use map instead . 
</text_embedded>

^ i wonder if there is no use of having a restream to implement a case ( switch ) . 
^ assuming that the stream ids may not appear in box modifiers ( e.g , filter predicates ) , if we are given switch ( &char ) &name &name : do &name &name &name : do &name &name &name : do &name otherwise do &name , a map &char which writes value xi to a new attribute &char whenever ai holds , and a restream which groups by &char past &char , then i guess there is no way to use the stream ids to separately do &name . 
^ i would rather cascade filters having &num outputs for its predicate &char and ~p , respectively . 
^ or as you said , i would use map without restream in some way . 
^ do you agree ? 
^ anyhow , the above example is mentioned in the &name paper and the document &name 's operator revisited " . 
<text_embedded> 

^ but in answer to your question , i do n't think we need stream ids as they are now . 
^ however , even if we move restream into tumble etc. we will still be having the same problem of trying to figure out what values of the group-by attributes we have seen before and having to maintain a history list or concatenating attribute values . 
^ so we still have to solve these problems that i outlined in my document . 
</text_embedded>

^ &website i think it matters only in the body of tumble and so it is not a system-wide problem anymore . 
^ thank you so much .
