^ well , they 'll shortly become &name property as they 've gone under the adm in budget ( we have an income in excess of &pound; &num so hopefully should have &char nough money even to cover to additional photocopying ! ) so i 'll pass them onto &char &name along with other bits and pieces once i have them all . 
^ if at some point you can let me have them so i can put them in my collection for &name , that 'd be helpful , but there 's no rush . 
^ hope you 're feeling a bit better and will keep praying for you , love &name
