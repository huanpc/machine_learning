^ i have just had a tutorial in organic chemistry with an amusing tutor . 
^ it was good fun , although i understood very little ! 
^ however , that 's not important . 
^ i 'm shortly going back to the flat to eat my lunch - lovely chicken with lemon and coriander , noodles , and soy sauce . 
^ i hope you are all having productive mornings , and if you are not , life is about much more than exam revision .
