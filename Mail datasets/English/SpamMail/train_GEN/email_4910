^ hi professor &name , 
^ &name and i have been working without rest until now ( midnight ) on getting the restream box to work but we had to give up in the end . 
^ it turns out that the way the storage manager is set up makes it fundamentally flawed in allowing string types to be stored . 
^ this is going to be an ongoing problem as restream , tumble , etc. all need stream_id which looks like it needs to be implemented as a string . 
^ to be brief , the reason is that the current storage manager writes " nice-looking " strings to the files ( not bytes ) and heavily relies on specific characters ( for instance " ' and " &char " to delimit attributes and tuples respectively ) to figure out where it is in the file . 
^ &name and i thought we could fix this by rewriting parts of the storage manager , but it turned out that the problem was more deeply rooted that we thought ( for instance it uses strlen and strcat functions frequently which get thrown off by extraneous " &name . 
^ i am sorry we were n't able to get it to run , but i hope that the demo will still be " non-trivial " with complex predicates and functions that go with filter and &name . 
^ i am too tired to make the list of things to do now - i will write it down in the car on the way to providence tomorrow . 
^ we plan to get there in the morning to help out with any last minute testing and ( hopefully not ) bug fixing . 
^ &name
