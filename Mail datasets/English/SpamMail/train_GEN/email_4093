^ &name , 
^ we are looking forward to seeing you next weekend . 
^ since you are coming friday afternoon and leaving mon morning , i wonder if it would be more sensible for you to travel between &name and &name by train . 
^ i do not think the connections are too bad and it could avoid traffic congestion . 
^ let us know what you think is best . 
^ good luck with all the work and the test . 
^ love , dad
