^ hi &name and &name , 
^ we just wanted to let you know that we are still willing to write the type-checking and type-inferencing code if you want . 
^ the way we see it , in order to do type-checking , we will need to create &name objects corresponding to each class that is created on the server side ( &name , &name , etc. ) - meaning that we will have to update your parser to output these objects in a tree . 
^ once we have created these trees , we can get the type returned from every created function as use that to inference tuple types on the output ports of the boxes ( so we would need to edit your box code as well ) .
