" ^ - insolence , and lies . ^ you do not have any economics files , so how could they have been organised months ago . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )i 'm sorry you ca n't read  ame 's web-site can your computer do anything ? ^ (  har </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ suspect you are heating up violently after reading that insult did it hit the bone ? ) " ^ - no , not at all . ^ just laughing hysterically and feeling nothing but pity for your pc- and microsoft-infested brain . ^  ame are cool . ^  ame rule ! ^ it 's just that microsoft have duped the entire world into using their lousy packages , which the do not have the common curtesy of producing in such a way as to allow imacs to read them . ^ incompetence and downright discrimination . ^  ame contain the software to convert it 's files to microsoft formats , but microsoft are not generous enough as to provide the same facility the other way about . ^ cheek . ^ but then , what can you expect from a huge multinational company that cares little for individual 's needs and wants , but is only interested in making it 's billions ? ? ^ ok , there ends the lecture . ^ moving on . ... </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " ) atomic clocks - the sequel is currently under editorial comment .

" ^ - yes , i can imagine the joy . ^ you 'll be able to sleep easy now , knowing that you 've no gaps in the curtains and do not run the risk of infection from the old one 's filthy germs . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )2d  um dimensional flat , as opposed to  um . ^ i.e. the flat </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ people got it ? " ^ - yep . ^ very clever . ^ you have the oddest type of logic though . ^ you can think of things like that , and then still fail to see where " little miss  ame " comes in ? ^ see later comment . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )what is most disturbing is that none of them </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ seem to realise the need to store the vinegar in a container . ^ they all ask what 's wrong with the bottle ? ^ imagine ! " ^ - explanation required . ^ what is wrong with the bottle ? </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )so , who is little miss  ame ? ^ i 've lost you there . " ^ - does your innocent and childlike brain not recall this from your last e-mail ? : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ a message from  ame  ame ; oh , by the way , i would treat reports of  ame frying ravens ( or whatever it was ) with very great suspicion . ^ let us not forget that she has attempted to trick us in the past ( and failed ) and very likely will try again . ^ i 'm sure if there was any danger to  ame himself , his ambassadors would have her eliminated before you could say  ame 's claw . ^ - i was trying to be funny . ^ obviously did n't work . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )by the way , have you ever heard of microwaves being un- </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ nutritious ? ^ since you studied  ame  ame i thought you might be the one to ask . " ^ - as far as i am concerned , it would be a most un-nutirtious diet if you tried eating the parts of a microwave - not to mention un-healthy for your bank account : dental bills would go through the roof , unless of course , you scrounge from the  ame . ^ if , however , you were referring to the food that you cook in a microwave , rather than the machine itself , then my answer is : no idea . ^ we do n't have a microwave at home , so i would n't know . ^ we did use microwaves at school when cooking ( to soften the butter and the like ! ) , but as far as i am aware , we studied nothing as to the nutitiousness ( if such a work exists ) of microwaved food . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )have you got your telephone organised yet ? " ^ - no. i 'm not bothered about linking up either , as i can communicate by e-mail or mobile quite happily . ^ our phone seems to have vanished from the flat too , so i 'm not quite sure what 's going on . ^ " )it costs about  ound;  um for the line rental for  um months . ^ " ^ - how scandalous ! ^ i am currently trying to sort out painting our flat . ^ i 'm not bothered about my room , as the colour is ok , but i really want to cover up that dismal peachy colour in the sitting room and corridor . ^ have you any idea about how i 'm supposed to get hold of paint etc ? ^ my flat mates are either not responding to my pleas or do n't know ! ^ i guess i 'll just ring up college on monday and ask them . ^ so , what have i been doing ? ^ not much . ^ practising pool , netball and football in the church hall ( it 's great to have a free sports hall to practice in ) . ^ trying to learn some tunes on the piano - with only moderate success . ^ cleaning the house . ^ ironing mountains of clothes . ^ scanning millions of photos onto my computer . ^ etc. . ... ^ oh , i saw  ame the other day , and you wo n't believe what he was up to ! ^ we were out at  ame bay and  ame on wednesday , and as we sat in the car eating our picnic ( the scots had sent rain to bother us for the day ) , i saw  ame fly past . ^ he made as if he was going to land on the grass beside our car , and suddenly lunged to the left towards an unsuspecting seagull ( hip hip horray ! ) and proceeded to maul it . ^ i knew  ame would agree with me that seagulls ( as well as pigeons ) are horrific creatures . ^  ame old  ame ! ^ he was good enough to let his victim fly away though - so he did n't absolutely kill it . ^ since then , i have n't seen  ame in the flesh ( or the feathers ) , but spotted him on the  ame 's costume drama "  ame  ame " , which i rewatched on thursday and friday . ^ he does a good old  ame sqwark too . ^ speaking of  ame 's guest appearances , he also featured ( in name only ) in the film " you 've got mail " . ^ when  ame  ame is stuck in an elevator , he dials for help and says "  ame  ame " ! ! ^ amazing stuff ! ^ i await with excitment his starring role in " the emissary " , which i have yet to see . ^ i noticed in the paper today that tomorrow 's episode of voyager is the last in the series - are you sad ? ^ i have n't seen any of it , of course , as we have no telly , but i guess you ,  ame and  ame have been watching it . ^ well , better go . ^ have a nice weekend and do n't get too wet out in the border hills - you sheep . ^ from  ame ( bark , bark . ) get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . ^ share information about yourself , create your own public profile at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
