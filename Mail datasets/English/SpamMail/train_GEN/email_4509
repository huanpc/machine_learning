^ hi &name , 
^ are you working hard ? 
^ what 's the weather like in &name ? 
^ i have n't really had a chance to do any serious rollerblading yet , because it 's too cold and dark in the evenings ! 
^ come next term though , i 'm sure they 'll receive more use . 
^ though i think i 'll avoid trying to go shopping in them ! 
^ &name &name was absolutely freezing ! 
^ i was outside for the first &num and a half hours , and i have n't been so cold for a long , long time . 
^ i was reduced to stamping around like some &name &name , just to keep the circulation going in my feet ! 
^ still , it was worth doing i think - nice to do something totally different every now and then , even if it 's a bit painful at the time . 
^ i got home at about &num : &num , and have never been so pleased to go to bed ! 
^ are you planning on going to any of the &name balls ? 
^ you 're still working at &name 's are you ? 
^ how long are you there for ?

^ yeah , maybe you 'll end up working at &name or something ! ! 
^ &smiley 
^ i 've told &name to look out for you on sunday . 
^ i might even come myself . 
^ cheerio !
