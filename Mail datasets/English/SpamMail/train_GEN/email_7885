^ hi &name & &name : 
^ our free month is up with &name and we 're going to dump it . 
^ the free internet from &name &name seems to work okay but we do n't know if the e-mail works . 
^ i sent you both e-mail last weekend from the new internet provider but not sure if it 's been received . 
^ i 'm beginning to wonder if it only works within certain areas . 
^ anyway , if it dose n't work i 'll try hotmail for a month and see how i like it . 
^ the new e-mail address is &email or &email . 
^ will try and phone you this weekend &name and will phone you &name when i get your phone number . 
^ &name was working this morning but stopped in at the " corner " to see &name getting grubbed . 
^ the weather here has cooled down this past couple of days , but is nice and sunny and perfect autumn weather . 
^ will talk to you shortly .
