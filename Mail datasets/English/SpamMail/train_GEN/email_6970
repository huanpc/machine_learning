^ due to the fact , that the command line compiler not really runs in command line , but runs a little 32bit app in windows mode , it asks for confirmation , when the destination .exe-file already exists . 
^ the php-script however ca n't react to this dialog-box ( overwrite / cancel ) and it 's just not creating a new exe-file . 
^ i just want to ask you , if it is possible to provide a command line option , where i can tell the script whether to overwrite the destination exe-file or to cancel the operation ? 
^ i would appreciate a short response . 
^ &name , &name reproducibleon how to &name is obvious . 
^ &name above &website already exists ! 
^ overwrite / cancel ?
