( dun ,  ame  ame ! )  ame  ame ! ^ well , now i 'm back at college , and once again , the new year has started with . ... new year 's day ! ^  ame , what a surprise ! ^ any way , it is good to be back here at  ame 's, to see my friends again . ^ it 's surprising how quickly deep friendships are formed , and how much you mature ( or at least change ) in  um term away from home ! ^ it was surprising to see what i thought of the people at my old school in the holidays , as i returned to  ame in time for the  ame service which  ame road ( my ex school ) puts on . ^ i enjoyed singing in the service , but i could n't help thinking how young everyone looked ! ^ this is even more surprising as at college , the age differences seem to completely disappear . ^ for example , while most of my friends are in my year , many are at least  um ( i 'm  ame and many of my other friends are in third year ! ^ i suppose one of the observations i made this holiday is that at school , more of the girls wear makeup , but at college , there are a few , but it is harder to keep the " perfect look " ,  um hours a day ,  um days a week for your friends . ^ i ca n't say that 's a bad thing ! ^ ( after all we 're all human underneath ! . ... ( the concealer , blush , and mascara ! ) ) ^ how on earth did i get on to talking about that ? ! ^ anyway . ... it was really good to talk to you around christmas , and thanks once again for the wood . ^ i 'm sorry to say that i did n't have time to turn any bowls in the whole holiday , but ( dramically)' fear not ! ^ they shall be used ! ! " ^ i 'm in the process of looking for a house for next year . ^ i really did n't know what a trouble it would be . ^ i was going to share house with a couple of friends (  um was going to buy the house ) but the  um which were affordable were at least a mile and a half away from the city centre , and about  um miles from our other friends ! ^ other options are renting , or living in a  um person flat for the year . ^ but  ame is a weird place for houses , and other things . ^  ame towns are relatively cheap to live in , as a general rule . ^ however , the university wants to be very similar to  ame (  ame , and  ame ) somehow this has affected the town in that  um miles outside  ame , you can buy a house for  um people for  ound;  um ,  um , but when you come into the city , the same house would cost  ound;  um ,  um ! ^ it really is crazy ! ^  ame ! ^ anyway ,  ame has started again , although i missed yesterday 's practice as i was house hunting . ^ i look forward to killing people again ! ^ photography is still going strongly , i spent about  um hours in the darkroom the other day , and ended up with not very good results , and a really weird feeling stomach . ^  ame ! ^ again ! ^ oh well , practice makes perfect ! ^ i think one of the nice things about the holiday was that i had some 'down time " , which does n't seem to happen at university . ^ it is really nice sometimes to just veg in front of the tv and eat far , far to much chocolate , and other wonderful foods . ... like pringles ! ^  ame ! ^ another good thing was seeing the family . ^ while being at college is fun , you sometimes forget to miss the family , and it is only when you go home you realize how much you actually did miss them . ^ ( and all the annoying habits ! ) i believe one of the most apparent things which i noticed when i went home was that unlike college , i could n't just do what i wanted , when i wanted , but had to " fit back into the family structure " ( my , it is a shame i ca n't do voices on e-mail ! ) ^ ok , well i think i really must go now , optical mineralogy beckons , and i must answer the call . ^ so long , guys ! ^ do you  um families still find the time to meet up during the year ? ^ do take care  ame  ame and ^ love from  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
