^ dear &name , 
^ excuse me - but you received that e-mail from &name , not me . 
^ i asked him to write you an entirely different reply . 
^ however , i will still try and help you , although i must ask you to retract your accusation that i am best friends with a computer . 
^ it is causing me great pain and the emotional scarring is likely to be deep and long lasting . 
^ &num ) i assume you are referring to &name &name &name , the service on the &name &name ? 
^ &num ) there ought to be no problem in creating an independent address list to that of you directory , but unfortunately there is . 
^ &name &name does not seem to remember the address list you create , so you seem to have to re input it each time you log on to a networked pc . 
^ this is extremely tiresome , but until the its fix the problem i know not of any solution . 
^ perhaps our &num technically minded friends will shed some light on the situation . 
^ &name
