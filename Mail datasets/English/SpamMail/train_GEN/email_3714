^ &name &name , 
^ thanks for the personal note . 
^ glad to hear you had a good holiday season and are doing well otherwise ! 
^ yes , i suppose the " rumors " are true , in intention , if not substance . 
^ presently i am trying to light a fire of inspiration towards a new book , trying to sit still , push pencils around , hoping something will catch up to me and make itself known . 
^ mysterious business this . 
^ ca n't force it , yet you ca n't just expect things to happen on their own . 
^ as with most things , faith is an important element . 
^ since you 've asked , the screenplay is more or less on hold . 
^ my cousin 's boss finally read it last summer and said that though he saw the potential in it , he wanted to see more 'magic " , a la &name &name . 
^ that 's easy for him to say , would n't that be nice , i thought , but this is n't about an english boy with a magic wand ... not by a long shot . 
^ anyhow , i have n't felt like rewriting it since . 
^ which is not to say i wo n't in the future . 
^ i 'm certain i will , just not now . 
^ meanwhile i remain fit and healthy and in good spirits . 
^ i alternate running and weightlifting &num days a week ( with the sabbath for rest ! ) and have regained my high school physique . 
^ not bad for an old man . 
^ i 've also kept my hands busy with indian &name this year i produced a deluxe steersman 's paddle and an elegant bentwood chest , painted and carved . 
^ wish i could join you in the bw photography . 
^ miss it . 
^ take care &name . 
^ give my best to your folks , too .
