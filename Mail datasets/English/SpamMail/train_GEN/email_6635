^ thank you so much for your kind assistance . 
^ i was mysteriously successfu &char in removing the program prior to receiving your e-mail . 
^ however , i wil &char keep your instruction for future use . 
^ i really do appreciate the time you spend to respond .

^ i 've tried unsuccessfully to remove the program . 
^ now i get this &website . 
^ to locate the file yourself , click &name . " 
^ can you please help me completely delete this program ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that seems quite a bazaar message for &name &name since it should never be trying to load the setup file on startup and hence i suspect that the problem is that some virus has hijacked the setup file which it found on your computer and has been trying to run itself on startup but failed along the way . 
^ the first thing i would suggest therefore is that you ensure you have an up-to-date virus &name running on your computer , perform a system scan and run the &name ckeck tool available from the &name site ( &website ) . 
^ after that , the issue is how you stop it producing this message . 
^ again , since such a thing should not come up , &num cannot help you by being able to tell you exactly where it lies . 
^ the following may help however : 
^ &num bring up the find files dialog ( &name search or find files from the start menu ) . 
^ &num search for files named " * .lnk; * .pif' ( without the quote marks ) which contain the text &name " ( again without the quote marks - you may have to go to the advanced &name for this , depending on your version of windows ) . 
^ &num delete any files that come up ( send to the recycle bin , rather than a permenant delete , since then you can get them back if you delete the wrong thing ) . 
^ &num if your problem is still not solved , you need to go into the registry and make changes there . 
^ if you do not know what you are doing then this is slightly risky and you may want to get a friend to help you with this . 
^ &num &name run from the start menu and type 'regedit " ( without quotes ) into the box and hit ok 
^ &num &name find from the &name menu and type &name " ( no quotes ) into the box and hit ok . 
^ everytime it finds an instance of it , press the delete key once and hit yes to confirm . 
^ press &name to continue searching until you are told that it has finished searching the registry . 
^ that _should_ be it ! 
^ let me know if you need further assistance , 
^ regards , 
^ &name cornish author of &name maker
^ get more from the web .
