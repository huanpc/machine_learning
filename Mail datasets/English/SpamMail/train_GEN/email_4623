^ error in init file : file error : " &name open load file " , " tdl-mode " is there anything i can do the errors ? 
</text_embedded>

^ yes . 
^ you have the line 
^ ( load " tdl-mode " ) 
^ in your .emacs file . 
^ get rid of it and the errors go away . 
^ slightly more helpful answer : i do n't know what tdl-mode is supposed to do , i presume you do . 
^ you need to find a file called tdl-mode.el &website and make sure it is on your load path .
