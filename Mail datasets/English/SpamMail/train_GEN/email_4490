^ have you actually replied to an email ! ! ! ? ? ? ? 
^ no , only joking . 
^ still , i did n't quite buy the " i did n't know it was you " thing as regards the voicemail - how could you possibly not recognise my supremely distinctive voice ? ?

^ hey hey you of little faith ! 
^ i did n't reply to the voice mail becaue you did n't say who it was - thus leaving me to work out and was only confirmed last week , because you said you 'd ring again on it and because us working people are busy . 
^ anyway , i will phone you , in order to heap bruning coals on your head for complaining . 
^ replying to email is also harder when your working . 
^ anyway , the up thru the leg thing did n't really feel weird . 
^ i had local anesthetic so i would n't feel the wound sight and every thing else was normal . 
^ they had to inject dye to see whether they had stoped the abnormal blood flow and the dye makes you feel really hot all over , but apart from that everything was normal . 
^ i have a multicoloured buise on my groin which is going to make volleying a little painful tomorrow , but i ca n't compain . 
^ i guess you will have some good bruises to sow for your weekend of sport too . 
^ love &name 
^ &name your free portable and private address on the net at &website
