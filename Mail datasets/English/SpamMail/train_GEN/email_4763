^ you were right about the newline &name - it is now running the script . 
^ however , running the script with an absolute path seems to mean that it does n't recognise any of the standard commands , such as " rm " , " cat " , etc. 
^ the script in question is a cascade of about &num shell and perl scripts , and i 'm hoping i do n't have to go through all of them and add absolute paths to every command . 
^ sorry to bother you again about this . 
^ regards ,
