^ &name : 
^ glad to see that you have settled in and hope you are enjoying your new abode . 
^ how is school going , your dad tells me you are very busy with your studies . 
^ not too much excitement around here . 
^ we were in &name for the weekend a couple of weeks ago . 
^ i was at a function for work on the friday night and &name had obtained hockey tickets from one of his suppliers on for the saturday night . 
^ the hockey arena just opened this year and is quite the place . 
^ you could order drinks or food at your seat , the server keyed the order into a sort of laptop and by the time you had paid for it another server was there with the order . 
^ i usually do n't enjoy hockey that much but i quite enjoyed it this time . 
^ i even got some christmas shopping done . 
^ the weather was great last weekend , we were sitting outside with short sleeves both saturday and sunday . 
^ a lot of people were wandering around with shorts on . 
^ yesterday it turned into a howling gale with rain which turned into snow . 
^ it snowed all night and has snowed all day today . 
^ what a change . 
^ all my winter clothes and especially my boots are in the &name . 
^ i guess i 'll have to retrieve at least some boots tonight . 
^ we 're going to a wedding on saturday , which should be quite good . 
^ just hope the weather improves by the weekend . 
^ i guess i 'd better get back to work . 
^ &name sends his regards . 
^ love
