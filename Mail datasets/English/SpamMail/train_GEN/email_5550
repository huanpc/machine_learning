^ dear &name 
^ due to the state of the &name after last guest night please be aware of the following : 
^ - the powers that be in the college were extremely unimpressed with the mess in the &name on wednesday morning . 
^ this will not help our case for the redecoration of the &name . 
^ - the bedders do not clear up after &name &name . 
^ this means that it comes down to the people on the committee . 
^ we spend a considerable amount of time organising things for the &name , and do not appreciate having to clear up after you on top of what we already do . 
^ please try and keep the mess to a minimum . 
^ thanks &name
