^ trying to recover from the shock of you taking care of &name and &name ... still trying ... &name , that 's better . 
^ sorry for taking so long to respond - i did n't get back to &name until late last night , and then slept half the day today away with jet lag . 
^ you 're going to laugh , but i do n't have a dedicated &name connection at home ! 
^ so when i stay there i have to use a slow computer with a slow modem to access the &name . 
^ so where are we staying ... or is it a surprise ? 
^ anyway , thanks for getting that all sorted ... i was going to try to do that today or tomorrow . 
^ it sounds like all we have to do now is reserve a cougette thingy for the night ride to &name and we 'll be all set ! 
^ &name ! 
^ by the way , i brought the rail passes back to &name with me &smiley 
^ i only got &num email from you besides the one you sent today . 
^ did you send more ? 
^ maybe the other email you sent with advertisement for your show came back to life and is stopping other emails from getting to me . 
^ it 's probably being a bitch and saying that it was first in line , so if it ca n't get to me then nothing can ... and eating the rest of your emails .
