^ dear &name , 
^ you expressed interest in directing in &name at the freshers " fair . 
^ it would appear that the sign-up sheet for interviews to direct the &num freshers " &name was picked up .. possibly by &num of you ? ... at the fair . 
^ i 'm afraid this means that we do not know who signed up for interviews at what times . 
^ if you are interested in directing the freshers " shows ( see below for more information ) could you therefore either email me ( &email ) , letting me know your avaliability tomorrow and saturday , or come to the &name squash in the &name theatre bar tomorrow ( friday ) from 4-6pm . 
^ the interview time you signed down for previously has become obselete . 
^ we will put copies of the &num scripts - &name &name 's " peace in our time " and &name &name 's " good fun " - in the &name &name ( underneath the theatre bar ) on the mantlepiece . 
^ please feel free to come and read these at any point from the squash tomorrow but do not remove them . 
^ you do not need to have read the script before your interview . 
^ if you have any questions , or if i can help in any way concerning the freshers " shows , or directing in &name generally , do get in touch . 
^ many thanks , 
^ &name &name , directors " rep .
