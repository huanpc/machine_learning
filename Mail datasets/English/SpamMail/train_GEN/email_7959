^ whenever i am stressed out , i get a package of plain &name 's . 
^ i make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of candy as a species . 
^ to this end , i hold &name duels . 
^ taking &num candies between my thumb and forefinger , i apply pressure , squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters . 
^ that is the " loser " and i eat the inferior one immediately . 
^ the winner goes on to the next round . 
^ i have found that , in general , the brown and red &name 's are tougher , and the newer blue &num are genetically inferior . 
^ i have hypothesized that the blue &name 's as a race cannot survive long in the intense theatre of competition that is the modern candy and snack food world . 
^ occasionally , i will get a mutation , a candy that is mis-shaped , pointed , or flatter than the rest . 
^ almost invariably , this mutation proves to be a weakness , but on very rare occasions , it gives the candy extra strength . 
^ in this way , the species continues to adapt to its environment . 
^ when i reach the end of the pack , i am left with &num &name , the strongest of the herd . 
^ since it would make very little sense to eat this one as well , i pack it neatly inside a tissue , then in an envelope and send it to &name &name , a division of &name &name , &name , &name &num &name , together with a &num &char &num card that reads , " please use this &name for breeding purposes " .
