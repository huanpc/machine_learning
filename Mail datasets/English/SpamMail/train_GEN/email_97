^ &name has just informed me that the race distances for saturday are &website for women . 
^ although these distances are quite long , they are very similar to varsity match distances . 
^ i therefore feel that at this stage it would be useful to get used to running for this length of time , as then when it comes to the varsity matches they will simply seem like a jog in the park . 
^ see you saturday
