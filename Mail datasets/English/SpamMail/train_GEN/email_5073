^ after people move to the &name &name building , there will inevitably be a delay before personal workstations can be recommissioned . 
^ in order that people are not totally out of touch , a temporary workstation room has been set up . 
^ this is in room &name , which is the second office on the right as you enter the central ground floor corridor from the 'street " . 
^ there are &num &name workstations which any user with a &name account should be able to log into . 
^ people who need windows should use rdesktop to connect to &name . 
^ i do not expect people to establish themselves and do serious work in this room .
