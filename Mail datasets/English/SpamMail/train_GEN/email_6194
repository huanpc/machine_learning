^ hi &name , for once , this is n't about the concert ! 
^ i 've got a 'de-brief " thing this evening after the ht service ( &num ) in the &name &name hall , about &name and for everyone else who 's had a bursary from the &name trust this summer . 
^ but it 's also for anyone else who might be interested in overseas missions and would like to hear from some people who 've done things like that this year . 
^ could that be you ? 
^ even if not for yourself , for other people in &name who you could pass info on to ? 
^ i know it 's short notice , every time i 've seen you it 's been about the concert , so i just forgot to ask before- sorry ! 
^ but if you 'd like to come , let me know or email &name &name &name and i 'll see you there . 
^ if not , see you tomorrow at &num , &name i may even be able to make my own way to your room &smiley &name bless , &name
