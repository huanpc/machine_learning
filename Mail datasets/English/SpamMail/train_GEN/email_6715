^ hi 
^ &name it is proving slightly more of a challenge than i expected because of the new server gui stuff . 
^ since i 'm going down today and wo n't have a proper working system until my new computer arrives towards the end of the week , it will be a few days before i get to look at this again . 
^ just thought i should let you know that . 
^ regards , 
^ &name
