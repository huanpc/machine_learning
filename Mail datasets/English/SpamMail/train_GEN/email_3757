^ dear &name , 
^ i assume that you have made the usual &name / &name ( whichever funding body geology comes under ) applications ? 
^ the deadlines are usually april / &name time . 
^ they are your best bet , short of applying directly for industrial sponsorship to the bps of the world . 
^ i would have thought the department would be much more clued up about the latter .

^ hi &name , 
^ something very bad has happened in that the british geological survey , who very going to fund the digital mapping phd that i was going for ( remaining here in &name ) , have had a &num funds cut and so have dropped the project . 
^ this has not made me happy . 
^ i went and talked to the main supervisor the other day and he said that if i can get funding by other means then he is still more than willing to go ahead with the phd . 
^ do you know any funds , companies etc ( probably in the geoscience area , but maybe just nice cross-atlantic companies ? ) who would want to fund a phd ? 
^ i 'll attach the basic summary of the project below ... with regards to funding does it help that i 'm british , american and canadian ? 
^ humm . 
^ i really hope that there are some bodies that want to fund this , as it is a really interesting , and very cutting edge ( technologically speaking ) &name not your standard isotope job . 
^ i hope you can help . 
^ thanks , and i hope you have a great &name !
