</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ hmmmmm. do i think this 
<text_embedded> 

^ is a good thing ? 
^ is there actually any good thing that would fit ? 
^ unless you 're offering me a spanish hot dog then me thinks you 're insulting me .

</text_embedded>

^ - name is &name 
^ - maybe french 
^ well , thats me done . 
</text_embedded>

^ well done . 
^ i 'm not sure what the point of this exercise is , but ... 
^ &name : 
^ - appreciable language ( linguistics ) knowledge source 
^ - &name to make sure people * understand * their practicals but ... 
^ - has funny little goatee you can stare at instead of listening too hard 
^ ( you missed that out of the features ... tsk tsk ... ) 
^ your turn . 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name : 
^ - will further the cause of language ( linguistics ) knowledge which * must * be a good thing 
^ - makes everyone a little bit more happy because he does have what is actually quite an amusing name 
^ - must make some woman very happy with that goatee of his 
^ so now , &name has quite a comprehensive fab .

^ it turned to alcohol after i had an affair with the machine at work . 
^ for some reason it blamed itself , even though i insisted that it was nothing to do with the size of the &name on the graphics card . 
^ we tried a fresh start ( installing the latest version of linux ) but it got more and more depressed . 
^ it started binge-drinking during the day whilst i was away - i should have known something was wrong because i could smell the alcohol on its fan output . 
^ eventually the vodka frazzled its brain .
