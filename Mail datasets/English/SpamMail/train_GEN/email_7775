^ hi we have decided to not put a picture of you in the &name . 
^ i have bought you some presents and i thought we could get you a piece of jewellery like a ring or chain or something . 
^ i thought it would be nice to keep since its your 18th . 
^ i thought it would be better if you picked it though because i just did . 
^ also if it was a ring , you would need to get it fitted . 
^ i havent seen &name in &num weeks so i 'm suffering from withdrawal symptoms . 
^ see you soon , lots of love , &name xx &name &name &email
