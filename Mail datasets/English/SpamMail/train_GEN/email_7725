^ dear all , 
^ first of all thanks loads for agreeing to help us ( i.e. cusar - &name university student 's against racism ) with &name 's first ever respec ! 
^ festival- aiming to promote cultural diversity and anti-racism . 
^ the details of the events have now been finalised ( more publicity to follow) ... 
^ * sunday 23rd feb &email feat . 
^ &name plus loads of world music 
^ * monday 24th &name &name night at &name feat . 
^ &num professional comedians 
^ * saturday 1st march film night showing american history &char at king 's . 
^ i understand that you have kindly volunteered to help with tickets for the coco night and general publicity for the other events . 
^ in the next few days a person from cusar will get in touch with you indivudually to meet up and give you fliers , posters and tickets . 
^ they will start by giving you &num tickets at &pound; &num each , and will top you up as and when you need more . 
^ basically we ca n't afford to loose any tickets as we are running on a tight budget and even the loss of &num could seriously damage the night . 
^ we are not aiming to make a profit and any money we do make will be ploughed back into anti-racism projects . 
^ if we sell &num tickets we will cover our costs , but coco has a capacity of &num and it would be a great message to send out if the &name anti-racism campaign could ram coco and sell out . 
^ we have got a couple of big acts and it would be wicked if loads of people in &name could enjoy a night of diverse music / culture . 
^ also , if it is a success it makes it more likely that the event will go ahead next year . 
^ &num idea for selling tickets is to send an email out to your college lists publicising the event and then say that you will be in the bar / &name / jcr ( wherever there is a mass of people ) at say lunchtime and nab people as they go past . 
^ i have also pasted in a generic email for the coco night below which you can send to your lists . 
^ amend as you see appropriate . 
^ this is just an idea and do whatever you think will work best at your college . 
^ thanks loads again for all your help and i will be in touch soon to let you know how each college is doing 
^ please get contact me if you need more info / tickets 
^ cheers
