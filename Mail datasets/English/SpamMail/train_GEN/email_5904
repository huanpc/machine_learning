^ hi all , 
^ thanks for &name and &name 's suggestions and ideas ... it 's great to feel so much enthusiasm from everyone . 
^ so are we all agreeing to meet this afternoon at &name ? ? 
^ might be useful if everyone give some feedback to &name and &name and a confirmed time . 
^ i have been a bit dormant for the past &num days , was distracted by summer internship interviews , but i 'll catch up this weekend ! ! 
^ i am also learning latex ! 
^ but i gather there are a few experts in our group already . 
^ since the coming tuesday deadline is looming , it 'll be more efficient for the time being for &name to do the latex version of our documents , but i would love to learn from &name and &name , so later on when you guys are occupied with serious coding , i could cover for you . 
^ i 'd also like to help &name with project planning etc. . . 
^ ok , this is going to be a hectic weekend , but let 's do it !
