^ see the previous email . 
^ also , why would this query be issued if there is no other attribute distinguishing soldiers besides stream id ?

^ i thought that stream ids matter least for &name - there are as ma ny states as there are unique values for the group-by attributes - witho ut regard to stream id . 
^ the output of &name will include the group-by 
^ attribute values so the stream id is n't used to distinguish the resul ts . 
^ ) and what about input streams to &name ? 
^ how do ) they get distinguished ? 
^ in our current proposal , stream ids can get changed depending on what boxes they go through . 
^ so stream id does n't always give information a bout the original source of the data . 
^ so at what point do we need to distinguish input streams ? 
^ if the user needs to know where the data originally came from , they would add their own attribute using a map box because the user would never know that the system was using a stream id .
