^ so it 's becoming clear to me that i need to schedule a social event this summer , or else we 'll end up not having one . 
^ so my proposal is for all of us to attend the improv asylum in the &name &name some night to see some funny improvisation ( i 've heard great things about this group ) . 
^ tickets will be on me , though i will ask &num / &num of you to bring &num for &num coupons to keep my expenses down . 
^ ( i did hire a lot of people this summer . 
^ &smiley and pizza beforehand at &name &name sounds like it 's called for also . 
^ coupons for the main performing group are good for shows on &name nights ( at &num ) , so i propose we go either august &num or august &num ( provided that tix are available ) . 
^ so please let me know , &name :

^ if you 'd like to go , and &num . 
^ which night you 'd prefer
