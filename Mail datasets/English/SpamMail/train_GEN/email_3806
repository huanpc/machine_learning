^ my client requires &name data capture operators to digitally capture spatial and textual paper datasets to enable the implementation of the &name systems . 
^ data capture operators will be required to identify and resolve anomalies between computerised and hardcopy records ; prepare datasets for delivery to the external data capture organisation , by researching gaps in planning dataset and identifying and copying source documents ; liase with officers across relevant service areas where appropriate . 
^ we need people with an understanding of maps and addresses ( in particular large scale &name digital data ) , &name spatial data entry using either &name , &name or &name packages . 
^ experience of spatial and textual data capture projects desirable , but not essential . 
^ please send your &name to &email
