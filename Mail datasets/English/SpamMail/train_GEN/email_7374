^ dear &name , 
^ dad was pleased to see you on tuesday , and to hear that things seem to be going so well . 
^ we hope you enjoyed your field trip ( &name sounds more exciting , if more expensive ! ) . 
^ i told people about your sunday , and of course as happens in &name circles people knew lots of things about the churches involved - good and bad . 
^ &name said that &name &name , who used to come to st &name 's, is at &name &name . 
^ hearing &name &name sounds a wonderful experience too - if he is as good as his books . 
^ &name said the dean of &name used to be &name &name ( sea of faith movement - sort of christianity without the god bit ) so i reckon the present one must be an improvement , whoever . 
^ we had heard from &name that he knew him . 
^ i have sent on this week 's new scientist . 
^ i opened one of your letters by mistake and found it was a newletter from &name ( county council employees trade union ) so i do n't expect you want it . 
^ i have also not forwarded a request for you to give blood at the end of october . 
^ do you want 'management consultancy " magazine sending on ? 
^ have you found a doctor yet ? 
^ dad and i are not going away as we had intended but are having a couple of days out . 
^ on the tuesday of half term ( 23rd ) we are all going to see &name and grandpa for the day . 
^ love , mum
