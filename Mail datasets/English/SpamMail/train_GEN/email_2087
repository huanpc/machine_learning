) perhaps , perhaps not . ^ although , i have been informed that he either intends to talk all night , or sleep in the punt , or sleep in a field . ^ i think i 'd rather just talk all night . ^ it sounds more reassuring - we do n't know the personality of the sheep , cows and chickens down in  ame . ^ they may be vicious . ^ they probably are . ^ anyway , are you travelling down on the sunday ? ^ if not , please inform me before embarking on your trip to  ame . ^ now , when do you return from you holiday ? ^  ame . ^ so , i do n't suppose you are actually looking forward to going on holiday by any chance ? ^ i do n't seem to have detected any joyous proclamations in your e-mails lately . ^ ( like , my holiday to  ame is approaching - yippee ! ^ ) well , i hope you have a lovely holiday . ^ say hello to  ame for me . ^ you are a  ame . ^ section  um :  ame ^ if you forward my tales of  ame e-mail to your sibling  ame ( curious name ) then please insert a disclaimer exonerating me of all responsibility and insanity , which is bound to prevail upon the reader of the document concerning the mental state of its author . ^ now , i ca n't believe you missed an opportunity to see the emissary ! ! ! ^ now it will languish in the recess of your memory all throughout your holiday and propagate an expanded and augmented desire which will ultimately consume your entire being before it destroys you completely . ^ ( just joking ) with regards to shutting the it room , could n't you go to a different level , or were they all shut to ? ^ failing that , why did n't you use the secret computer console which  ame had installed for us devotees in the depths of the library ? ^ you know the code for its activation  ame is cool . ^ section  um : atomic clocks ^ i 'm kind of stuck here . ^ can you help me out ? ^ what on earth can i say about atomic clocks ? ^ well , since i can write essays about little green lights i can feel a nonsense essay coming along ! ! ! ^ well , there once was an old-fashioned wall clock in a decrepit watchmaker 's shop in  ame . ^ this clock was over  um hundred years old . ^ it 's casing was hand made from what had once been the finest wood for making hand made casings for old clocks in  ame . ^ it faithfully chimed every hour , peeling out its message of constancy and unilateral affirmation in the belief that time exists . ^ it had no other option but to believe that time existed . ^ you see , it was a clock . ^ its purpose was to measure a constant . ^ if it had no faith in the reason for its existence then it could very easily become self- centred , leading to insecurity concerning its usefulness in 17th century clock society . ^ it could become a social outcast , banished from the realm of time for half of eternity a concept it could n't quite grasp . ^ so the old clock faithfully proclaimed its message of the substantiality of time throughout the years . ^  um day , the clock was sold . ^ its new owner was a quantum physicist . ^ the old clock trembled at the title of its master 's profession . ^ when brought to the scientist 's house the clock was placed on a desk next to another timepiece an atomic  ame ! ^ well ! ^ over the weeks the clocks communicated with each other concerning a variety of subject . ^ they employed a subtle means in order to get their messages across . ^ each clock either speeded up or slowed down by a 100th of a second , for a 10th of a second at the turn of each minute . ^  har slowing down represented a  um , and a speeding up was taken to show a  um . ^ thereby the clocks spoke to each other in a language constructed from binary arithmetic . ^ much like modern day computers . ^ this was a lengthy process , but then , clocks have all the time in the world . ^ for the first few months they conversed merely about their past timekeeping posts , their personal details etc. then  um week the atomic clock began lecturing about relativity . ^ the old clock was slightly taken aback . ^ he had never heard this type of information before . ^ what did it mean ? ^ his whole belief system and self worth began to shake and totter . ^ if what the atomic clock said was true , then time was relative ! ^ he could no longer regard himself as a stalwartly consistent system . ^ he was no longer absolute . ^ the atomic clock had effectively removed from his mind all certainty and assurance . ^ the old clock 's timekeeping began to waver and after a few days he could no longer be relied upon to chime regularly . ^ he grew lazy and disorganised . ^ the atomic clock grew horrified at his new friend 's lack of commitment to the job . ^ he interrogated him as to the reason for his disturbing behaviour . ^  ame , my dear friend . ^ it 's the answer i 've been looking for since i was made ! ^ now we clocks no longer need to weary ourselves in constraint to this slavery of accuracy ! ^ relativity frees us to decide for ourselves what time it should be ! ! ! ^ the atomic clock 's dials whirled and spun as he tried to register this phenomenal news . ^ he asked the old clock why he had n't realised this himself . ^  ame , young fellow . ^ it takes an experienced clock to develop a theory which will change the world . ^ let the  ame revolution begin ! ! ! ^ liberty ,  ame ,  ame ! ^ the old clock began to rock back and forth in excitement . ^ he started to work himself into a frenzy , causing the atomic clock some alarm . ^ in an instant he toppled over , crashing to the floor ! ^ his dials and cogs lay splintered and broken . ^ the clock revolution was over , before it had scarcely begun . ^ the next day the physicist found the old clock shattered on the ground . ^ he picked it up with sorrow , the devastation his loss caused him evidently clear in his pain-filled eyes . ^ the atomic clock , slightly confused , assumed normal duties , as had been ingrained in it via the satellite transmitter which relayed its accurate time from space . ^ however , this satellite had also relayed the curious birth of the clock revolution to it 's base clock in  ame . </text_normal></message_body></message>
