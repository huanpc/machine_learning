^ the trip here was n't too bad . 
^ chandana and his wife were on the same flight to &name , so &char hung out with them in &name and took the free city tour to kill time . 
^ then they left for &name and me for &name . 
^ they had a more hellish trip than i did . 
^ another couple of hours in &name and then la and &name .
