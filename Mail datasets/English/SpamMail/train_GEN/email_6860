^ dear &name tape secs , 
^ i hope you 're all having a good term ! 
^ i do n't know whether i 've got the right people , but i 'm assuming you 'll know who 's agreed to record &name &name 's talk at the &name concert event on saturday ? 
^ if it 's not one of you , please could you pass this on to whoever 's doing it ? 
^ thanks ! 
^ just wanted to check how long it 'll take you to set up and go over this with &name ? 
^ i 'm assuming this could be done very quickly between 
^ &num 15ish and &num perhaps ? 
^ we wo n't be able to get into the chapel before then , because of evensong . 
^ the reason i 'm asking now is just so we can let &name know where he should be and when on the day , so if you could get back to me soon , that would be great &smiley thanks , &name
