^ this is strictly optional , but if you want to parse your own example questions to look at the &name , here 's what you have to do : 
^ &num start &name 
^ &num m-x allegro ( this assumes you still have the &name from last term ) 
^ &num at the &name ( &num ) prompt ( require : climxm ) &name ( &num ) : ( load " /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / newlkb / src / general / loadup " ) &name ( &num ) : ( load-system " mrs " ) 
^ this loads a modified &name 
^ &num &name &name &name 
^ &name complete grammar /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / erg / lkb / local-script 
^ it is important to load local-script rather than script . 
^ you will need about &num &name spare space in your ~/tmp directory for the lexicon etc ( you can always link it to local scratch if necessary ) 
^ you can then parse sentences as you did with your own grammar last term , but you will see an &name option on the menu that you get by clicking on the small parse tree . 
^ this displays the &name in a compact notation . 
^ to get the &name , use &name to expand menu , then &name / output level and choose &name . 
^ then everything you parse will get an &name &name in the * common-lisp * buffer of your emacs . 
^ if you want to save your own preferences , you will have to copy /usr / groups / nltools / lingo / erg / to your filespace . 
^ then load the grammar via script rather than local-script 
^ &name 
^ &name - i have no way of checking that i 've got all the file permissions etc right , so if you try this and it does n't work , let me know . 
^ i am sorry for the cumbersome &name loading procedure , but other methods require sys-admin to set things up .
