^ do you need these boots for tuesday ? 
^ &name & &name have offered to bring them up and have a day out in &name on saturday ( they would leave them with the porter if you are tied up ) but i do n't think they were planning a trip so if you do n't need them there 's no point . 
^ let us or them know !
