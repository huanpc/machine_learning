^ wonderful &name . 
^ there might be some sort of " export " command in your email prog . 
^ or the emails might well already be in a text file on your computer somewhere . 
^ do you use &name &name ? 
^ as regards what type of email , i 'll take anything you 've got ! 
^ in terms of usage , they 're just for my use at the moment , but if anything further is to happen with them i 'll chat with you about it before . 
^ also , some kind of anonymity processing will almost certainly be done on them before they are actually used . 
^ thanks &name !

^ &name , 
^ of course ! 
^ ( assuming i get an acknowledgement if you publish . ) now , what sort of emails would you like , and in what format ? 
^ i have personal &num , &num from cu , college , etc. .. shall i just copy them to a text file and email you them ? 
^ might take a day or so if i have to check them for sensitive content , but i doubt it . 
^ also , are they just for your use , or will other people see them ? 
^ ( i.e. do you think i need people 's permission to use their emails ? 
^ no , i doubt it . ) 
^ have a good day !

^ &name , 
^ for my masters project i 'm going to be building an email classification system , with the ultimate goal of distinguishing junk emails from non-junk emails . 
^ thing is , that i need to get hold of a data set of non-junk emails to train and test the system on . 
^ now , i remembered that you keep all your past emails , and so i was wondering if you would consider donating a copy of them ( or of a non-sensitive subset of them ! ) to me for my work . 
^ let me know what you think . 
^ &name 
^ ps . 
^ thanks for the card - what a great picture , and what a good day that was as well !
