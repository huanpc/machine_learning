^ hey all ... 
^ certainly we need to come to a decision ... people are certainly looking at our project now . 
^ i agree with &name 's idea of making the &name &name &name &num . 
^ however , more importantly , we need to do the following : 
^ &num &name &name . 
^ &name kindly volunteered to look into currect packaging and updating it . 
^ &num quadratic sieve . 
^ i think we need to run more tests to insure that &name runs to completion - if necessary debug it . 
^ &num take up dr &name 's challenge - he is really keen that we do something about it . 
^ i know that &name has been working on it .. but has come up with rather diminishing returns . 
^ maybe we ought to discuss this as a group ... maybe there is something wrong with &name . 
^ &name , please could you tell us what the status is / was with the test you are running / ran . 
^ also .. everyone .. have a great vacation . 
^ i 'll be in &name most of the time .. so if anyone needs to get anything done .. just shout for me . 
^ cheers , 
^ &name

^ the &name could be a good idea , if everyone wanted to do this . 
^ perhaps we should stamp a " &name &num &name &name " at the top of each of our source files though ! 
^ other part &num group projects have done this , particularly those who have gone on to place their projects on sourceforge and other development servers . 
^ i think after so much hard work that we all put in , we should put some indication of our copyright on the files before distributing them , especially if we make them open source as such . 
^ what does everyone else think about this ? 
^ there 's always &name . ... 
^ but our source and binaries are world-wide accessible already , and so i guess with the current setup , it would seem to give implicit permission for anyone to use it

^ hello everyone 
^ i think we should discuss our response to this , since everyone would have to agree about things like copyright etc. &smiley 
^ i.e. i think we should retain our copyright , as a group , to the source code .

^ hi , 
^ i downloaded your project , everything worked up until i tried to run the factorization server- the dist . 
^ server works well . 
^ i think there are programs missing from the distributable . 
^ i am the founder on &website we were interested in using your &name program for the rsa-576 factorization . 
^ we have access to well over &num , &num computer systems all over the world . 
^ anyhow , looking forward to your response , &name &name &website
