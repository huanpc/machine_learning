^ dear &name , &name and &name , ( i hope &name does n't mind all these emails ) 
^ well , interesting emails . 
^ even though the &name does n't have all the answers , it has all the answers we need and &name has all the answers - does anyone disagree ? 
^ okay , i do n't really like arguing about evolution etc. from a non-biblical point of view as we can never be certain of anything that way , but just this once ... ! 
^ &num ) i would tend to say he is attacking " &name , rather than defending traditional geology etc. look at the language he uses : " the scientific consensus is that the earth is of a vast age compared with " &name insists that the cosmos is only &num thousand years old . 
^ this is not the language of an objective critique of &name , as i surely do not need to point out . 
^ &num ) the fact that these fundamental concepts of geology were established before &name is of no relevance whatsoever . 
^ &num ) traditional geology and evolution is a model used to explain the way the world exists at this point in time . 
^ in my opinion it does this rather badly . 
^ now , you attack &name and ask for an alternative model . 
^ as &name mentioned , it would be advisable to read some &name literature . 
^ however , regardless of whether or not an alternative model is presented does not alter whether or not the first model is correct . 
^ &name taught egocentricity whether or not that was correct had nothing to do with whether or not &name had yet advanced the idea of heliocentricity . 
^ &num ) " christians do need to challenge the belief that the ultimate controlling power in the universe is blind chance . 
^ there are many ways of doing this including raising the argument for design , pointing out the existence of " irreducible complexity and so on . 
^ why could n't &name have used blind chance ? 
^ as i see it , we have already distanced him and diminished his role by attributing a large part our existence to slow-moving geological and evolutionary processes . 
^ why stop there ? 
^ blind chance is fundamental to the theory of evolution and accepting the major tenets of evolution without accepting the " god , so to speak , seems rather curious . 
^ &num ) " within geology , these &num concepts are universally held ; i have never heard any professional geologist deny any of them . 
^ &name some &name literature . 
^ also , &name pointed out that the fossil record would expect transitional fossils between ape and men . 
^ this is as much a challenge to evolutionists as the one lain down by the geologist who wrote the article we are discussing . 
^ hope you 're all well and having a good weekend . 
^ love &name
