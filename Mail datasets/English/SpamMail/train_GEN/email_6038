^ unfortunately not . 
^ i 'm not sure if it 's going to be possible to re-arrange , i 'm reluctant to break up certain blocks of time i have in order to maximise revision and in the other areas there does n't seem to be a suitable hole otherwise . 
^ i 'll have a think about it , but we may have to leave it this week . 
^ &name all is well with you ,
