^ i thought that stream ids matter least for &name - there are as many states as there are unique values for the group-by attributes - without regard to stream id . 
^ the output of &name will include the group-by attribute values so the stream id is n't used to distinguish the results .

^ and what about input streams to &name ? 
^ how do they get distinguished ?

<text_normal> 

^ in our current proposal , stream ids can get changed depending on what boxes they go through . 
^ so stream id does n't always give information about the original source of the data . 
^ so at what point do we need to distinguish input streams ? 
^ if the user needs to know where the data originally came from , they would add their own attribute using a map box because the user would never know that the system was using a stream id .

^ hi professor &name , 
^ &name and i have been emailing back and forth today discussing 
^ whether stream id is really necessary it seems that if restream is &name ved inside the aggregate boxes , and case statements done using map withou &char the restream afterwards , why keep stream id ? 
^ we will still have the probl em of concatenating attributes / keeping history inside the aggreagate boxes , 
^ but at least the problem becomes local to the aggregate boxes and is not system wide .
