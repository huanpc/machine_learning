^ cool 
^ sounds like a busy summer , and even more busy start to work . 
^ i do n't really know that much about your course , &name &name does n't talk too much about it . 
^ we tend to stick to the topics of army , women and beer etc. so shallow we are eh ? 
^ &name is half an hour away by car , which i do have , and &name is here as well . 
^ we are here for &num weeks , before coming back to &name till . . ... march i think .. then off to &name for &num weeks to do psychiatry . 
^ do not fear , i am not chopping up people yet , as i am still being taught sterile techniques , but we did observe loads of stuff yesterday , and i am back in theatre &num thursday , when i have been reliably informed by my very &name consultant that we will be taking a more " active " role , including suturing . 
^ average day is a bit poo actually . 
^ i left the house at &num this morning , and do n't expect to be back until &num or &num ( that 's today , tomorrow i may not be back till &name . 
^ &name is fine- do n't know if he needs to have injections yet , is still early stages , but most likely he will have to . 
^ he rang me last night to pick my brain on diabetes , which is fine . 
^ he 'll survive . 
^ well , got to run , and do some work before due in theatre briefly at &num . 
^ &name work is well , 
^ t'ra , and say hi to your annonymous housemates ,

^ &name &name , 
^ &name road , eh ? 
^ &name &name &name &name &name and &name ... what more do you need ? 
^ &smiley i like the grapes , but noone else ever did so we never went . 
^ is n't bury quite a bit away ? 
^ how long does that take you ? 
^ do you have a car ? 
^ is anyone else at the same place ? 
^ and were you actively taking part in operations today ? ! 
^ or just observing ? 
^ scary thought , you being let loose on people 's insides ... and how long are your days ? 
^ did you know a girl called &name &name in the &name ? 
^ &name was talking about the exchange thing to &name today ( not to me in particular) . 
^ apparently you need an american accent to be able to use their directory enquiries ... ? 
^ that 's the kind of stuff our course is about , although i suppose if you 're friends with &name you 'll already know all about it . 
^ that 's bad news about your little brother . 
^ how 's he coping with having to give himself injections ? 
^ ( he does n't have a fear of needles or anything , does he ? ) still , there are far worse things to be diagnosed with , so as long as everything and everyone else is fine ... 
^ the scholarship 's just a fancy name for a departmental grant . 
^ i 'm assuming &name got one too , or if he can afford to self-fund i might have to start chatting him up , ha ha . 
^ the work is ... well .. now 's probably a bad time to ask , &name i 've spent all day in the lab ( until about 9pm ) doing c++ practicals . 
^ why do i do this to myself ? 
^ i hate programming ! 
^ and that was after lectures from 10am-1pm . 
^ no lunch either . 
^ hmph. and the bastarding thing * still * does n't work yet ! 
^ but anyway , i 'm sure you do n't want to hear me bitching about infinite while loops and the subtle differences between &name and c++ ... &smiley 
^ but , generally , the work seems okay . 
^ ca n't really tell yet , &name this was our first day of what will be our normal timetable : last week was introductory week and the timetable was rammed and very tiring . 
^ we have a free day on wednesdays which is nice . 
^ sort of like having &num really short weeks with weekends . 
^ i was at home on and off for the summer . 
^ i seemed to spend most of it on trains , travelling to visit people or coming back again . 
^ went to &name a couple of times . 
^ i thoroughly recommend &name , where you can get pleasantly pissed and pretend you 're only doing it in the name of education . 
^ my house is full of masters students , i think . 
^ noone i knew before and noone doing my course , but i 'd met them all by &name &name and they 're all really nice . 
^ i have n't seen many of them since , though , &name i 've been so busy . 
^ &name . 
^ and i ca n't remember * any * of their names . 
^ i 'm bad enough with british names , but they 're all from overseas and they all seem to begin with an &name .. that 's not true actually : there 's &name and &name , but that 's only her english name and we agreed i 'd call her by her chinese name &name it 's much nicer . 
^ if only i could remember what it is ... 
^ anyway , my neck aches from straining at a computer all day so i 'd better leave it there . 
^ &name , i do n't remember typing that much , but this email is really long . 
^ sorry to bore you ... &smiley 
^ see you , 
^ &name 
^ &name my &name number is &num . 
^ well , am living in private house down &name &name , next door to the grapes ( &name ) , but with all college peeps . 
^ surgery is excellent , have spent all day in theatre today , taking out gall bladders and such . 
^ am at bury for it though , so not about much in the week , and am away with &name most weekends . 
^ very time consuming year . 
^ never mind eh ? 
^ army is cool , did a swap with some americans this year , so went to train in &name for a month , then travelled for a bit , and did some trekking in the mountains . 
^ did n't get much time at home over the summer mind , so a bit of a bummer . 
^ bro has come to visit me here already tho , and sis is due to at some point . 
^ all are doing fine , but my little bro has just been diagnosed diabetic . 
^ you sound like you have done ok for yourself , scholarship and all . 
^ woo woo ! ! 
^ glad work sounds busy but fun ( ?) . 
^ tell em more about your summer and work and stuff . 
^ who you living with this yr ? 
^ &name &name 's ? 
^ i think that is what &name got stuck with &name 
^ &name &name answer is i ca n't remember on the &name thing- do n't remember adding you to ignore tho . 
^ send me your no. again- ca n't find it on search

^ sorry for the late reply , but i 've had a busy weekend . 
^ so you 're in a house somewhere ? 
^ a college one ? 
^ whereabouts ? 
^ i know some of the &name ( clinical ) medics have absolutely gorgeous houses on &name road ... very jealous . 
^ so what does starting surgery involve ? 
^ what have you been doing up until now ? 
^ i think i know who &name must be , but do n't know him , if you know what i mean . 
^ not very tall with short blondish hair ? 
^ so he 's in the &name with you ? 
^ i take it you 're still enjoying running around with guns in the cold and wet at weekends ... ? 
^ &smiley 
^ did you do anything army related this summer , or what were you up to ? 
^ i did n't think i 'd be coming back to &name after graduation &name i had n't got funding to do the &name , although i 'd got a place on ther course . 
^ so i had a very , very lazy summer and did n't get a job at all . 
^ lazy bitch . 
^ i 've had my siblings nagging me for being unemployed right from the start , ha ha . 
^ but i ended up getting a scholarship so i can afford to do this year after all . 
^ how was your graduation , by the by ? 
^ did your family come down for it ? 
^ how is everything at home ? 
^ and how are you ? 
^ i 'm not too bad . 
^ lacking a bit in the sleep department , but i 'm sure i 'll catch up sometime . 
^ anyway , i 'd better get a wriggle on since i have a practical lab this afternoon after lectures and bugs to fix in my code . 
^ &name . 
^ see you soon , 
^ &name 
^ &name you cunningly avoided the &name thing ... did i piss you off ? 
^ ( it would n't be the first time ... &smiley ) 
^ &name was quite drunk yes ( hall indeed ) , and did n't spot you . 
^ apologies . 
^ most people are still about- am living with &name , barn &name and &name , so we are all still here &name schl is really good fun actually . 
^ lots of work , and quite time consuming , but one of those things i guess . 
^ am starting surgery on monday . ... good laugh hopefully see you are doing an &name in computers . 
^ you may see &name ( army / &name ) , he is doing it as well . 
^ keep going on &char 's if you like - speaking of which , how are you and such ? 
^ at &num : &num &num / &num / &num &num , you wrote : &name , 
^ yes , i was at the pav . 
^ and , yes , you looked straight at / through me a good few times . 
^ i suppose i just found it hard to believe that you could not know me . 
^ and especially since i know you added me to your ignore list on &name at some point last year , i assumed you just were n't speaking to me . 
^ were you drunk ? 
^ i take it you were at &name then ... &smiley i saw a few of your friends at the pav as well ... are most of them still here or have most graduated and gone ? 
^ and how 's clinical school treating you ? 
^ &name .. too many questions to ask ... &smiley 
^ see you sometime , 
^ &name 
^ &name , no to both ? 
^ did i see you last night at the pav or something- or rather not spot that i saw you . 
^ if you know what i mean ? 
^ how 's things anyway ? 
^ on an &name i see . 
^ cool 
^ at &num : &num &num / &num / &num &num , you wrote : just so ( if there 's &char ) next time i know , do you think i 'm ignoring you or are you ignoring me ?
