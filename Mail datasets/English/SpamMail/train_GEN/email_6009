^ you mentioned that " there is at least &num virus which has been packaged with &name &name " . 
^ what is the virus and what is known about it ? 
^ i know that 's a wide open question , but the more we know about it the better . 
^ we 're concerned that we may have infected some fairly influential clients and we want to be able to diffuse the situation as quickly as possible .

^ may &num , &num &name , i have been using your &name software for well over a year for distributing files to users in my firm . 
^ today , my boss was updating his &name software and it informed him that he had several viruses on his computer contained in .exe files which had all been created by &name . 
^ if you know what might be causing this issue we would greatly appreciate any clarification or insight you might be able to provide . 
^ i apologize for not using your &name key , but i do n't run any of the software that it interfaces with .

^ do you know what anti-virus software he has ? 
^ i suspect that it is a false-positive . 
^ very ocassionally i 've had problems with &name 's &name &name thinking that these files are viruses , generally when the " bloodhound " heuristic testing is enabled . 
^ in these cases a new update is generally released fairly quickly , provided someone tells them of the problem . 
^ the second possibility is that the files he has are not the &num you created , but files sent by e-mail or something which may indeed be a virus because there is at least &num virus which has been packaged with &name &name &smiley
