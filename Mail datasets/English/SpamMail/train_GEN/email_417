^ hi &name , 
^ yes , as you know , i did play a " trick " on you . 
^ i regret doing so , but not because you will play a mean trick on me . 
^ personally , i blame &name - and he will suffer the consequences this weekend . 
^ 'suffer " being the ( very ) appropriate word . 
^ by the way - interesting information - &name has left his new mobile at home ... ( ! ) see you at &num : &num or &num : &num - whenever . 
^ i hope you have a good day - i have had . 
^ my professor told me my results from yesterday were n't wrong - just not what i had expected . 
^ i am now finished for the day ! 
^ &name 
^ ( seriously though - sorry for playing a trick on you . 
^ i admit that it was a bit devious of me . 
^ i look forward to your revenge - but please leave it at that . )
