^ earlier in the week i announced a power outage for &num next tuesday , 29th october ( with possible overrun to &num ) . 
^ after much discussion , it has now been decided that the work can be carried out safely with the majority of the power distribution board " live " . 
^ only the circuits immediately adjacent to those being worked on will need to be switched off . 
^ the circuits to be switched off supply the telephone equipment ( which has battery backup ) and some of the air handling units . 
^ thus there is likely to be some degradation in ventilation and environmental control , but all power and lighting circuits are now expected to remain on . 
^ there is a remote possibility that when the work starts it will be found necessary to switch off after all , so the time period advertised should still be regarded as vulnerable to possible disruption of supply .
