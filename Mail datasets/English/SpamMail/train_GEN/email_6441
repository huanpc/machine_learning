^ we would be glad if you could remember our clients in your prayers , especially praying for understanding and tolerance amongst our local population for people who are far from home and who have lost everything , their families , friends and possessions . 
^ especially recently during the war many of our clients from &name had great worries and anxieties about the people they had left behind . 
^ you may also wish to remember those who are here because of their christian faith . 
^ there are a number of asylum seekers who suffered persecution because they belonged to christian communities in countries such as &name . 
^ should members of your congregation wish to make any donations or to do anything tangible for our clients , we would of course be very grateful . 
^ naturally , donations of money are especially welcome , because we have to buy items such as underwear for people who arrive here with absolutely nothing , books & dictionaries for english teaching , telephone cards for essential phone calls and some books and toys for children . 
^ but we also need exercise books , pens , letter paper and envelopes , colouring pencils and basic items for children starting school . 
^ thank you for your interest and concern . 
^ &name 's &name ( &name ) : 
^ on thursday i visited the seafarer 's &name at &name ( rather a lot bigger than the &name caravan ! ) services are led in the chapel there on sunday evenings , usually by churches in &name .

^ you could do this any way you like . 
^ if you are interested contact &name &name &name - &email or phone him on &num &num .
