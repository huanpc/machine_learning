^ ok , i did n't look at the date of the debate and i did realise that you forwarded it because of the western guy . 
^ i 'm knot stoopid ya no. 
^ i went to see personnel yesterday and the quine said my holiday would be ok because i 'll still be working for about &num weeks or something . 
^ i did n't actually mention &char in the park to her but i do n't see why that should be a problem if i 'm willing to switch shifts or do extras to make up for it . 
^ but anyway , i have to go back to ask my supervisor so it 's up to them . 
^ i do n't know the name of my chargehand but she has a big mole thing above &num eyebrow and &name thinks this is &name somebody or other by my detailed description . 
^ i was doing some m&s ribbons on my first day but now i think we 're just doing any old rubbish . 
^ i 'm sure she said the stuff we were doing yesterday was for &name for their sandwiches but i may have misheard cuz i 've never heard of that before . 
^ oh , the noise in that place . 
^ and we had &name people in today but they did n't come near me so it was ok . 
^ i saw &name yesterday but she never saw me . 
^ she 's on the opposite shift but i do n't know if she 's alternating so i may be working with her next week . 
^ &name , guess where i went last night . 
^ the &name &name , to see . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... 
^ the proclaimers ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ &name , it was so magic . 
^ they sold out quite quickly but &name got put on a waiting list and &num tickets were cancelled so we got them . 
^ even though we did n't know most of the songs it was still really good but some stupid cow almost started a fight during &num miles trying to get to the front centre . 
^ but she got chucked out so the song was n't entirely ruined . 
^ oh , mam says that the music you were trying to find last time you were up is " the dance of the capulets " from the ballet of &name and &name . 
^ ok , that 's it , except when are you ( or are you ) coming home ? 
^ &name
