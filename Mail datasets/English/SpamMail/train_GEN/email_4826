^ hey &name , 
^ sorry for the delay in response - we lost power for a while due to the thunder storm . 
^ no , it should be spred or else the grammer will not be &name . 
^ you can still have more and , or , or not statements ( just put them in the right side ) . 
^ we do n't need exceptions because according to &name we do n't anticipate any errors . 
^ let 's talk when you get in tomorrow ( i should be in earlier than you ) to see where we are and should be done from here .

^ in the not , and , or , why is left called with &name ( ) and right &name ( ) . 
^ i think both should be &name ( ) because they may have tree may have more and , or , not statements . 
^ also what kind of exception do you want to use to signal a non-predicate token ? ?
