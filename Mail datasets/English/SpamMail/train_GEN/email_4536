^ hey &name , 
^ that sounds lovely , and &char ( truly - this is not sarcasm ) feel honoured to be asked . 
^ i would love to go ... however ... if you feel it 's too expensive , that 's fine . 
^ i am not &char verburdened on the wealth front , but i have some money stashed away under the mattress , and this on ce-in-a-lifetime ( -possibly ) chance seems like a good investment . 
^ it is also a valid excuse for a &char ew dress . 
^ basically , if you decide to go , it would be super to come with you . 
^ if you feel it 's too expensive / someone you asked previously suddenly says yes / they ask you to support &name on stage that night , i 'll survive the disappointment ... just ! 
^ it would be fab to spen &char a night on your arm , but it would be just as nice to spend an hour on your sofa having coffee ( but wi thout the make-up ) . 
^ &name choisi , mon ami , &name merci beaucoup beaucoup for asking , whichever &name &char decide . 
^ love , &name xx

^ hi &name , 
^ just had an idea - would you be interested in coming up to &name for a &name &name ? 
^ &name and a posse of her friends are going to &name &name , and &name was asking if i wanted to go , but i would rather have someone to go with - otherwise i will only know &name , and she will want to be with her posse , none of which i really know ( i do n't think ) . 
^ and quite frankly there are n't any girls in &name attractive enough for me to go with , so hence i 'm turning to you . 
^ &name is , it 's quite expensive ( ~&pound; &num ) &char &char i 'm trying to decide whether i can really afford it anyway , and i know you 're not exactly rolling in it ! 
^ anyway , let me know if you might be interested . 
^ &name 
^ it 's fast , it 's easy and it 's free !
