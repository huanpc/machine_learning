^ &name &name , did you actually get any emails from me , or did dad just pass on my address ? 
^ &name i did try and send you some but i think i maybe had an old address or something . 
^ anyway , the weather was really nice here at the start of term but it 's getting much colder now and i have a cold . 
^ which is not nice . 
^ never mind , i still ahve n't missed a single lecture yet , which i 'm quite proud of . 
^ i have a 9am start every day including saturday , which is a bit of a pain ... actually it 's a huge pain , but at least our terms are really short . 
^ will we be seeing you at christmas this year ? 
^ i finish on the 3rd of december , i think . 
^ lectures maybe finish on the 1st , actually , but i do n't know when dad 's planning on coming down to travel back with me . 
^ he might be looking for a new car down here and then driving back with it . 
^ apparently the cars are a lot cheaper down here , which i did n't know . 
^ i have n't seen &name since she came up for the day when mam was down to see me . 
^ she said i could always phone if i was at aloose end at the weekend or anything , but i never get a spare minute let alone day ! 
^ the workload is pretty tough on 1st years doing eg computer science , natural sciences etc. . 
^ as opposed to eg english students who write an essay a week and get to pick and choose the lecures ( if any ) they go to . 
^ and they get a lie in on saturdays . 
^ it 's not fair . 
^ i should 've done that instead . 
^ who was playing at the hockey game ? 
^ who won ? 
^ i 'm starting to get withdrawal symptoms from not being able to go to any &name games , but at least i get my &name every week so i can keep track of them . 
^ ( you can tell &name that , no , i have n't started going to the &name &name games . ) i 'm hoping i 'll get time to watch the &name game when it comes , but i completely missed &name just &name i had so much work ! 
^ saw us get beat by the all blacks at &name though . 
^ i 'd better try to do a bit more of my practical now . 
^ if you know anyone who can program in &name then let me know , &name i could use a hand ! 
^ see you whenever ,

^ hi &name : 
^ this was the first e-mail i got from you . 
^ i got your address from your dad . 
^ you will not be seeing us at christmas unless we win the lottery . 
^ i had originally planned coming home for the new year but we found out at the beginning of the year that &name was not allowed to take holidays the first week in january incase there are &name problems . 
^ now i am the &name coordinator for &name &name and may have to work on january 1st and 2nd . 
^ if &name had just told his place of employment that he already was booked his holiday , then i would n't have been stuck with this lovely assignment . 
^ when we went to the hockey game in &name , &name and &name were playing . 
^ &name won , &name is playing very well this year . 
^ &name was going to go to the pub { scots corner } this sunday to watch the &name celtic game but it is being televised at &num a.m our time and he feels he needs his beauty sleep . 
^ plus he will have been at a wedding the night before . 
^ he will go to the " corner " to watch the &name &name game next week . 
^ the weather has improved although we still have snow lying about . 
^ today has been nice and sunny and tomorrow is supposed to be nice . 
^ i do n't know anyone who can program in &name but will check around . 
^ though i 'm sure you 'll manage . 
^ anyway i 've got to go and get some work done . 
^ love 
^ &name
