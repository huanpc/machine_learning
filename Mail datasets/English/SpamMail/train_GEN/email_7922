^ &name for letting me know what to do at the bank . 
^ i 'll be better prepared when i go in next time ! 
^ my total bill came to &num , &num so that 's what i 'll be paying in. might have to spread it over a couple of payments , though . 
^ ok ? 
^ i 'll add the price of &name 's top as well . 
^ i really liked the colours of her &num as does she . 
^ &name has sold his old computer for &num squid . 
^ i 'm giving him a bit of the new one for his exams ( ! ) and he 's started paying me for the remainder . 
^ you 'll have to ask him about the spec but &name &name and &name are having orgasms over it . 
^ apparently it was good value for &num all in. ( ca n't find the pound sterling sign though ! ) 
^ recovering from the agony that was the fitba yesterday . 
^ at least the pain is over for a couple of years . 
^ wonder how &char & &char are taking it . 
^ do n't suppose you happened to see &name in &name on the national news at tea-time yesterday ? 
^ fame at last ! 
^ i wish i 'd been taping it ! 
^ do n't know if she 'll be home tonight or tomorrow .

^ will keep you posted . 
^ got my hearing tested at the &name clinic today . 
^ that 's my appointment finally come round since being referred in january . 
^ my hearing loss chart is the mirror image of my last &num &num years ago-now i 'm not hearing high tones . 
^ worst of all , i 've been told to give up tea / coffee unless it 's decaffeinated , chocolate & fags . 
^ apparently they all contribute to &name disease which is what i 've got . 
^ give me the razor & i 'll slash my wrists now ! 
^ the good news is that my good ear is unlikely to be affected and if the vertigo comes back with a vengeance , i 'll be prescribed a diuretic to get rid of the fluid in my inner ear ( which is what i should have been getting when i was off work) . 
^ wish i 'd seen the consultant earlier !
