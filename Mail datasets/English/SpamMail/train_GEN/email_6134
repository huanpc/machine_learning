^ &name &name &name is coming up on friday and staying &name and sat nights , so on saturday he 'll pop in to hear some of the 2-3.30pm rehearsal on saturday ( i wo n't be around , but he knows where he 's coming - perhaps one of you , armed with the photo of him in the program ( ! ) could look out for him , though i 'm sure he 'll make himself known ! ) . 
^ i will then meet him and bring him to &name 's for 6.30pm . 
^ if you could arrange somewhere to pray in &name 's from &num that would be great - and if &name can join us , and anyone else who wants to ( maybe &num or &num exec members may like to if they free ) feel free ... ) let me know where that will be sometime and then i can bring &name to the right place ! 
^ i 'll go and retrieve the prog from my pigeon hole and take a look now ... 
^ love &name

^ i 'll drop in sometime during the day . 
^ then i 'll see you in whoever 's room at &num . 
^ just tell me where . 
^ &name 
^ hi &name thanks for letting me know . 
^ &name &name and &name &name , the &num administrators ( who are doing very well even though rushed off their feet ! ) suggest the following : if you 'd like to hear some or all of the final rehearsal , you 'd be welcome to come along to &name &name 's chapel for that , which is 2-3.30pm in the afternoon . 
^ we are having our weekly central &name prayer meeting from 4-5pm and then our &name teaching , with &name &name , from 5-6.10pm . 
^ both of those are in &name chapel , very near to &name &name 's place . 
^ you 'd be more than welcome to come along to either or both of those if you wanted to . 
^ it would be good then to get to &name &name 's and pray beforehand . 
^ chapel evensong is taking place from 6.30-7.15pm . 
^ what is suggested is that we meet at &name &name 's with a couple of others who are involved and pray in someone 's room from &name , and then when eveningsong is over the stewarding team will move in and organise the chapel . 
^ the technical guys can make sure you 're correctly wired up and then we 'll all be set . 
^ i hope that this all makes some kind of sense ! 
^ i realise that if you come to all of this you will have no time for dinner - so do work out how you can best fit that in too ! 
^ yours , &name

^ &name , 
^ i 'll be there all day ( we 're staying with &name &name &name on the friday night , and we 'll be mooching around &name all day saturday . 
^ just tell us when and where to be , and we 'll be there .
