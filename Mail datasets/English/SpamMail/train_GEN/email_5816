^ the words will indeed be in the program , but i think the thinking is that it would be good to give everyone a chance to take away a copy of &name 's gospel so they can read the whole thing . ...

^ why do we need &num ? 
^ i thought that the words were going to be translated in the progrma . 
^ can we just then give a liberal scattering if people want to take them away ? 
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ i can do . 
^ &name : how do you react to this ? 
^ realistically i do n't think we can get more before saturday . 
^ we can either &num ) use the &num we have or &num ) make some of our own . 
^ what do you want to do ? 
</text_embedded>

^ i think there may be a possibility that &name &name may have some more in his room . 
^ perhaps , &name , you could let us know when you get this how many you have , if indeed you have any . 
^ also , &name , could you let me know if you have a little stash of blue witness cafe cards which we think were with the pencils which you have now returned . 
^ thanks , &name
