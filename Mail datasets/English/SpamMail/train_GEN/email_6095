^ dear chorus members , 
^ i 've had an enquiry about borrowing a carol book for &name 19th . 
^ does anyone have access to a set of &num carols for choirs , or carols for &name &name &num & &num , which they might be able to borrow for use on the day - and with luck next thursday evening as well ? 
^ i realise that it 's quite an expensive item at this time of the term . 
^ i also realise that schools and churches may well be using them , if not on that very day then after our concert , and they would not want to run the risk of losing any . 
^ however if anyone can find a source it would be hugely appreciated by those who have n't managed to secure one yet . 
^ please let me know asap if you have any news ! 
^ best wishes , &name
