^ dear &name &name , 
^ &name 's &name is ever closing in on us with only a week and a half to go ! 
^ * prayer for the concert needs to be a priority * 
^ firstly , we would strongly encourage you if you are not already , to make time daily to pray specifically for the concert . 
^ secondly , our last prayer meeting before the day is next tuesday ( note the change of date from before ) . 
^ it is at 7.30pm until &num ( ish ) and will consist of &num / &num hour of catching up with the latest news , reviewing the final draft of the programme , discussing the weather etc. and then we 'll pray from &num . 
^ it 'll be in &name 's room , which is &name ( &name &name ) &name college - if you do n't know where that is either e-mail me for directions or ask someone who does . 
^ last week we asked you to make life your priority instead of the prayer meeting . 
^ this week however , we would ask you to make this prayer meeting a high priority . 
^ if tuesday night is your essential &name honey appreciation meeting that you have been waiting to go to for months and just ca n't miss it because you 'll never get another chance to sample &num different types of honey , then could you please e-mail us to say that you 're not coming & we 'll send you a list of prayer points so you can still pray for the concert . 
^ if you can come then that 's great . 
^ could you please e-mail me so that i know rough numbers ? 
^ if you just do n't know because your auntie &name has said that she might come up on tuesday and wants to go out for a meal , but then again , she might come up on wednesday ... could you still e-mail us so i can send you prayer points so that you can pray if you do n't come and so that i know to count you as a " possible " . 
^ please e-mail some kind of response ! ! 
^ many thanks , 
^ &name &name and &name &name &name , &name 's &name , 11th feb &num
