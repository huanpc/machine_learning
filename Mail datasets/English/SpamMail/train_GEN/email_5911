^ &website airport &name . 
^ back when i was in university , i grew lost and confused when i realized that i hated my original area of study . 
^ i took a test to see what the special computer program thought i should be doing , and the first item on the list was 'stuntwoman . " well , okay , i 'm a bit of a fast driver , but i 'm nervous about heights , nervous about moving at good speed without a vehicle around me ( like skiing ) , and nervous about just about everything else . 
^ it was a bit hard to picture doing for what would have probably been a very short adult life - did i mention i 'm a klutz , too ? 
^ sometimes technical writing requires me to be a stuntwoman , though . 
^ i 'm constantly having to hack my way through techno-jargon jungles so i can explain things to my readers . 
^ &char alpha and &name &name software , which is definitely a habit that requires a crash helmet at times . 
^ i also have to navigate the treacherous &name rapids of grouchy readers , buggy software , and the occasional ill-tempered editor with a blood-red editing pencil of doom . 
^ not to fear , though . 
^ i 've slogged through another harrowing week to churn out another issue of penguin &org . 
^ just do n't expect me to jump out of any perfectly good airplanes any time soon ! 
^ see you at &name , &name &name 
^ gnomeeggs 
^ choosing a distribution , part &num - &name &name &name &num 
^ while &name fans love to debate which is the best distribution , typically the one cited with the largest 'market share " is &name &name &name . 
^ the latest trend with this product has been to remove as many tasks from the installation as possible : if it does n't need to be done during the installation , it can wait . 
^ after all , the more chances for the install to crash before you can finish it , the more annoying your life could be . 
^ the &name &name &name &num installation process is heavily automated , but that does n't mean you do n't have any choices . 
^ when you pop in the install &name and reboot the machine , you reach an initial screen where most folks are just going to press &name . 
^ however , here is where you can select the installation type that 's right for you . 
^ if you tried using the standard install and the &name causes problems with your system , you can boot with the &name again and type linux text at the installer 's boot prompt . 
^ having troubles when the installer probes your hardware that causes problems with your install ? 
^ type linux noprobe at the installer 's boot prompt . 
^ if you 're having trouble for what seems to be no apparent reason , then reboot and try linux mediacheck . 
^ this will have the installer inspect your cds to see if anything is wrong with them - and in fact , this comes up by default if you 're installing a downloaded version of &name . 
^ the function keys &name - &name contain more ways to customize which installer you use , and other useful information . 
^ once you 've started the installation itself , the process follows the &name &num documentation pretty well . 
^ rather than copying what 's said there right here , i 'll point you to the installation guide and talk instead about &name &num itself . 
^ you wo n't find a standard gnome or &name interface here . 
^ instead , you 'll find bluecurve , which is &name &name 's attempt to bring the best of both sets of tools and features together . 
^ you 'll also have access to &name 's series of administration tools . 
^ in the &name , you can find them in the main menu under system settings and system tools ( mostly system tools ) . 
^ if you prefer the command line , then you can find them by typing the following to get the full list of the tools you have installed : 
^ rpm -qa | grep redhat-config 
^ this command uses the &name &name &name manager ( rpm ) - the tool that keeps track of what software you have installed , what pieces depend on other pieces , and so on - to look at every rpm you have installed ( by name ) , and search for those whose names contain the text 'redhat-config . " in my case , the list is pretty long : 
^ it 's worth your while to really sit down and learn the rpm tool . 
^ many distributions actually use this package management scheme these days ; it 's not just a &name thing . 
^ you can also make use of redhat-config-packages ( main menu | system settings | add / remove applications ) to add and remove software if you 'd rather do it this way . 
^ &name &name &name is a solid distribution that 's been around for years . 
^ you 'll find a lot of software that 's written with &name in mind , so if you want to try lots of different programs it 's not a bad idea to try out this distribution . 
^ the installation is flexible enough that you can include lots of graphical packages for a flashy experience , or leave out most of them for a nice , reliable server that 's not using too much of its memory for drawing windows . 
^ next week : &name &name / &name

^ ~ /.bash_profile versus ~ /.bashrc , and more 
^ &name &name &name has a number of questions that other folks might also be thinking . 
^ his letter sounded like a great basis for a &name section . 
^ first , he writes : 
^ " in response to penguin &org issue ( &num ) , about the ~ /.profile tip : 
^ " &name ~ /.bashrc do too ? 
^ i 've always used it ( both on &name and &name ) . " &name 's response : 
^ ultimately , the answer to this question depends on how you tend to use your machine . 
^ when you log into your account , &name looks to ~ /.bash_profile or ~ /.profile ( along with the system-wide /etc / profile ) for the variables that need to be set and the commands that need to be run . 
^ the ~ /.bash_profile is n't consulted again until the next time you log in. 
^ ~ /.bashrc has a subtly different function . 
^ this file is consulted for commands to run and variables to set every time you spawn an interactive subshell . 
^ now , what the heck does that mean ? 
^ an interactive shell is one that lets you enter data by hand ( usually through a keyboard ) and shows you output ( usually on a screen ) . 
^ a subshell is , well , a shell inside a shell . 
^ normally when i talk about subshells i 'm talking about shell scripts , since whenever you run a script it spawns its own little shell to run within , but a shell script 's shell is n't considered interactive . 
^ i always feel like i 'm talking in circles when i try to explain this . 
^ the best way to figure this out is to edit your ~ /.bashrc file and add the following line at the end : 
^ &name " i just ran .bashrc " 
^ then , edit your ~ /.bash_profile or ~ /.profile file and add the following at the end ( with the appropriate file name ) : 
^ &name " i just ran .bash_profile " 
^ now you can experiment and see when each of these files is consulted . 
^ try using the su command to access this same user account , such as su &name . 
^ then try logging in directly in a virtual terminal . 
^ see what the differences are . 
^ you might be surprised to realize that , at times , both files are consulted ! 
^ that is , they might be , depending on how your particular distribution is set up . 
^ next , &name &name &name writes : " i type $ { path } instead of path because i saw it in an example suse-configfile . 
^ are the { } really necessary ? 
^ i did n't think do : only when the name of the variable has spaces or special characters , right ? " &name responds : 
^ i 'm not sure you can create a variable with a space in its name . 
^ give it a try : 
^ $ " &name one' &num &name : &name &name : command not found you need braces if you want to attach characters directly after a variable without any spaces . 
^ for example , in the following scenario : 
^ $ num1 $ echo $ &name &num $ echo $ &num $ echo $ &num &num positional parameters can also involve braces . 
^ when writing shell scripts , a positional parameter refers to what you typed on the command line . 
^ positional parameters are always preceded with a $ . 
^ for example , if you type the following to run a shell script : 
^ $ myscript &num &num &num &num 
^ $ &num is the positional parameter referring to the script 's name , 'myscript . " $ &num is the positional parameter referring to " &num , " $ &num to " &num , " $ &num to " &num , " and $ &num to " &num . " the problem is that the shell automatically expects a positional parameter to be in the format $ # . 
^ what if you have &num or more input entries after your shell script 's name ? 
^ you might try echo $ &num in your script and end up with the output : 
^ one0 
^ so , instead , if your positional parameter is &num or larger , you use the braces ; it would be $ { 10 } . 
^ finally , &name &name &name writes : " when i use a custom .bashrc ( or .profile ... whatever ) in /root i must add also $ { rootpath } , not only $ { path } . 
^ otherwise some root-only programs wo n't work . 
^ the strange thing is : neither with env | grep path or set | grep path , the rootpath variable turn up ? ! ? " &name responds : 
^ &name appears to be peculiar to both particular distributions . 
^ are you using env and set from within the root account ? 
^ submit a resource | discuss | recommend it ! 
^ &name &num 
^ &name &name , a &name &name , submitted this question : 
^ " i just recently discovered your site during my introduction to the world of weblogs , and soon after i discovered the &name conference page . 
^ it looks to be a pretty interesting setup , but unfortunately my travel budget is minimal this year ( i just got my walking papers from grad school - and the bill ) . 
^ i have gone to large events like &name &name in the past , and they have generally made papers / notes from the conference available to members . 
^ i was wondering if &name might be distributing conference documentation to non-attending individuals . 
^ i know that half the fun is on-site networking , but i was curious if there was other means of getting access to some of the knowledge without being on-site . " in the past , we 've worked with our speakers to have their materials published somewhere online at some point after their presentation . 
^ truthfully , the only way to experience &name fully is to be there in person . 
^ there 's an extreme value in what you 'll uncover at our scheduled events , but the " hallway conversations " will prove to be just as priceless . 
^ keep that in mind before passing on your pre-registration opportunity . 
^ this is an investment in your professional future . 
^ gnomepenguins 
^ bring it on , &name 
^ apparently there 's some interest out there in &name and latex . 
^ no , these are n't types of food or paint . 
^ &name is a typeface layout language popular in the math and scientific circles , and latex is a macro package that makes your work in &name a whole lot easier . 
^ the version of &name typically used in the &name world is a package called tetex , and this setup usually comes with your &name distribution , though it 's probably not installed by default . 
^ be sure to install the " latex " version of the package , and not just the " &name " version ! 
^ &website . 
^ to do an " article " ( a safe generic type of file ) in &name type , with my name included as the author and today 's date , my document has to open with the following code : 
^ documentclass [ &name &name leblanc } date { today } now , i start my document like all latex documents in &name : 
^ begin { document } 
^ from here , i add my actual content . 
^ just on a lark , i might just type something simple so i can test and make sure that everything 's working correctly : 
^ here 's my content . 
^ end { document } notice that i 've gone ahead and put the document closing code in there . 
^ now , i can save out the file and type latex test to see if everything works correctly . 
^ what i see in response is : 
^ &website . 
^ okay , so it 's not much to look at right now . 
^ but once i get to know all of those fun latex formatting commands , i 'm ready to start printing out those math-heavy papers .

^ &name &name writes : " i would love to see a &name type &name editor for &name . 
^ i think this would help get some more people on board with &name . 
^ i have seen coffee cup and bluefish , but they do n't seem to quite get there . 
^ the closest i have seen so far is quanta for &name . 
^ 'shall we petition &name for a &name build of &name ? 
^ would they do it open source ? " &name responds : 
^ i 'm a firm believer in letting companies know what we want . 
^ after all , they 're a business , and they do want to sell us things . 
^ they just have to know what we would buy . 
^ that 's the key , though . 
^ there would have to be enough of a market for &name under &name . 
^ if enough people write in to &name and ask for the product , who knows !

^ 'maybe everyone knows this , but it nagged a few of us &name &name guys for a while . 
^ when accessing my server via telnet ( or ssh ) all the man pages had odd characters in them , but they looked fine from the console .
