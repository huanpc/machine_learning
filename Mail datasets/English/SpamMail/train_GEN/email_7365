^ &name &name , &name you 've had a good first week . 
^ i had a card from &name &name saying he 'd met you : &name and i were ordained together and met several times in the late 1980's at post-ordination training - it 's a small world ! 
^ we wondered if we could call in on saturday &num october ; what we 'd envisage is to arrive late morning ( say around 11.30ish ) , take you out to lunch somewhere that you recommend , and then go on to &name in the middle of the afternoon . 
^ let us know if there 's a problem with the date ; we may be able to find an alternative . 
^ if you 've got lectures / classes / whatever up till lunchtime let us know and we can adjust timings accordingly ( your mum said &name had the uncivilised habit of &name 
^ rday morning teaching - &name never used to ! ) . 
^ it would be helpful also to know where to park - or whether it might be best to use the park & ride . 
^ anyway , enjoy yourself and we 'll look forward to seeing you . 
^ cheers , &name ( &name and sent to you using the &name &email )
