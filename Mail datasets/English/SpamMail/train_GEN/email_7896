^ hi &name : 
^ that was &name 's attempt at e-mail . 
^ he needs to enhance his typing skills , his fingers are a lot slower than his mouth . 
^ i phoned you a couple of times yesterday and the lines were busy . 
^ not sure if it was your phone line or the international lines . 
^ when &name 's sister &name came over , she said she could not get through to anyone all day , yet i had phoned gran , your dad and &name and had no trouble getting through . 
^ just as we were sitting down for christmas dinner &name &name &name phoned , so that was good for an hour and the dinner was almost ruined . 
^ but it was n't too bad even if everything was bunged into the oven when she phoned . 
^ &name gave me a book for christmas called &name &name 's chocolate recipes , so i 'll have to get started on them . 
^ gran gave &name a book on &name which even instructs you to try the hair of the dog the next day . 
^ i wonder if she 's trying to lead him even further astray . 
^ we still have a ton of snow and it 's freeezing . 
^ &name arrives from &name tomorrow , so he 'll notice quite the difference in the climate . 
^ i 'm back at work tomorrow but &name is off till the 3rd of january . 
^ will definitely get in touch at the weekend . 
^ ( by the time i get home from work , you are probably fast asleep ) 
^ &name . . . . . ... &name & &name
