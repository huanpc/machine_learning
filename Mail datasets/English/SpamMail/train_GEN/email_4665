^ hi &name , 
^ it looks as though the new tagger has slightly different behaviour than i expected : 
^ it ignores anything inside &name tags , whether the line begins with a 
^ or not . 
^ however , if the line does not begin with a 
^ it still tags it ( assuming it is not &name ) . 
^ it also concatenates all adjacent lines that do not begin with 
^ . 
^ plus , it does not print &name lines unless they occur adjacent to non-xml lines ( or are prefaced by 
^ ) . 
^ for example : 
^ ( &name ) text ( &num ) ( tag2 ) 
^ a line of text a line of text ( &num ) ( tag3 ) text ( &num ) 
^ becomes 
^ ( &name ) text ( &num ) ( tag2 ) 
^ 
^ a &name line &name of &name text nn1 &char at1 line &name of &name text &name ( &num ) 
^ whereas 
^ 
^ ( &name ) text ( &num ) 
^ ( tag2 ) 
^ a line of text 
^ a line of text 
^ ( &num ) 
^ ( tag3 ) text ( &num ) 
^ becomes 
^ 
^ 
^ ( &name ) text ( &num ) 
^ 
^ ( tag2 ) 
^ 
^ a &name line &name of &name text nn1 
^ 
^ a &name line &name of &name text nn1 
^ 
^ ( &num ) ( tag3 ) text ( &num ) 
^ thus it seems that in order to respect the line breaks , i will have to put the 
^ symbol in front of every line , including the &name . 
^ does this make sense , or do you think i 'm misjudging something ? 
^ thanks &name ,
