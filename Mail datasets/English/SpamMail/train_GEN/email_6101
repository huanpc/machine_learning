^ &name is it ok if we do this next term ? 
^ i have already got a fair few supervisions on next week and its a bit of a nightmare ... 
^ your first supervision could be next week , on thursday or friday , or it could be next term . 
^ which would you like , and do you have any preference on pairings ? 
^ if so , let me know , otherwise i will arbitrarily pair &name and dan+ed . 
^ please let me know your prefered pairings ( if not the &num suggested ) and whether each pair would like their first supervision to be next week or next term . 
^ the work for the first supervision is &num warmup questions and parts of &num exam questions . 
^ before you complain that i 've set &num exam questions for &num supervision , note that the parts i 've chosen only amount to &num marks , so it 's really not much more than &num questions . 
^ warmup questions ( a short paragraph each ) : &num / &num and &num / &num ( in the notes ) 
^ exam questions : &website ) &website 
^ the last &num of these are also available in the notes as questions &num / &num , &num / &num , and &num / &num . 
^ for the last one please can you answer the question for all &num co-ordinate systems , do n't just pick &num .
