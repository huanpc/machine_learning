^ i could come tonight but a bit reluctant if discussing things is mixed with playing go as that does n't always seem to work well for me ( if trying to do both at once , end up doing both badly ! ) . 
^ not sure exactly what you had in mind . 
^ if not today then best for me this week is thursday , preferably 8pm onwards . 
^ i do n't mind where we meet , except i 'd prefer somewhere not noisy ( e.g. &name &name ) rather than places with background music etc. here ( &num &name &name ) , apart from being presumably &char inconvenient for you is impossible as full of people .
