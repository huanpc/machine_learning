^ guys , 
^ &name news i 'm afraid . 
^ i have been a victim of goodness knows what types of viruses but also and rather annoyingly , i have been a victim of an email worm type thing . 
^ basically , if you do n't know , a virus type thing has been sending itself to everyone in my address book and obviously i got it from someone who had me in their address book and so forth . 
^ anyway , i 've been trying to fix this for about &num days or so and have finally now managed . 
^ the answer is pretty simple - go get the most up to date antivirus program available . 
^ so if you 've had problems with your computer and you were unprepared ( like me ) then i would recommend &name &name &num as it 's done the job for me . 
^ alternatively you could try downloading a free evaluate version from the web , i tried but it ( not surprisingly ) did n't work ... 
^ anyway , apologise again and i hope it was sifted out by your email providers . 
^ otherwise , i hope you 're all well !
