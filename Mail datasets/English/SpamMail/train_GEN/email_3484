" ^ then i got this email from  ame - i 'm posting the whole thing because it was so exciting , i know you guys will also be very excited ! : ^ " thank you so much for all your prayer support ! ! ^ the evening went so well - we really could feel that people were praying for us ! ^ i 'm awful at estimating numbers , but it least  um people , were in the bar and the majority stayed all evening . ^ this was really amazing as there was a playboys and playgirls party in a neighbouring hall , and many people decided to come to our grill  har christian instead of going ! ^ although there were a few people who were just there to start a debate , we were amazed at the number of people who were genuinely interested . ^ the evening started around 9pm and officially finished when the bar closed at  um , but people hung around outside until 12.30am asking us questions . ^ afterwards , everyone who took part was really excited and so encouraged about how open people had been . ^  um guy ,  ame , who is the 1st year  ame and well liked and respected by everyone stood up at the end and said " if you give christianity a chance , die and find out it 's all wrong , then all you 've lost is a few hours of your life . ^ if you do n't, you die and find out it 's true , then you 've lost everything . ^ why do n't you give it a go ? " . ^ he 's not a christian , and has some bizarre views , but he then passed us a note saying " where can i go to a church (  ame ) in  ame ? ^ - please write back " . ^ he 's coming to church tomorrow night and we are so excited . ^  ame could really use him to affect a lot of people ! ^ at the end , i was talking to  um guy ,  ame , and the conversation was just turning into a pointless debate . ^ he was fairly hostile , and kept repeating the same point several times . ^ i really felt  ame told me to pray for him , so i asked him if i could . ^ at first , he was a little confused , but agreed ... we prayed just for  um minute that  ame would really reveal himself to him , and show him his identity in  ame . ^ his attitude suddenly changed , he told us that we were absolutely fantastic ( he was a bit drunk ! ) and that he felt so loved . ^ he went away saying he was going to pray alone that if  ame exists he 'll show him . ^ how exciting ! ^ our dilemma now is how to follow the event up . ^ it 's only  um  um /  um weeks until we leave hall for the christmas holidays , and we 'd love to be able to do another hall event before then . ^ other prayer points are : ^ * that  ame will really equip the christians in the group to be able to answer the questions their friends have - people have been talking about it over the last couple of days ! ! ^ * that people will continue to ask questions and want to find out more ^ * that the guys who said they 'd come to church on sunday will come - and that they 'll be touched by  ame in such a mighty way . ^ pray especially for  ame and  ame - that  ame will reveal himself to them . ^ * that we 'll be able to do another event before christmas ^ please say a huge thank you to all your friends . ^ we feel so privileged to have had such a huge prayer network - and yes , we could feel it ! " ^ thank you for supporting their cu in prayer - they appreciate it very much and are really seeing  ame 's hand at work in that hall , which is notorious for having few christians and crazy parties ... so please keep on praying for them ! ^ take care and  ame bless love  ame xx </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ ( ) my  ame website )  ebsite / <text_embedded> ^ ( ) check out this site )  ebsite ^ * * " work like you do n't need money , love like you 've never been hurt , and dance like  um 's watching' * * </text_embedded></text_embedded><text_normal> ^ do you  ame ! ? ^  ame ! ^ mail plus powerful . ^  ame . ^ sign up now . ^  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
