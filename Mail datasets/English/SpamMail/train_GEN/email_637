^ dear &name , &name , well , i 'll start by apologising for the message i sent you- it was fairly nasty and i 'm sorry for the way in which i said things . 
^ but i wo n't apologise for the content , because it was true . 
^ firstly , &name asked me some days ago whether i would be able to come to a meal on the wednesday . 
^ i told her about college group and said that i could n't, so you all knew that i would n't be able to , and to be included in any kind of invitation list was just patronising . 
^ secondly , had i been arranging the meal , i would have made some kind of effort to re-arrange had one of you not been able to make it- to not even try is basically just saying that you 're not bothered whether i 'm there or not , which is not nice . 
^ thirdly , to say that you 'do n't understand " what &name and i were trying to say reads like this : " &name ca n't come to the meal , but i do n't want to take responsibility for her being hurt , so i 'll pretend i do n't know what 's going on " . 
^ i ca n't help wondering whether , had it been say , &name or &name who could n't have gone , whether you and &name would have made more of an effort to reschedule . 
^ i 'm sorry if this seems harsh , but i 'm just trying to be honest . 
^ i know you were upset by the email i sent you , but &name , if you do n't tell me , i ca n't even begin to respond . 
^ i mean , the ball was firmly in your court , to be honest- and what is friendship without honesty ? 
^ if you have a problem with something i do or say , you have to tell me . 
^ i know you 're shy , but ( and i 'm sorry to be blunt ) you 're going to have to make the effort . 
^ the only reason i can see for you not making any effort to talk to me about this is if you 're not bothered whether you 're friends with me or not . 
^ if this is the case , there 's nothing i can do to change your mind and i wo n't bother you ever again . 
^ but that would sadden me , because i do enjoy your company and i like spending time with you . 
^ but- and this is a big but- i wo n't have a one-sided friendship where i have to make every effort to see you , to apologise , to forgive first . 
^ if you wo n't make any effort with this , &name , there 's nothing i can do ; but i 'm not going to sit by and let your stubborness spoil your friendships . 
^ either we are honest with each other , and we tell each other when the other has done something " wrong " , and i try and get over my pride and you your shyness , or we are n't friends ; because i hate unreal friendships . 
^ i want you to be honest with me , and i will be with you . 
^ if you do n't reply to this email , i 'll know that you do n't want to be friends with me . 
^ if you do , let me know when you 're free , and we can meet up and talk about this , or just reply by email ... but only if honesty is on the agenda . 
^ i think you 'll probably be really annoyed when you read this , but take a few minutes to think over what i 've said- and i 've only said it because ( &char ) i want to be honest with you and ( &char ) i care about you and want you to be happy and fulfilled in your friendships . 
^ just tell me what you think- say anything ! 
^ i do want to see you ... and i guess i 'll know by tomorrow whether you feel the same . 
^ with love , &name x
