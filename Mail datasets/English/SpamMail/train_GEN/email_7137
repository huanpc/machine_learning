^ i just downloaded &name , and had a finished product in less than half an hour , and that 's with my normal fussing and tweaking . 
^ this is an excellent product - how can you give it away ? ! ? 
^ also , the wizard works perfectly , and is the best one i 've seen . 
^ i deliberately did n't read any help or readme files or anything , and i was able to just run through the menus , then run through the wizard , with no problems . 
^ excellent work ! 
^ are you still supporting this product ? 
^ if so , and if i find any bugs or have ideas for enhancements , i 'll let you know . 
^ thanks again .
