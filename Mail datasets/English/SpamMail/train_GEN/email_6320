^ hi . 
^ my name is &name &name , and i 'm a sophomore at &name college . 
^ i know &name &name ... ( i put the ... there because i can never spell her last name ) and she told me that you 're a &name major at &name university and that you 're extremely helpful . 
^ like every &name college student , i want to apply to &name to study a year abroad , and i wanted to know more information about the computer science department and the economics department . 
^ if you can give me any information about those departments ( or just cs departments ) , like what courses you recommend , if there are internship opportunities around that area ( both research and business ) , and if i have any chance in studying both cs and econ while i 'm at &name ( that 's assuming that i get in. .
