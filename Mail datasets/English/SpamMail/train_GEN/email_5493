^ this show will be an improvised production , run along the lines of the famous tv show , and provides an opportunity for anyone to have a go at technical theatre even if you 've never done anything before . 
^ in addition , you get to watch a performance which promises to be entertaining and spontaneous - last year a member of the crew ending up on the stage breaking up a fight !

^ &name , an improvised pantomime by the uncertainty division ( we did no second thoughts at the &name last march ) . 
^ seeks technical crew 
^ since this is an improvised show , we 're obviously looking for people who are perfectly comfortable working without a script or any real idea what might happen . 
^ in addition , we 're really looking for people who are going to get involved in our workshop process throughout the term so that the entire cast and crew is used to working together as a team ( this should n't be a huge onus on you , but we will certainly want you in rehearsals about once a week ) . 
^ the nature of the show means that we 're also somewhat hazy ( or perhaps just flexible ) about what we need from our crew . 
^ currently we 're thinking in terms of a &name / &name and &name , but if you have want to get involved in a different capacity , drop me a line . 
^ we already have someone who will be doing sound improvisation with us , so we may not need a separate sound operator . 
^ again , if you feel you could contribute something to the show on the sound front , feel free to persuade me . 
^ we will expect you to be experienced with whatever role you 're wanting to do : the ideal people will come on board with a whole bunch of ideas that we have n't considered , which will presumably require a fairly solid background in doing more straightforward shows . 
^ please contact me at &email or ring me on &num &num ; if you 're interested .
