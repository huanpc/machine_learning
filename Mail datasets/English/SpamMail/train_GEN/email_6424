^ important ! 
^ this message has been blind-carbon-copied to you . 
^ do not reply-to-all or forward it without the author 's permission . 
^ sorry- you should have got a text message from me on saturday evening about this ... only i forgot- sorry ! 
^ do you think it 's ok to have a &char short interval ? 
^ i do think people will need one ... also , it 'll need to go in the programme- at the moment , it 's been put in after part &num , with &name 's 2nd talk coming afterwards , just before part &num . 
^ how does that sound to you ? 
^ also , do you know whether the soloists are aware that they 're entitled to &num free full price / conc tickets each- for parents / friends ? 
^ and had we told you that you get &num free tickets too ? 
^ probably the most reliable way of getting them to the right people is for me to give them to the soloists themselves at a rehearsal- prob the one on thursday- if they 'd like them . 
^ i think that 's all for now , have fun tonight &smiley love &name

^ just to confirm - there is no official interval is there ? 
^ there 'll be breathinig spaces between the sections , but we 're not going to get all the audience to go out are we ?

^ i think we originally agreed that we 'd have a &num minute interval , which i was kinda assuming you 'd put between the &num parts ( hence &name 's query yesterday ) . 
^ do you want to scrap that in favour of just some breathing space ? 
^ i am just aware that it is a reasonable length performance and some might want to use the toilets / have a quick break . 
^ it is however entirely up to you . 
^ i do though need to know asap &num way or the other what you want so i can produce proofs of the programme . 
^ thanks ,
