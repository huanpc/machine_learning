^ hi &name ... 
^ here is the passage for this week . 
^ we 're looking at chapter &num . 
^ there is a link below to the commentary on this passage which might also be good to look at . 
^ commentaries are great because they put things in perspective and context . 
^ so if you could read at least the passage before hand ( whether online or in your bible , &name ! ) and if you want the commentary too , then we can bash around some ideas and thoughts about what is being said . 
^ i hope your quiet times are going well as well . 
^ please pray for mine , as i have n't been able to concentrate very well . 
^ you guys are a great group ! 
^ lots of love , &name

^ 1brothers , if someone is caught in a sin , you who are spiritual should restore him gently . 
^ but watch yourself , or you also may be tempted . 
^ 2carry each other 's burdens , and in this way you will fulfill the law of &name . 
^ &name anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing , he deceives himself . 
^ 4each one should test his own actions . 
^ then he can take pride in himself , without comparing himself to somebody else , 5for each one should carry his own load . 
^ 6anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor . 
^ &name not be deceived : &name cannot be mocked . 
^ a man reaps what he sows . 
^ 8the &num who sows to please his sinful nature , from that nature [ &num ] will reap destruction ; the one who sows to please the &name , from the &name will reap eternal life . 
^ 9let us not become weary in doing good , for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up . 
^ 10therefore , as we have opportunity , let us do good to all people , especially to those who belong to the family of believers . 
^ not circumcision but a new creation 
^ 11see what large letters i use as i write to you with my own hand ! 
^ 12those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised . 
^ the only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of &name . 
^ 13not even those who are circumcised obey the law , yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh . 
^ 14may &num never boast except in the cross of our &name &name &name , through which [ &num ] the world has been crucified to me , and &num to the world . 
^ 15neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything ; what counts is a new creation . 
^ 16peace and mercy to all who follow this rule , even to the &name of &name . 
^ 17finally , let no one cause me trouble , for &num bear on my body the marks of &name . 
^ 18the grace of our &name &name &name be with your spirit , brothers . 
^ amen .
