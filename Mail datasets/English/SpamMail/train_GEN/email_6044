^ &name , 
^ i 've spoken to &name and &name about the &name study group . 
^ they did n't want any round exam times but i think we eventually decided to try and start as soon as possible , have &num or &num , maybe break for exams ( see how its going ) , then start again when exams are over . 
^ saturday morning at &num : &num was a possible time , though i think we are all pretty free most of the time . 
^ there are &num sessions in &name 's study course ( if thats what we are doing ? ) so we could hopefully fit them all in this term ... &name said he would love to be involved and maybe lead it if we 're still looking for someone to do that ? 
^ anyway , let me know what you think . 
^ perhaps we could meet up sometime to talk about it ? 
^ cheers , &name 
^ outgoing mail is certified virus free . 
^ checked by &name anti-virus system ( &website ) .
