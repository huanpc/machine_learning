^ weekend &num / &num : probably not weekend &num / &num / &num : best for me weekdays : nah ! 
</text_embedded>

^ so , yes , i probably will be able to make the weekend everyone else seems keen on ( apart from &name and &name ) , but it will depend on train costs ( which i 'll now investigate ; i am skint ) and who else goes . 
^ you know i 'd love to see you all , but the incentive to go would be even greater if i knew that &name and &name were going as i wo n't see them for ages if they do n't, and i will be seeing you others &num weeks later ! 
^ can you make it you guys ? 
^ hope so . 
^ keep me posted . 
^ bye for now , love you all , &name xxx 
^ ps - i 'm seeing &name on wednesday ! 
^ &name and &name &char are going to see the &name match at &name &name " park on wed night , so &name is coming to see me then ! 
^ get your free download of &name explorer at &website
