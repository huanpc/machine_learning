^ how successful are the different offerings , and what issues face anyone trying to bring &name 's work to a broadcast medium ? 
^ got any bright ideas about how a particular book ought to be serialised or filmed ? 
^ come along and join the discussion ! 
^ we will be meeting in room &name , &name 's college , for which directions are given below .
