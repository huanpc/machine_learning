^ hi &name : 
^ thanks for the anniversary wishes . 
^ you were pretty , pretty close to getting it right , our anniversary is on thursday , november 23rd . 
^ after &num years with &name it 's a wonder that anybody gets it right . 
^ we got the card from your dad as well , he 's getting very good at sending musical cards . 
^ i do n't know where he finds them all . 
^ we were in &name last weekend , i went down to &name on the thursday as it was the &name employees who have been with the company for over &num year 's annual dinner . 
^ ( the old fogies club a.k.a. the old fools club ) we had a great time , drank far too much and suffered the next day . 
^ i had some business to attend to on the friday but &name came down on the friday night and we went to the hockey game . 
^ we stayed over in &name till sunday , so all in all it was a nice weekend . 
^ this week is kind of busy as i 'm quite busy at work , i 'm also organizing a retirees luncheon in &name this friday and we have company coming from &name on friday for the weekend . 
^ because i 've got company coming , i 've got to clean the house , do shopping ( which did n't get done this weekend ) and do christmas shopping for the &name &name . 
^ i wish i was more organized . 
^ i 've got the retiree luncheon organized okay i think but am going to get shit from our human resources department as i 'm sure i 'm well over budget . 
^ although it 's their own blame as they keep changing things and they probably should n't be involved in the first place . 
^ what are you going to do for christmas ? 
^ are you going to go up to &name and spend the day with &name and your favourite cousin ? 
^ we wo n't be going to &name or the &name for christmas unless &name wins the lottery . 
^ i 'm not sure what we 're doing yet . 
^ the weather has changed and got a lot colder . 
^ &name said on thursday night it was a blizzard in &name , &name was cold but was n't snowing . 
^ &name , which is a fair bit north of here , got &num feet of snow today . 
^ do n't work too hard and look after yourself . 
^ talk to you soon . 
^ &name 
^ &name & &name
