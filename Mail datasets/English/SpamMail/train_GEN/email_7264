^ hello everybody , 
^ &name unfortunately had to go down ( home ) before being able to see this thing through so that 's why it 's coming from me . 
^ we thought we 'd thank &name for her hard work and dedication over the past year as head chapel clerk , and present her with a card expressing our gratitude . 
^ it would be great , if you 're still in college , if you could sign the card ! 
^ the card is in my pigeon-hole . 
^ i do n't know when &name is going home , so i suggest a deadline of tomorrow ( friday ) noon . 
^ after lunch , i 'll pop the card into her pigeon-hole . 
^ &name &name .
