^ dear &name and &name , 
^ thank you for the messages you left on my door . 
^ i assume they were from you as they had your names after them . 
^ if they were forged then please ignore this e-mail . 
^ why does everyone ask me where i am today ? 
^ lectures have started - of course ! 
^ i have put some pictures up on my walls &name , and &name says my room now passes . 
^ &name . 
^ i still have a long way to go though . 
^ you both may be interested to know ( though i doubt it ) that &name ( also known as " that horrible stuffed creature " ) has now found a permanent home with our intrepid &name &name who , incidentally , was mortified that he received no messages when you had both been so close to his room ( a feat of tremendous endurance in itself and really he ought n't ask for any more ) . 
^ hope you are both well and had enjoyable days , 
^ love &name
