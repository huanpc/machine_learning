^ hi 
^ hope you had a good vac 
^ any preference for dr &char sups ? 
^ since it 's likely to be in &name ( given &name 's e-mail ) , i suggest &name , since we 're out at &name monday until &name , so mon pm would seem more sensible for arranging sups out there rather than in college . 
^ personal pref would be &num &name , but its up to you
