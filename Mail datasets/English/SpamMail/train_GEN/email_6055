^ dear all , 
^ ( if you 've not much time : summary : do you know of a good book which outlines the evidence for the resurrection that 's suitable for a non-christian . 
^ i 'm quite happy to go and buy a copy of it if you can give me a title , thanks ) . 
^ first off sorry to email so many of you but i really wanted to try and get an answer pretty fast . 
^ i 've just had quite a long conversation with &name ( first year &name &name , close friend of karuna 's) in which we got on to christianity , why she did n't believe , why i did believe . 
^ it cumulated in talking about the resurrection , i pointed to that as the proof of &name " claims , of the truth of christianity . 
^ she asked if the only evidence for that was the bible so i talked about the reaction of the disciples and the absence of a body . 
^ i noted that there was a lack of serious secular literature on the subject , because people who investigated it seriously had this habit of becoming christians . 
^ i then asked if she 'd be interested if i could give her some literature outlining the evidence for the resurrection and she said she would be interested . 
^ hence the request : anyone know a good book on the subject i can get for her ? 
^ and the reason for urgency : i 'd like to get it for her before she forgets she asked for it , hopefully while our conversation is still on her mind . 
^ finally it would be really good to pray for her . 
^ thanks , &name 
^ &name : maybe this is already obvious to everyone but i 'll just say it : it probably would n't be the most sensitive and helpful think to say to her " i hear you 've been talking to &name about the ressurection " , but to let her bring it up if she wants to . 
^ ( i.e. : treat this email with a degree of confidentiality ) .
