^ are you thinking about staying on to do a ph. &char in either the &org or the department of engineering ? 
^ it is essential if you have any leanings towards a ph. &char , or even if you just want to discuss the possibility , that you contact the relevant department approaching an individual staff member but also by making a formal application . 
^ you will need to apply to continue as a graduate student ( see &website for details ) and use the appropriate form available from the &org . 
^ the course organisers wish to point out that quite apart from your own enthusiasm and merits , there are may other relevant constraints on being accepted , notably whether there is an appropriate supervisor with spare capacity available and space , and , of course , &name support . 
^ the engineering department and &org receive many applications which may pre-empt supervisors , space and grants , and you should therefore make an early application , although a potential supervisor will probably not make a decision until he / she has a clear idea of your achievement on the course . 
^ the detailed administrative position about accepting you for doctoral work is also complicated by the fact that many decisions on the award of &name , &name and other grants will have been taken before you have done your project work and completed your dissertation . 
^ you cannot , therefore , rely on your dissertation as evidence of your capacity for research : you have to carry conviction to your potential doctoral supervisor before that , and of course , the examinations and coursework assessment will be taken into account . 
^ please do not operate on the basis of inference , presumption , or &name gossip about the status of departments or supervisors . 
^ at least raise the matter properly with a qualified member of staff , and make a formal application using the form from the &org , as this will ensure that your application is seriously made and seriously treated . 
^ if you would like a copy of the current graduate studies &name and the &org 's " blue book " please see &name &name in &name administration , ( fc06 ) .
