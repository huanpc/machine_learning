^ " scuse me , but i have n't been particularly evil recently . 
^ just generally moody . 
^ but that 's &name 's fault cuz he 's a wank . 
^ yes . ... yes he is . 
^ ( &name , who does that phrase remind me of ? 
^ he he ) oh and please do n't read this email out to mam this time . 
^ i 'm not impressed . 
^ i need a chance to moan every so often ok ? 
^ it just happens to be every email . 
^ he is actually that annoying . 
^ tonight he was kind enough to inform me that &name amd i had could use the tv upstairs if we wanted , but he was using the one in the basement to watch his hockey , of course . 
^ so he married her but i have to sit and watch tv with her . 
^ &name , tempting but i think i 've got better things to do . 
^ turns out me and &name are going to the picters anyway . 
^ do n't know what we 're seeing . 
^ &name is n't out til the 16th which sucks , especially when that 's &name 's last day and she expects me to come out with her and her colleauges ( how the hell do you spell that word ? ) , eh work mates to the pub . 
^ do n't particularly want to anyway but do that instead of &name ? 
^ i think not . 
^ &name &name i 'm sure i will make an extra effort to be feeling very evil when he 's aboot . 
^ he will definitely not be safe . 
^ especially when i tell &name a guff is staying in my hoose for hogmanay . 
^ the disgrace . 
^ never be able to lift my head in public again . 
^ &name well . 
^ &name does indeed happen . 
^ even to the best of us ... whoever that may be . 
^ my god i 'm speaking crap tonight . 
^ the brain has turned to mush after my exam yesterday . 
^ which i will not talk about . 
^ do n't even want to think about it . 
^ you had the right story by the way . 
^ that was pretty much it . 
^ the gay club happened to be the next club down the street from the one where i was too short so &name ( from &name ) wanted to go in cuz they 'd been to a gay bar in montreal and said it was magic so we went . 
^ and it was magic . 
^ i 'm guessing you were told about one of the guy 's we were speaking to as well but i 'll tell you again anyway . 
^ this guy asked where we were from and when we said &name he 's like " oh i love &name &name " and i 'm like " ooh , me too' . 
^ too funny . 
^ what email of &name 's are you talking about ? 
^ i probably got it but i get so much crap from her i forget easily . 
^ i still have n't heard of that ska punk band . 
^ i will look into it . 
^ and i ca n't believe you say &name . 
^ one of the soundtrack songs to my summer . 
^ &name . 
^ and &name &name . 
^ &name " in the &num ! 
^ &name . 
^ there 's heaps of stuff i want for &name but it 's all here . 
^ but i spose i could get it then get money or whatever . 
^ i was just going to get presents for everyone here cuz i 've seen so much cool stuff but we could get bits on both sides of the watter . 
^ &name said before i left she wanted a dodgers cap but i do n't know if she still does . 
^ i 'll ask . 
^ so far i have a photo of &name looking &char sexy pour ma &name , a western tshirt for dad and a print for &name . 
^ i was also thinking of getting &name the &num soundtracks for &name and confused cuz he seems to be into his &num music just now . 
^ i can get them cheap through &name 's &name club which would be good . 
^ do you want a voodoo &name kit ? 
^ i found &num last week and i 'm dying to give it to someone but i do n't know who 'd want it . 
^ must think . 
^ tell me what you think . 
^ but actually , i do n't know if i can afford any presents . 
^ i was &char bad today . 
^ went shopping and went past this underwear shop like &name &name . 
^ anyway , they had a deal on tartan pjs so i went in for them then had a look around and the woman was so nice and told me about a special deal they had going on underwear and she was so nice and encouraged me to try on all this stuff and i could n't resist the &char nice &name &name sets . 
^ so i spent $ &num . 
^ &char &char &name . 
^ although it 's really good compared to what i would have spent at home . 
^ but still . 
^ the woman must have spotted me as a sucker then as i was paying she gave me a couple of catalogues . 
^ no no no . 
^ i will resist . 
^ but some of teh stuff is sooo nice . 
^ &name oh .

^ oh &name is now cancelled . 
^ did i tell you it was postponed cuz of an illness ? 
^ think i did . 
^ but apparently they could n't fit in another date cuz they cancelled a few shows . 
^ bastards . 
^ i 'm so annoyed . 
^ and to make matters worse , &name of the rings comes out on the 19th dec. yes , of course , the day after i fly home .
