^ hi guys , 
^ how are you ? 
^ what have you been up to this holiday ? 
^ the reason i 'm writting ( and indeed , sending this to all of you as i 'm not sure which of you read your email over the holidays ) is that i really do need some details for the houseparty ( also visiting a friend 's church i met a guy who was going to &name this year and also wanted some details about the houseparty so i said i 'd see what i could do for him ) . 
^ time and place would be especially useful . 
^ &name
