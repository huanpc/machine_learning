^ in writing some pseudocode for the server-side parser , the box group were wondering if some slight modifications could be made to what the &name group writes to the database . 
^ there are &num changes : 
^ &num ) instead of having type information stored in the database separately from the predicate / function string , we were wondering if the predicate / function 'modifier " strings contain this information directly . 
^ in other words , instead of writing " age ) &num " to the database , we would prefer " : &char : &num : &num : ) &num " gets written where &char stands for integer ( &char for float , &char for string etc ) , &num stands for the offset within the tuple string , and &num stands for the size ( number of characters ) of that attribute . 
^ in this way , we do n't have to read from the database more than once ( just to get the original sting ) which would save time when parsing . 
^ &num ) if the type of a constant is a float , we were hoping it would be wriiten to the database string with a decimal point . 
^ thus , if the user wrote " price - &num " it would be written as " : &char : &num : &num : - &num " ( notice the &num added to the &num ) . 
^ please let us know if these changes are possible . 
^ thanks , &name
