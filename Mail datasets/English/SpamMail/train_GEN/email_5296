^ i have n't actually seen any past papers on underspecification , so i do n't know what the precedent is . 
^ i would have thought something like : 
^ - &name , using suitable logical formulae , the possible &name for the following sentence : 
^ " every cat gave some dog a mouse " 
^ - what are the benefits of underspecifying scope in such situations ? 
^ - show an underspecified representation for the semantics of the above sentence , and explain any constraints . 
^ - some other question with a bit of a twist perhaps . 
^ that is a total guess , but it 's the best i can do ! 
^ i 'm sure you 'll be absolutely fine &name ! 
^ speak soon , 
^ &name
