^ a message from &name &name and &name &name : 
^ hi &name , it 's present time ! ! ! 
^ as you may or may not recall just before the last house party &name and &name had an obsession with tea towels , i made it at least &num emails on the subject ! ! 
^ so , what &name and i thought we could do is , get everyone in the cu to draw a little face and sign their name , on a tea towel , a la primary school ( great idea or what ! ! ).so they will remember us all . 
^ so we have bought the aforementioned teatowels and would be very much grateful if you could mark them with you own distinguishable creative drawing talent . 
^ the tea towels will be in &name room , which is crudas c17 , its right in the corner and it says " &name and &name " on the door , ( cunning ! ) so please pop along and sign them , there are one each for &name and &name , there are also cards for you to sign . 
^ before the &name lot start whinging the tea towels will be in &name &char on thurs and fri , so you could pop along then . 
^ if you want to do it , then plaease can you do it before monday . 
^ thanks alot , sorry to have wittered on
