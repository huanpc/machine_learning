^ i have n't showered in &num days ! 
^ all the whores i tried to bring back to my hostel took &num smell and refused to come back with me ! 
^ but i 'm touched that you only sort of want me to make love with mad whores . 
^ yeah , the rest of the trip was nice , but not nearly as cool without you . 
^ you really are a great person to travel with - i ca n't imagine the trip being nearly as fun if you did n't accompany me . 
^ things kept on happening that i knew you would find really funny and i was wishing you could be there to laugh with me . 
^ like the oldish man on the plane sitting next to me happily reading his playboy magazine ( and then trying to block my view when i tried to look at it over his shoulder ) . 
^ or my ordeal in trying to get into &name ( i ended up having to hitchhike as part of my attempt to get accross the border ) . 
^ or me running out of &name when i had to pay for my hostel ( i needed my sugar mummy ) . 
^ anyway , it 's nice to be back home ( and have dedicated &name access ! ) 
^ i agree we should write another shocker to &name . 
^ i will hold off on my response until you get back . 
^ i hope your show goes well tomorrow night &smiley love , &name

^ it 's weird not being with you now . 
^ &char miss you is n't that redonculous . 
^ &name 's response was satisfying enough but i think we need to join our resources and write another shocker . 
^ bye bye for now , &name
