^ hi &name , 
^ &website last night and looking at your software / " comments " from users , could not help noticing the one that said " i was offended by the bible verses " i wrote a review ( liked the software by the way ) just so i could make some kind of statement back to that posting , my alias name on the post is " offended not " , but anyways , thanks for putting the bible verses in , i love it when people will allow almost any other content to be displayed , but show something that pertains to &name and " christianity / &name " and you have gone too far , their reaction to that really shows to me , a lot about the power of &name , and the conviction his word has on people ( else why would n't they just ignore it , just as if you had put a quote from &name and &name and they did n't like the cartoon , or some eastern philosophy quote , they would just ignore it , but mention &name or christianity and they have a fit . 
^ anyway i am rambling on , i was saved born / again when i was &num yrs old , turning &num next year ! 
^ " for love shall cover the multitude of sins " . 
^ ( &num &name &num : &num ) that was always one of my favorites . 
^ enjoyed the software , keep up the good work ! 
^ &name
