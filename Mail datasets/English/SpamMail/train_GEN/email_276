( to provide emotional interest ) - ) character interaction and development ( to provide commitment and involvment ) - ) evolving story ( to provide commitment and involvment ) - ) fantacy setting ( to provide escapism ) - ) historical settings ( to provide interesting information ) - ) logical puzzles ( to provide intellectual stimulation ) - ) learning e.g. mythology , history , science . ^ ( to provide intellectual stimulation ) - ) combat should be presented only if rational and well integrated into the story ( because violence must be justified ) . ^ - ) no difficult real-time combat in adventure games ( as this is disliked ^ by adventure games player regardless of gender . ) ^ now some stuff about indian software / games development ( you 've probably read this ) it 's from  ebsite ^ the games software industry in  ame is expected to grow to $  um mill . ^ within the next  um years , - hence awareness about gaming in  ame is raised ( you need gaming-aware people to build successful games ) . ^ hm ... reading this it seems more and more like this is the article you 've based your stuff on ... so i 'll leave it at that . ^ and some suggestions for you to reject about the name : ^  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ( after the rocket used by the russians in ww2 )  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ^ enjoy . ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
