</text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ^ - really good ! ! ^ i loved every minute of it , and the plane did n't crash - so i 'm here to tell the tale ! ^ i ca n't remember which day i sent your postcard , so am not sure what i told you about . ^ well , here 's a quick low-down :  ame - flew there : very exciting to see  ame  ame from the air , and we had lots of exciting turbulence too ! ^  ame - went to the beaches nearby , and explored  ame  ame sat - hired bikes and cycled round the coast . ^ got soaked as it rained . ^  ame - went to the anglican service in a little chapel at the old monastry in  ame  ame . ^ really nice . ^ spent the afternoon reading some of "  ame for today " by the pool . ^ mon - got a local bus service to the capital :  ame . ^ really wierd place . ^ half occupied by the turks . ^ the city is split in  um and  ame peace keeping troops maintain a buffer zone between the  um parts . ^ all very strange . ^  ame - supposed to go on a jeep safari trip to the  ame mountains . ^ got up to meet the jeep for  um , but after waiting an hour we gave up and managed to contact the bloke we booked it through . ^ he investigated it and found that the company had mixed the dates and though we were booking for the wed instead . ^ so , we spent the  ame in getting the bus to  ame ( nearby city which we flew to ) and exploring round there . ^ wed - got our jeep safari to the  ame ! ! ^ was really really good . ^ stopped off at different places to see the sights of  ame etc. was a really lovely day : but very long ! ! ^ we got up at  um ( the eqivalent of  um british time ) and i never slept again until  um pm on the thursday ! ! ! ! ^ our flight out of  ame was at 12.55pm on the wed , so we were up all night travelling . ^ it was impossible to sleep on the plane as it was so exciting and there is so little room to relax . ^ got into  ame at 3.30am and then had to get the train to  ame  ame and hang about for our  um train home to  ame . ^ got back at 11am and spent the rest of the day shopping for my mam 's birthday present ! ! </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ what have you been up to since you returned ? ^ i just got back last night . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ^ - lazed around like a bit of a zombie on friday . ^ went to  ame on sat . ^ was mam 's birthday and we went to see  ame and  ame to celebrate it with them . ^ rather horrid news on the  ame front . ^ he has been diagnosed as having lung cancer , and it is spreading : has invaded his nerves and also invaded a rib . ^ looks pretty bad , but he is going into hospital on wed to have an operation on thursday . ^ they are going to open him up to try and find out more about the cancer , and hopefully to remove some of it too . ^ then he 'll start having kemo- ( if that 's how you spell it ) and radiotherapy . ^ they have warned him that the effects of this could be rather nasty and he is likely to be quite ill from it . ^  ame  ame . ^ i feel so cross and angry that such a wonderful and loving guy , who has looked after his body and never done anything to encourage it ( like smoking ) should get such a nasty thing as lung cancer . ^ very challenging stuff for my faith , i can tell you . ^ i love him very dearly , and to see him and  ame suffering and being so brave about it is really heart-renching and also very humbling . ^ they have such a strong faith - it is a real example , and i 've learnt a lot from their witness . ^ please pray for them both . ^ i truly believe he can be cured , and that  ame will hear our desperate cries . ^ but , if not , then we 'll just have to accept that its  ame 's will , and  ame 's will be done . ^ at present though , it 's  um day at a time . . . ... ^ sunday was nice . ^ got a  ame  ame egg . ^ shocking : that was n't the best bit ! ! ^ our morning service was lovely , and then we had the sword family (  ame ,  ame and their sons  ame and  ame ) back to ours for lunch . ^ then in the evening service we had a few visitors who are from a men 's hostel in the area . ^ an inmate had died this week and dad had invited his friends to come to church . ^  um guy who came was the dead man 's room mate and was really cut up about it . ^ he was pretty gone with drink , but was realy to listen attentively to dad 's sermon , and kept shouting out questions to dad about his grief and what did  ame care etc. dad did an impromtu sermon alteration and focused a lot upon the love of  ame and how  ame understands and itentifies with our feelings and emotions as he was a man with feelings too . ^ it was great , and the guy seemed to like what he heard . ^ he said he 'd come back too . ... hopefully in a bit more of a sober state then ! ^ yesterday we went to  ame again ! ! ^ this time to  ame . ^ very nice . ^  ame today ! </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ i had a lovely holiday in  ame  ame , and i sent you a postcard , which you might hopefully get before you go back to  ame ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ooh goody ! ^ glad you had a nice time . ^ have n't got the postcard yet . ^ our post has been really weird recently . ^ we sent mam and dad several postcards from  ame and none of them had arrive by the time we got back . ^ one of them came on friday , but that was one which was written after the first few : which are still to arrive . ^ bugs in the system ! </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ i have been revising organic chemistry for a week . . . ... and i 'm pleased to say i am enjoying it ... </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ what 's the secret  ame ? ^ how can you enjoye revision ? ^ i want to know . ^ revision is driving me nuts , and i 've hardly done any ! </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ i have also been moping over the demise of  ame and the ascendancy of  ame . ^ oh dear , change again . ^  ame really ought to have tried harder . ^ the mass populace (  ame ) thinks she 's old and past-it . ^  ame seems to have all the appeal these days . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ^ - yes . ^  ame told me he was getting a new lap-top . ^ so , he 's named the thing  ame has he ? ^ how 's the step ? ^ when are you back in  ame ? ^ i 'm going on friday , and spending saturday writing up my  ame project . ^ i am determined to get it done then . ^ well , i really have spent far too long writing emails . ^ my  ame is feebly calling for my return . ^ bye for now ,  ame get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
