^ first of all , 
^ hi every &num , hope you all had a restful and enjoyable holiday . 
^ &name on to business , would anyone be interested in an informal pub meet up some time next week ( preferably a week day as everyone seems to have rather full social calenders ) ? 
^ i have contacted a few people , and the consensus seems to be , that the best idea would be to meet up in &name ( at about 8ish ) and just take it from there , depending on who turns up . 
^ what days would suit people ? 
^ so far some people ( and myself ) have problems with monday , and the only other day to be avoided would be friday due to &name " rather over draconian door policy at the weekends . 
^ if you are interested , send me an email with the days you can make .
