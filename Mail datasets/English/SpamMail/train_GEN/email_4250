^ welcome back boys . 
^ &name ur all well and ready to get back into things . 
^ i know it will be a hassle but i think we all need to work off some of the bad habits we may have got into over the hols . 
^ the first training session is on monday and looks like we may have a game versus &name on the wednesday . 
^ i need to know that everyone wil be there on monday . 
^ time will be given at a later date . 
^ secondly , as i mentioned at the end of last term , it is intended to have a barbeque in the summer term and so we need to improve on fines . 
^ there are still a few fines to be owed by everyone as wellas printing costs on drinking shirts ( not much ) . 
^ what &char suggest is that we each put in &pound; &num to the fines &name and build up enough funds to have an awesome get together maybe also later this term . 
^ therefore , i need everyone to bring &pound; &num to training . 
^ see you monday boys . 
^ any problems , get in touch asap . 
^ i need to know whose not available . 
^ the fury . 
^ add photos to your e-mail with &name &num . 
^ get &num months free * .
