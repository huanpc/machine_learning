^ it a store that caters to the rock &char " roll types . 
^ i bought a &name system for my speaking engagements there . 
^ interesting place anyways . 
^ have n't been too productive the past several weeks i 'm afraid . 
^ just getting back on my feet after a bout with some mysterious sort of " viral infection " ( so says my doctor ... that 's what they call something when they 're clueless ) so i set the script aside again . 
^ working on a commissioned painting instead . 
^ &name i 've covered everything .
