^ hi &name , excellent to hear that i can get away with being waffly , 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name &name , do not apologise for such a great e-mail ! 
^ i am here all alone at the moment ( for the next few days ? , and you made me smile , laugh and go " praise &name ! " 
^ i 'm so glad that &name was what it was . 
^ just reading through your message made me think 'man ! 
^ this girl is on fire ! " so either you have really been booted up the rear , or you are a great actor ! 
^ thanks for sharing all that with me ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name , &name , it was good to tell someone ! 
^ i am so scared : i 'm going a talk on what i did in &name and giving my testimony at church in september , in front of my parents and sister and everything and i really hate talking about anything in front of them . 
^ also &name is going to be there , which is another worry . 
^ i really need &name 's courage on this one ! 
^ still , what 's the worst that can happen ? 
^ i get embarassed . 
^ and i 'm used to that ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i know what you mean by promises - we are so bad at keeping them . 
^ what do you think makes us break them ? 
^ some thoughts i just had ; perhaps we are so bad at keeping promises because we do n't really have the heart to keep them . 
^ we have lived so long not in line with &name that we have really forgotten what an amazing privaledge it is to be his children . 
^ it is like we have gone off the path of righteousness ( see early proverbs ) and gone the crooked , hard way with lots of boulders in our path , and lots of darkness , so we ca n't see anything . 
^ it is hard going that way , but we are somehow drawn to it , i do n't know why ! 
^ still , even though we make a promise to turn around , it is sometimes a long time until we get back to the right path , and i think that is why we keep breaking out , turning around and running back down the stupid dark evil path ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ well we are fallen creatures . 
^ we have that in our nature to rebel and go and do what we want . 
^ that 's why we break promises . 
^ but i do n't think &name wants us to say to him " look , &name i promise never to fall away from your path again , i 'll always pray &num times a day and be full of love for my fellow man &num hours a day for the rest of my life " . 
^ yes , he wants us to do all those things but even if we say that we will never keep it , and then when we do break it we 'll feel guilty ( another sin , so i 'm told ) and be separated from &name even more . 
^ so i think that a better way of seeing renewed obedience to &name is not in terms of promises , which we break and which just drive us further away , but in terms of a decision to persevere towards the way &name wants us to be . 
^ that way we will be moving forward even though we fail and our feelings of guilt will not be as much because we recognise our faliures . 
^ i think that 's a heathier attitude . 
^ with promises it 's like you 're ignoring the fact you have these certain flaws , and with a decision you give &name the chance to show you and solve your flaws by acknowleging them . 
^ if that makes any sense at all ! 
^ also , &name talks about the wide gate and the narrow gate . 
^ so few will find the path to righteousness because actually ( do n't we all know ! ) it 's really hard to follow &name when the path of least resistance is the wide way of sin . 
^ sin 's just less effort to do . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i wonder why &name does n't always immediatly bring us back into a perfect relationship with him . 
^ is it because sometimes he wants us to realise just how far away from him we have got ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ probably ! 
^ but how is it &name 's place to bring us back to where we were before and closer ? 
^ i mean , we 're the &num who 've moved not &name . 
^ so do n't we have to make the effort to rebuild our closeness with &name ourselves by bringing ourselves closer to him ? 
^ i 've had a similar experience to this 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ recently , and thankfully , ( &name &name ) i feel like i 'm just about back on the path , but am scared that for some reason i may slip and fall back into the darkness , like it is pulling me down off the side of the path . 
^ i do n't want to fall , but it sometimes feels like i am being dragged off by some tenticles of darkness . 
^ sounds dramatic , eh ? 
^ it is also scary sometimes , but i keep praying , " &name , please keep me pure and holy , give me the strength to walk your way ! " . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i do know what you mean ! 
^ it is so easy to go back to the wide path &name talks about , especially since i 'm just so lazy . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ it is so hard though , to trust &name . 
^ it is hard to see his plans working out , but i hope that i will be able to trust that &name has a brilliant plan for me ! 
^ the problem i suffer from is that i know it in my head , but rarely in my heart . 
^ that is , when i am on my own . 
^ when i am with lots of other christians or non-christians even , my faith is such a lot stronger . 
^ odd is n't it . 
^ i guess then it moves from being theory to real life . 
^ i do n't know , i 'm still trying to work through it all . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i certainly feel that my emotions are better when i 'm with lots of christians but i do n't trust emotion . 
^ i like the feeling of fellowship i get when i 'm in cu or a really enthusiastic meeting but they 're not lasting feelings . 
^ the real feelings of peace i 've had have only been when i 've been alone in my own head with &name and not really participating in any group worship . 
^ either that , or when people have been praying for me . 
^ actually , perhaps i do know what you mean . 
^ i find it easier to pray and try to follow &name when i know that there are other christians around who i could go and speak to . 
^ i do n't have to do it , but just know theyre there . 
^ but at home i feel really alone . 
^ so &name , i know what you mean . 
</text_normal>

^ i hope &name is good . 
^ sounds very exciting . 
^ i am thinking about doing a volcanology phd at the moment , but i do n't know really . 
^ we will see what happens , as i still do n't know if the place has been filled or not . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ found out that it has been filled . 
^ &name . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name . 
^ i 'm praying for you ! 
^ off to &name tomorrow , and i 'm so worried ! 
^ i 'm going to be on my own too . 
^ with no idea of waht to do ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ hey , you ca n't do that ! 
^ that 's my field ! 
^ i 've discovered that the volcano observatory in &name does volunteerships for a minimum of &num months which does n't get you any money ( and you have to pay your way food wise etc ) but may get you a project and definitely gets you cool work experience . 
^ also , they 're desperate for people with / doing actual degrees in geology to do digital mapping of recent lava flows - look them up on 
^ &website 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'll do that . 
^ &name ( graduated the year before you came to &name ) did a similar thing , if not the same thing . 
^ though i am also thinking about going to &name , and staying in &name too ... &name ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ both at the same time ? 
^ that 's some trick ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ the problem i 'm finding with reading the &name at the moment is that i 'm so overwhelmed with things to learn and remember and take in. &num feel so swamped that i 'll never understand and remember and put it all into use . 
</text_embedded>

^ some thoughts , and sorry if they are patronising - they ar n't meant to be ; try writing down what you are reading and thinking about , and do n't just put down stuff about your passage . 
^ write about what is going on in your life to , and what you are thinking , and how the bible relates to your situation , and if you believe it or not . 
^ be honest . 
^ write prayers down , make a priority to spend time with &name . 
^ then , every month or so look back at what types of things you have been feeling / thinking . 
^ i think , if you have n't done anything like this before , you will be surprised at how many times you repeat yourself , and how stupid you look in retrospect . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that 's a good idea . 
^ i have tried in the past but it usually only lasts a couple of days ! 
^ it will be good discipline for me to persevere . 
^ and it was n't patronising ! 
^ urgh. must pack bags . 
^ hope you have fun and find out what your going to do with your life , 
^ from &name 
^ &smiley
