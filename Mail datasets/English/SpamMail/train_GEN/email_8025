<text_embedded> 

^ i just got the impression that you were drunk when i read the email . 
^ i 'm not sure why now . 
^ i had been drinking myself at the time , although i was n't drunk . 
^ of course , knowing you as i do , i read this as " had een drinking myself at the time , and so i was completely , mind-gezlonckingly drunk " - which explains 
^ * everything * 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ &name ha . 
^ cheeky sod . 
^ &char * wasn't * that drunk . 
^ i 'd been to &name 's dinner with &name , and then had a couple of post dinner drinks at the castle with him . 
^ he was in serious need of cheering up , poor wez . 
^ so i just * had * to postpone the work i had to do for today ... oops ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name girl , you 'll get yourself into trouble if you keep carrying on like that . 
^ can &name fly ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ unfortunately , the splattered flies will not be integrated into my work since they are proving too hard to peel off the windscreen and the tree-huggers are complaining . 
^ we are using splattered undergrads as a practical and morally acceptable alternative . 
^ oh good . 
^ well as long as they sign permission slip type things , then i 'm sure it * is * morally acceptable . 
^ and i 'm sure if you offer them the price of a can of laget then they * will * sign such forms . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ what is this " laget " ? 
^ is it expensive ?

^ i did n't know you were n't one of those stupid people , did i ? 
^ hmph. 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ and if i could come to that would be nice &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ and you * didn't * think that was what i was thinking ? 
</text_embedded>

^ &char ) you do n't deserve to be earning a zillion pounds per sick day if you do n't take sick days when you can &char ) i 'm not entirely sure what you mean , but , yes , still too much detail 
</text_embedded>

^ &name &name thought it might have been enough to just say " &name has been off work sick but he 's back now " but i did n't think this until * after * i 'd typed out everything else , so i was n't going to delete it , was i ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ now look how much rubbish you 've written just because you acted first and thought later .

^ cheeky sod . 
^ well , if you * are * coming not this weekend but next , then he 'll more than likely be in &name anyway . 
</text_embedded>
