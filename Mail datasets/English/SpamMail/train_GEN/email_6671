^ hi , i 've looked the very promising screenshots of &name " work : &website 
^ very nice . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'd like to hear the reasoning on what the advantage is to the current dialog ; this one shows all the same functions , only on different &name . 
</text_embedded>

^ the major problem with the old &name dialog 's layout , &name , is that it mixes a set of radio buttons with a set of selections ( icon view , kfd via a push button , a combobox , or nothing in the case of " &name " . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name , i understand . 
^ and i agree this makes it loose its usability . 
^ your point to the modality of the dialog makes me realize a problem that i believe will only get worse with the proposed solution . 
^ the way &name are used in all applications is that they provide different views to the same data . 
^ one " ok " on the dialog means you ok all the changes on all the &name . 
^ the conclusion is that the proper place for the open / close buttons is to replicate them on each &name , so a different button is pressed for a different action . 
^ &name this is just a band-aid and does not really solve the problem . 
^ the problem of this dialog is that we want the user to select using a hierarchy of choices . 
^ the top level choices being the " file' /'recent " / template " &num . 
^ each top level choice leads to a very different path for the rest of the choices . 
^ the most obvious solution would be a wizard ; but i do n't see that as being an improvement &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ if one can get rid of the modality altogether , great ! 
^ then you can put everything in &num dialog ( assuming the required space exists ) and it all make sense . 
^ but if you ca n't get rid of the modality , then you should make it clear what that modality is . 
^ the radio buttons do n't accomplish this given the way the &name dialog works . 
^ &name widgets are n't inherently evil , but they need to be used where appropriate . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ this is not an appropriate place . 
</text_normal>

<text_embedded> 

^ a search button to be able to launch an embed &name would be great 
</text_embedded>

^ &name uses a document based approuch which means that file navigation is placed in konqueror and not in the application . 
</text_embedded>

^ hm ? 
^ then what is &name if it is n't file navigation ? 
^ every application that supports files provides file navigation via the open / save file dialogs ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ this is what every user expects ; but searching is not . 
^ no need to stretch the allready blurred line of how and where you navigate or create your documents . 
^ the user needs this distinction to protect him from doing damage in " the other side " . 
^ as this is searching ( allready blurred ) line might favor the idea ; and when advanced attributes and / or database searching is implemented i am all for this . 
^ but for now the concept seems wrong to me . 
^ its just &num step away from " why ca n't i delete my files using the kfd' -questions . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ to put a &name in the open dialog is not appropriate . 
^ &name 
</text_embedded>

^ it 's a large number of widgets , that 's certain . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name wrong with opening a new dialog with this ? 
^ if only because it will open in my last-opened size ... 
^ other small things might be that if i open a file from a remote server and then go to the create / open dialog again the 2nd &name will try to fetch a dir listing of that remote server again ... 
^ no need to do all that . 
^ the file _dialog_ is there for a reason . 
^ please stick to that . 
^ as to the real solution for a good dialog ; i do n't have a ready made answer . 
^ but i do know that it needs 
^ - a top-level choice to start walking down the different paths of selection 
^ - a way to see the last-selected-value when opening the dialog so i can just press " open " . 
^ - a second level selection for the different templates . 
^ so you can choose things like 'stationary " and " fax " from different folders as &char " &name " 
^ - feedback on the selected choice other then the too-small radiobutton 
^ &name ; the hyperbolic tree comes to mind here &smiley ) 
^ removing the " empty " and forcing the user to select a template seems like a good choice to me . 
^ then the fact that the " choose " and the " open " are both closing the dialog suggests they should be placed on the same level . 
^ i.e. next to each other . 
^ last ; the user might appreciate feedback on his selection ; page size and comments come to mind here . 
^ ( the tooltip idea &num mentioned before ) . 
^ &name , quick scetch attached that might not be the end-all , but should at the very least prove to solve more problems then most ideas i have seen so far . 
^ &name &name
