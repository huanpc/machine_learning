^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your assessment . 
^ however , i just have one quick suggestion . 
^ i recently heard from the &name of &name that although the college is not 
^ part of &name , they are still entitled to access to &name because it is 
^ regarded as an essential service by the university . 
^ can you pls find out whether this is in fact the case- maybe i can get in 
^ touch with the welfare office from &name . ... i know that we can afford 
^ it , but i guess that its just good to know . 
^ thanks much , &name

^ i 'm not sure if you got the following e-mail . 
^ please let me know what 
^ you think about it . 
^ yes , i had received it . 
^ the money they mention is per college , so if we 
^ were sharing the cost with the &name , that would work out at &pound; &num for us &char &char keep &name going . 
^ of course there 's no way of knowing how much benefit 
^ &name &name students , and grads in particular , actually get from &name , 
^ but it 's one of the prominent sources of confidential welfare support for 
^ students in &name . 
^ i think it would definitely be a shame if it had 
^ to close , so i 'd certainly recommend us trying to find the money . 
^ i 'm not sure exactly how you and &name allocated the budget for the travel and sports grants , but i know we underspent by quite a bit , so i 'd 
^ imagine it would be within our budget to contribute our share towards &name ... ? 
^ but i suppose it has to wait until the next committee meeting before we can actually agree to send any letter of endorsement . 
^ anyway , those are my thoughts on the matter . 
^ see you , 
^ &name
