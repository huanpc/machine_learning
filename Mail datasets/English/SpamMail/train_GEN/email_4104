^ okay , our summer holiday this year is going to be to &name . 
^ we will stay in a large house there . 
^ cost should be around &pound; &num each ( i hope but do n't know ) . 
^ date is provisionally the first week in august , but let me know if that does n't suit . 
^ i think i know that &name , &name , &name and i are keen to go . 
^ &name , &name and &name ca n't come . 
^ that leaves &name , &name , &name and &name . 
^ anyway , i need to know the following from everyone ( except &name , &name and &name - unless their positions have changed ) by thursday &name : 
^ &num - do you want to come ( yes / no ) 
^ &num - can you definitely come ( yes / no ) 
^ i would like to stress that it is not easy to organise a holiday for people who hardly give me any information and thereby appear to lack any interest in the whole affair . 
^ i realise you 're all busy , but i only need &num numbers and &num words . 
^ thank you . 
^ &name
