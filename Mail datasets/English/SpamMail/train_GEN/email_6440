<text_normal> 

^ august is just around the corner . 
^ for those not going away , we have once again booked &name &name to teach at a week-long &name &name school . 
^ this will run from august 19th to 23rd from &num to &num , on the theme " the tabernacle in the &name . " 
^ the tabernacle was the tent of &name devised by &name to provide a meeting place between himself and his people , &name . 
^ it was the cultural and religious centre for &name 's people spanning the several hundred years between their &name from &name and the construction of &name 's great &name in &name . 
^ &name will describe the tabernacle in great detail , providing fascinating insights into the activities of the priests and levites as they went about their duties and supervised the feasts and offerings . 
^ supremely , &name is prefigured in both its design and centents , and also in the many ceremonies that occured there . 
^ that 's what we have planned ; but to date we only have &num definitely booked to attend ! 
^ we would therefore be glad if folk could pass on the information to those who might be free during the day : that they might take this opportunity to have a fresh revelation of &name , which will establish , sustain and increase our faith . 
^ it 's &pound; &num per session registration fee , preferably in advance to &num the street , &name &name &name , &name &name . 
^ &name &name will accept phone bookings as time is running out , on &num &num . 
^ secondly , please pray for &name 's anointing to be on &name , as he teaches for &num hours every morning that week , and then every evening the following week at &name . 
^ ( details from &name & june &name &num . ) 
^ church &name : 
^ please pray this week for the leaders , work and witness of the following churches : &name baptist ( minister &name &name ) , &name christian fellowship .
