^ hi &name ! 
^ hey , great to hear from you , and your good news about graduating " first class " ! 
^ ( that anything like travelling first class ? ) no surprize really , considering what a fine chap you are ! 
^ yes , you 're hard to resist face-to-face . 
^ but then again ... so is everybody ! 
^ think about it &smiley 
^ anyways , since you 've asked , my movie script is currently being shipped out to most of the majors in &name , as well as to an inside ( very inside ) source , by which , &name willing , would land it directly into mr. &name 's hands . 
^ no kidding . 
^ but , sorry , a terrible lot of detail in this " happening " , and i 'm a slow typist so i 'll hold my tongue until this thing comes off . 
^ but that could be weeks , maybe even many months before we know anything at all . 
^ my producer friend down there says nothing happens fast in &name town ... so prayers accepted &smiley while i 'm waiting i 'm working on structuring yet another and very different screenplay . 
^ can you believe it ? ? ? 
^ simultaneous to all this , in between school presentations , i 've been up in the &name &name islands here carving with &name &name and gang quite a bit this spring . 
^ presently we 're creating the &num structure supporting interior house posts for the ceremonial big house he 'll be building a year or &num from now . 
^ the &num posts are matching sets of killer whales and &num . 
^ very cool . 
^ it 's been quite an experience carving so many objects on such a large scale ( the posts are 13ft high , cross beams 22ft , and roof beams 50ft ) exhausting , too , let me tell you ! 
^ &name is unbelievable . 
^ &num &num years old and he can work me into the ground . 
^ &name and i discontinued dating about a month ago . 
^ i say 'discontinued " because that 's what it amounted to . 
^ there was no " break up " with blaming , hurtfulness , etc. , just a mutual perception that we were pretty different kinds of people , and that , were we to marry , we would be " okay " but it would be a struggle to accomodate each other 's natures ... as we agreed , i 'm an explorer always looking to sail into the unknown to one find new thing after another , and she 's a gardener , prefering to stay put and repeat the same cycles of experience . 
^ anyways , we 're keeping in touch in a friendly manner : ) 
^ do n't worry about the future &name ( i know , that 's hard for a young man in your present condition ! ) you 'll know soon enough to what and where &name will lead you . 
^ in the meantime i hope you can enjoy the pleasures of the present moment , with &name , with your new fancy paints &smiley guess i 'll go do the same here ... 
^ till our next , 
^ &name 
^ &char / &char what does " blagged " mean ?
