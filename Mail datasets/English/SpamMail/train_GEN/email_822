^ hi &name , 
^ &name , i 've been playing football tonight . 
^ i think i will be out tomorrow night too ( raving party animal ) . 
^ i might be able to chat on wednesday eve . 
^ and i must do some more work this week ! 
^ have you done anything exciting today &name ? 
^ i am going to buy a guitar with my friend &name tomorrow - for him that is ! 
^ my lap-top should be very good thankyou . 
^ see you soon , 
^ &name 
^ &name ! 
^ &name , good afternoon , this e-mail is from &name . 
^ thank you for your e-mail , i had a wonderful holiday on the &name isle . 
^ i 'm glad to hear you have been working . 
^ i 'm also pleased to receive , at long last , news that &name is still alive . 
^ thank you . 
^ " &name is a bit better after i gave her a good clean-out and made sure all her components were in order . " 
^ - i 'm so happy for you both . 
^ " guess what , i 'm buying a lap-top ! ! ! ! ! ! " 
^ - i 'm shocked . 
^ is it any good ? 
^ i look forward to meeting " &name " , what is his hard drive called ? 
^ i 'll be very sorry not to see &name 
^ - i was counting on her presence this term to ensure we had a lovely time in the flat . 
^ " &name , the other day i overdrew my bank account for the first time . 
^ now i have got an overdraft , just like all the other students ! " 
^ - oh yes , it 's a well-known fact that absolutely all ( without any exceptions ) students have an overdraft . 
^ welcome to the multinational , multilingual crowd that comprises the rest of the entire world student population . 
^ incidentally , when you overdraw your bank , that means you are overdrawn - you do n't automatically have an overdraft . 
^ they charge you lots of money for being overdrawn without an overdraft . 
^ well , today i had a lazy morning as i was tired from &num hours travelling yesterday - we did n't get home until &name last night . 
^ i then did a small amount of studying this afternoon , followed my moving some money through my various accounts ( always guaranteed to lift the corners of my mouth into a smile ) . 
^ i am shortly going outside ( it 's very windy weather , but otherwise pleasant ) to build a step up to our house . 
^ i will be using cement for the first time in my life ! 
^ are you well ? 
^ when is &name due to enter medlockworld ? 
^ yes , i 'd love to chat online . 
^ does tonight suit you ? 
^ if so , then what about 7pm ? 
^ if not , let me know when ? 
^ until sometime in the near future 
^ &name
