^ &name love &name x 
^ &num &name ( &name or mr. ) ( &name and prejudice ; &name ) 
^ * because he 's the ultimate . 
^ i fell in love with him when i read the book when i was &num , and then all over again when he looks at &name just so so so intensely . 
^ and then he 's basically the modern version on &name , and it 's just the way he looks at her . 
^ &num &name &name ( from the " &name " books by &name &name ) 
^ * there 's a big chance you wo n't have read these books because they are n't &char . 
^ well known , but they are book i would love to have written . 
^ they are so beautiful and poetic , and the heroine is an author ... and &name is beautiful . 
^ &num &name &name ( the &name &name ) 
^ * he does everything for &name , and yet still she ultimately rejects him ... it 's so tragic and such wonderful prose . 
^ &num &name ( much ado about nothing ) 
^ * i think because i am very like &name , and would like to find my own &name &num day ; someone quite like me ! 
^ ( and because my &name 's name was &name , so i feel i have some connection ) . 
^ &num &name &name ( the &name &name affair ) 
^ * it 's the money and the pinstripe suits ( mmm , men in suits ) ; o my word , he 's eminently fanciable . 
^ he has everything except me ! 
^ &num &name ( &name &name &name ) 
^ * he 's had so much practice ; and he 's so considerate and caring about what his women want . 
^ &num captain &name &name ( the sound of music ) 
^ * again , it 's the way he looks at &name when he realises he 's in love with her . 
^ he 's fine ! 
^ ( but maybe without the children ) . 
^ &num &name &name ( &name &name ) ( yes , i do know that he was &name ) 
^ * i think because he epitomises the decadence of the pre-war period that i 'm in love with . 
^ i would love to have lived in that way in those decades ; so carefree and spirited and hazy , doing what you wanted all day , all those english traditions and repressed emotions , those magnificent low-waisted dresses and cloche hats . 
^ the threat of war looming near , yet the first world war seems almost romantic in a way , with men dying poetically on the mist-filled battlefields ... i wish i had lived then . 
^ &num &name &name ( the &name &name ) 
^ * now this is the soppy of all soppy books ! 
^ but i read it when i was &num and i love it still . 
^ the period ( georgian ) appeals to me too . 
^ &num &name or &name ... ca n't quite decide which ( i capture the &name ) 
^ * but only really because i want to be &name &name , the narrator , because she knows what it is to be in unrequited love , and the last few paragraphs of the book are so hopeless , yet so hoping and beautiful . 
^ ( &num . 
^ &name &name 's cop in la &name ) 
^ * &name !
