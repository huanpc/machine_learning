^ hi everyone , 
^ i hope you have all had a good &name break and are already looking forward to whatever you have planned for the summer ( let 's forget about what comes in between now and then ! ) . 
^ just to let you know , i 'll be leading the cross-cultural mission group this year , so would love to say a big thank you to &name for all her work over the past couple of terms ! 
^ hopefully we can have our first meeting of the term next week - will send out details of that soon - but first ... 
^ if you are still interested in some sort of cross-cultural mission in the future , could you email me back and briefly tell me how the &name can support you now . 
^ maybe things like bible studies , workshops , prayer sessions , talks on specifics etc. could be good ? 
^ many of you have shown interest in working with muslims , so i was thinking of concentrating on that this term . 
^ would many of you make use of a talk on effective evangelism to muslims and maybe a culturally sensitive &name &name garden party for muslim friends ? 
^ i 'd love to hear your ideas , 
^ yours ,
