^ &website . 
^ you might have noticed that there was no penguin &org last week . 
^ that 's because &name was in transition from &num newsletter editor to another . 
^ &name &name has moved on to other projects , and you 're now stuck with &name &name as the new penguin &org maven . 
^ can i stop talking about myself in third person now ? 
^ &name . 
^ penguin &org will come out once a week , hopefully chock full of tips and tricks and information that helps you take one more step toward being the &name guru you always wanted to be . 
^ if you have nagging problems or favorite things you 'd like to see covered , drop me a line at &email . 
^ i may not have a chance to respond personally to you right away , especially during the busy summer season , but you just might see your problem solved here in these pages . 
^ rather than yammering on , let 's get right down to business ! 
^ see you at &name , &name &name 
^ gnometweak 
^ in this week 's &num , i talk about environment and shell variables . 
^ what if you want to have a new variable created and set every time you log into your account ? 
^ you 'd edit either the file ~ /.bash_profile , or ~ /.profile , depending on which your &name distribution uses . 
^ your starting file might look something like : 
^ # .bash_profile # get the aliases and functions if [ &char ~ /.bashrc ] ; then . 
^ ~ /.bashrc fi # user specific environment and startup programs path $ path: $ home / bin export path unset username 
^ in this case , i would start adding new variables directly beneath the line starting with path , just for the sake of keeping things nicely organized . 
^ i 'll take the same example i use in the gnomecore section , where i created the environment variable &name . 
^ i could make sure &name was always set after i logged in by editing the file so that it looks like the following : 
^ # .bash_profile # get the aliases and functions if [ &char ~ /.bashrc ] ; then . 
^ ~ /.bashrc fi # user specific environment and startup programs path $ path: $ home / bin myname' &name &name &name " export path &name unset username 
^ notice the &num changes here . 
^ i added the variable definition beneath path , and then i added the variable to the end of the export line - with a single space between the entries . 
^ this change wo n't take effect until i either log out and back into this account , or i type : 
^ source ~ /.bash_profile 
^ if your file is ~ /.profile , you 'd type : 
^ source ~ /.profile

^ is all this &name stuff overwhelming ? 
^ ease into &name with an &name from an expert . 
^ &name &name , author of numerous books on &name , lends his digital pen to this tutorial , giving you information on how to become functional with the command line interface and explore several &name applications and capabilities . 
^ by the time you 've covered all the material , you 'll know how to process files , script some processes and get at-a-glance information on your system 's performance . 
^ learn the basics of editing config files with command line text editors and much more . 
^ get into &name today ! 
^ &name and &name variables 
^ ever try to install a piece of software and it starts complaining that you need to create a shell or environment variable before you can proceed ? 
^ both types of variables are held during your login session , containing information that your system uses in order to know important things about itself . 
^ the main difference between the &num is that an environment variable is considered universal , and is carried from login to login and shell to shell , if you 've set it up properly in your login files . 
^ a shell variable is only used in a single shell , or login instance . 
^ visually , there 's a big difference . 
^ all environment variables are traditionally typed in &name , while shell variables are usually lowercase . 
^ to see all of your currently set environment variables , type : 
^ env | more 
^ you probably have over a screen 's worth of environment variables . 
^ piping this information through more ensures that you 'll see it a screen at a time . 
^ to see all of your variables , both environment and shell , type : 
^ set | more 
^ to see only &num of these variables " contents , type : 
^ echo $ variable 
^ for example , to see where your home directory is ( a universally used environment variable ; do n't change this ) , type : 
^ echo $ home 
^ you can change either type of variable 's settings ( or even create a new &num ) at any time from the command line . 
^ just be careful of what you change . 
^ many of the environment variables are vital for half your software to work properly ! 
^ start by making up your own until you 're familiar with the process of working with these . 
^ for example , you could type : 
^ myname' &name &name &name " echo $ &name &name echo $ myage 
^ give it a try , and see what happens !

^ do you want to try out &name without having to install something onto your hard drive ? 
^ want to let a friend try it without having to hold their hand while they try to get the operating system working on their system ? 
^ try &name . 
^ this is a &name distribution that you can run directly off the &name itself . 
^ not only is this a great teaching tool , but if you 're borrowing a pc from someone else , you can use &name instead of having to use their windows setup !
