^ &name , 
^ are you sure you are using ssh1 ? 
^ if you are using &name , you must indicate you wish to use version &num of the protocol since the key you have is an ssh1 key . 
^ you can do this with the command : 
^ ssh &num ( machine name ) 
^ tell me if it works . 
^ if this does n't apply , please tell me what the problem appears to be . 
^ - &name
