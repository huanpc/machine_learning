^ what i am saying is that if the user wants an attribute decribing the original source of the data , they would add the attribute using a map box because the user who is constructing the system is likely to know where the data is coming from . 
^ so for instance if each soldier is coming to the system separately ( different input ports ) , then the user could add a map box right next to the original input port that adds an attribute string : 'soldier &char " . 
^ if they are all coming together in &num big input port , then they would all get the same stream id anyway , so the map could add the attribute 'soldier data " . 
^ is that right ? 
^ do stream id 's get assigned per input port to the system , or are they assigned earlier , before they get to &name ?

^ in our current proposal , stream ids can get changed depending on what boxes they go through . 
^ so stream id does n't always give information a bout the original source of the data . 
^ so at what point do we need to distinguish input streams ? 
^ if the user needs to know where the data originally came from , they would add their own attribute using a map box because the user would never know that the system was using a stream id . 
^ what does this map box use to figure this out ?
