^ so far , i played with the &name , i am going to implement the real stuff soon . 
^ a snapshot of what the dialog will look like is at 
^ &website 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ does " remove scheme ... " really bring up another dialog ? 
^ why ? 
^ if it does n't, the ellipsis is wrong . 
^ there is no visual association with the scheme selector and the actual items contained within the scheme ( which i assume are the fonts above . 
^ for example , there 's no way to work out if the anti-aliasing settings are in the scheme or not ( i guess not , but the user should not have to guess , they shoould be given visual hints ) . 
^ what is the use case for " import scheme " ? 
^ will drag and drop work ? 
^ why does save scheme exist at all ? 
^ you already have a " &name " button . 
^ the scheme should be saved on clicking ok , and changes abandoned on &name . 
^ how does a user create a * new * scheme ? 
^ i 'm not sure the repetition of 'scheme " in the scheme group box is a good idea . 
^ the visual context should disambiguate ... 
^ &num possibility would be : 
^ |--font scheme------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | | my scheme | / | | ----------------- | general : | . . ... | .

^ | help | ... 
^ regards &name 
^ p.s. what does the mnemonic for &name actually do ? 
^ it seems a bit odd for a group box .
