^ -  ame 's  ame  ame , no.  um ^ well ! ^ that e-mail was fantastic ! ! ! ^ i really enjoyed reading it ! ^ i laughed myself to sleep last night ! ^  ame , but a totally different style of writing than usual ? ^ the words were a lot longer , averaging  um letters per word rather than the usual  um and  um . ^ ( mine 's  um  ame ! ) also , do n't think i 'm forgetting that you wrote  um , congratulations ! ^ you must have been in an eloquent mood . ^ it was also really funny , with some of the phrases sounding like they came straight out of  ame ^ i now have the required technology to do it captain  ame  ame ^ some of the phrases , of course , did not sound like they came straight out of  ame ^ in " the  ame " ^ i guess that 's said best with an irish accent ? ^ yes , there have been developments in the where is  ame situation . ^ ( see email titled  ame sighted in tree ) i am going to attempt to capture possible candidates for the renegade  um on film . ^ i was wondering since your scanner and programme seems really good , ( not to mention cool you 've said that more than once now ! ) would it be possible for you to alter a photo of a dumb-looking raven and , say , give it facial expression ? ^ if so , then the possibilities are limitless ! ^ the tales of  ame could take on a totally new dimension ! ^ ( no pun intended ) if that would be possible , then i 'll take some photos , develop them and e-mail you them at some point . ^ probably not until the week after next as i 'll be away on this  ame camp , which , incidentally , is not with  ame . ^ (  ame ! ^ you deduced incorrectly there ! ^ do n't jump to conclusions grammatical princess . ) ^ by the way , if you do set up a web-site , then please give me the address . ^ no questions asked . ^ with regards to the water guns issue , no , i have n't been soaked yet . ^ however , i doubt that 's because my i 'm unsoakable air has followed me home . ^ i quite simply have n't taken part in any attacks yet . ^ my brother comes in dripping every night though . ^ so pigeons ! ^ (  ame i hate them ! ^  ame  ame ,  ame ! ) i love that  ame  ame ,  ame ! ^ line it fills my heart with mirth and merriment , laughter overflowing through my veins . ^ actually ,  ame hates pigeons too . ^ however , his eyes burn with laser-like beams which harry them as they fly , sizzling their feathers and dismembering their spleens . ^ (  ame  ame  ame ,  ame no.  um ) i bet you wish you had laser-like beams in your eyes . ^ although , i do n't think you 'd be too safe to be around some of the time ^ i like the following quote from your last e-mail ; it is nice to physically damage the wretched birds well , well , well ! ^  ame the pigeon slayer ! ^ who would have thought it ? ^ also ; pigeons are from another dimension and sent here to bemuse and confound us lowly and ignorant human beings  ame , well , i think i prefer  ame the pigeon slayer to  ame the insane stellar physicist . ^ am i guessing right that they are sent by  ame ? ^ i hope not . ^ devious raven . ^ this wedding has made me determine that mine will be a nice simple affair . ^ well , grammatical princess , have you abdicated ? ^ what you just wrote was that you determine (  har ) that your wedding will be a nice simple affair . ^ in other words , you found out that etc. i.e. somehow you have found out what was going to happen in the future . ^  ame dodgy . ^ if i can trick anyone into marrying me the most masterfully and skillfully planned  ame trick of the century . ^  ame and deception will know no limits . ^ (  ame joking , i 'm sure you 'll manage somehow . ) ^ i have spent a lot of time recently wondering about traditions . ^ i 've spent the last year wondering about them , specifically  ame 's. ^ why do we have to have cakes piled on top of each other ? ^  ame ! ^ so the one at the top does n't fall down , of course ! ^ i would have thought that was obvious ! ^ who ever heard of floating cakes ? ! ^ you are turning into a southerner showing signs of being a normal human being ! ^ do n't insult me ,  har epitomy of normality . ^ kidding . ^ thank you for what i take as a compliment . ^ well , i have waffled now for far too long i most sincerely disagree . ^ one can never have enough waffles . ^ now , in an e-mail dated 30th june , you said the following ^ if any of you happen to be up here at all during the summer , let me know and i can meet up with you . ^ well , i shall hold you to your word . ^ i intend to go down to  ame for the day sometime during the week beginning 24th july to have a look at my flat , get some textbooks , check e-mail , hunt for  ame , etc. do you think there 's any chance you will be down around the same time ? ^ let me know . ^  ame [ sometimes i wonder just how brilliant  um man can be ]in ^ my egotism is fake , just in case you thought i really believed that . ^  ame ,  ame , shine ! ^ fill this land with the father 's glory . ^  ame ,  ame ,  ame ! ^ set our hearts on fire . ^  ame , river , flow ! ^  ame the nations with grace and mercy . ^ send forth your word ,  ame , and let there be light ! ^  ame thanks for double spacing , but i only received single spaces , it must be the e-mail programs ! ^ oh well , see you , have fun . ^ by the way , have you told any of your family about  ame ? ^ ( except from your sister  ame ) </text_normal></message_body></message>
