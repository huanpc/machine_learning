^ i 'd be very happy to see &name in &name - i 'm glad to hear he 'll be working with you . 
^ could you use this email address please and not the &name one ? 
^ so &num rooms arriving &name 24th leaving &name 28th , &num room arriving 24th leaving 27th ? 
^ there 's a couple of options - there 's a b+b very close to my house ( the &name &name house ) which i expect will have rooms - i 've put people up there before and had good reports - it 's reasonably priced for &name ( maybe &num pounds per room per night , not all rooms have ensuite bathrooms ) . 
^ if you stay there , i can conveniently drive everyone to and from the &org but my house is at least &num mins walk from the centre of &name ( bus service is conveniently located , but not very frequent - in fact if there are &num of you , taking a taxi is almost as cheap as taking a bus ) . 
^ alternatively , you can stay closer to the centre , but getting to the lab will be more awkward - it used to be in the centre of town but now it has moved a little way out - there 's a couple of &name that are reasonably central on the right side of town , but i will have to check for recommendations . 
^ there 's a guest house right by the station ( &num steps ) that i 've used for visitors in the past , but it 's fairly expensive . 
^ if you look at 
^ &website 
^ the lab is close to where it says school of veterinary science ( b5 ) , my house is on &name &name road ( e7 ) 
^ &name , i should 've asked this before , do you want to give a talk to the natural language group as a whole while you 're here ? 
^ you do n't need to feel obliged in any way - if you do want to do it , i should explain that there 's nobody much doing formal semantics currently so it 'd have to be pitched at a relatively non-technical level . 
^ best ,
