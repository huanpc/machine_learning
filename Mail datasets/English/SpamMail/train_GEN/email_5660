^ hello ! 
^ once again i 'm emailing you with a list as long as your arm of shows wanting people to fill every position in the book at a whole range of venues ... and this time an impassioned plea for help next week . 
^ also , do n't forget that applications for crew for the &name &name &name &name , &name , close tomorrow . 
^ the last advert omitted dates for the show which falls in weeks &num and &num next term ( ie the last week of term and the week following ) . 
^ it 's a really exciting project and there 's something for everyone to do ! 
^ contact &name to apply . 
^ the duchess of &name ( week &num mainshow ) is looking to fill the following posts : 
^ set designer costume designer musical director press officer choreographer- the duchess of &name aims to use a variety of styles of physical , non-naturalistic theatre , in order to approximate a truer sense of how &name saw " theatre " . 
^ you will be working with the director from an early stage , working through the text , discussing blocking and scene-setting , and the manipulation of up to &num people on a stage . 
^ you wil need to help get the actors working within non-english traditions of physical theatre such as commedia del' arte and 'danse macabre " . 
^ knowledge of either are not prerequisites for application : knowledge of commedia del' arte would be a useful bonus . 
^ examples of scenes you would help to choreograph and stylise include raucous masquerade parties and a fevered dreamscape populated by " lunatics " . 
^ contact &name or &email for details or to apply . 
^ application deadline : midnight on the 4th december - but the sooner the better ... 
^ * * &char voyage round my father * * by &name &name 
^ week &num &name mainshow 
^ requires crew : 
^ sm / &name &name &name set designer sound props costume make-up publicists 
^ a voyage round my father is about a son 's relationship with his father , who he respects intensely and whose opinions have a profound effect on all he does . 
^ as a child he is unable to see his father 's faults , but as he grows , the audience come to see the father as a complex and , in many ways , flawed character . 
^ the &name knows this , but it does not reduce the respect he feels . 
^ we see the father in a domestic environment , where his unmentioned blindness and obsession with his garden distance him from both the &name , and the mother , who plays an essential intermediary role . 
^ while we gain &num view of him from this , we also see him in his happiest environment , that of the law court , where he is in his element ; we are provided with this scene at the very end of act &num , where we could almost be thinking that the father 's power over his &name is waning . 
^ act &num sees that &name in a environment away from home , in work and marriage , still affected by his father , but gradually becoming like him : this is conveyed to us through the relationship the father and &name have with the &name 's wife &name . 
^ the father , at times , seems to have a more honest relationship with &name than his &name : he overshadows his son even here . 
^ the &name 's professional life takes a second place to the decline of the father , who , although more irrational and obtuse than ever , dominates even more . 
^ the garden falls into disrepair and the father is not far behind . 
^ he dies , leaving the &name alone . 
^ to apply ; or for more information , please contact &name on &email . 
^ * * * lovely lovely lighting person to be bribed with chocolate and flowers wanted to cover &num night of the impromime , on &name 4th at the &name * * * 
^ i know it 's a bit late notice but is there any lovely person who would lovelyly cover for me for just &num night of the impromime , " &name i 'm supposed to be directing and being an evil mirror in my college 's panto , and it clashes with the opening night of the 4th .. it 's not a big time commitment but if someone could cover for me they 'd have to come to a few rehearsals to get the idea of what 's going on , as the actual show is totally improvised , but the rehearsals are so so much fun to watch , not in the slightest bit tedious " &name they 're all different and the best way for anyone in the entire universe to spend their afternoon , except maybe for a beaver with a limp whose dam is about to break and whose wife is giving birth and whose goldfish need feeding .. basically it 'll be loads of fun , not a massive commitment , so if you 're interested email me , &name on &email and let me know .. i need to know quite quick so i can tell the panto people whether they need to find a new director and evil magic mirror , and do n't forget my lovely bribe for the lovely person ... !
