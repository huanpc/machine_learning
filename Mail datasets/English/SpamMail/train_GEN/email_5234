^ suppose a strong young player qualifies for the &name . 
^ should the &name say to them " if you accept the trip , you are also accepting a commitment to showing around &name &name visitors to the &name " ? 
^ i do n't think it should .

^ not an entirely hypothetical situation . 
^ i have explained myself in greater detail in a private email to &name . 
^ i do n't think anyone would expect this to be contractual .
