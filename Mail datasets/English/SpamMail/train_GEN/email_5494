^ hi , 
^ i hope you all enjoyed the squash this afternoon . 
^ after a bit of consultation with prospective beginners at the squash , we 've decided to shift the beginners " session times slightly , so that people with afternoon lectures can still make a session . 
^ the &num different beginners " sessions will now go from 3-4pm and 4-5pm on fridays . 
^ the course will be taught from scratch , for absolute beginners , but feel free to attend them if you have a little experience but want to brush up a little before going to the intermediate session ( 4-6pm on sunday ) . 
^ all equipment is provided - all you need to do is turn up wearing trainers , tracksuit trousers and a &char shirt . 
^ best wishes , 
^ &name &name 
^ &name depending on demand there may also be a more informal beginners " session on sunday afternoons ( either 4-5pm or 5-6pm ) , but this will not be run by our professional coach . 
^ &name if you want to be taken off the fencing mailing list please e-mail &email .
