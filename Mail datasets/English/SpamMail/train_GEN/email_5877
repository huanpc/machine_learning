^ i 'll remind everyone that they should have understood &name , checked out the current src and &name modules and have your own stuff added to the repository by now . 
^ sunday is too late to be fiddling with this stuff . 
^ note that the docs have to be handed by &num noon on tuesday , and thus we need to have them finished by monday . 
^ that means we are on day &num out of &num . 
^ the spec document must be &num words long . 
^ we have &num words in the requirements document ( &name is working on the latex version of this , and he will have them done by saturday morning ) 
^ thus we need another &num words . 
^ &name , &name , &name , &name & &name are down to get the specs done . 
^ &name , &name and i stayed until &num on thursday designing stuff . 
^ as a result of this i am writing the module definitions for the distribution system and &name is / has written the module design for the factorisation system . 
^ somewhere we need to articulate &name 's work on these algorithms . 
^ this could be javadocs or in latex . 
^ i suggest that everyone should meet at the &name at &num on saturday . 
^ we can have at least &num groups of us , one on the spec . 
^ &name and one on the module interfaces . 
^ the aim to get those &num words typed in , and to finish the module interfaces . 
^ i got this from deliverables.html : the deliverables expected for each of the &num review meetings ... 
^ functional specification and module design 
^ * introduction - informal description of project 
^ * assumptions - to clarify specification 
^ * environment - choice of language and tools 
^ * inputs , functions & outputs 
^ * overall architecture 
^ * specification of components and their test requirements 
^ * &name acceptance criteria 
^ * division of tasks - including manager , librarian , secretary , documentation as well as design , coding , troubleshooting and arrangements for covering each other 
^ we also need a project plan - who is doing this ? 
^ what kind of user interface are we aiming for ? 
^ please could everyone re-read the deliverables and check we have n't missed anything - it is better to worry now than to miss an important part out . 
^ &name 
^ " nothing would please me more than being able to hire &num programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software . " - &name &name &num
