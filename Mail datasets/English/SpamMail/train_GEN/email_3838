^ my dear and distant friends , scattered amongst the nether-reaches of this fair and fabled land , greetings . 
^ as it stands ( people-wise ) right now , for the grand get-together on the weekend of the 14-16th at my place . ... 
^ me ( possibly - ( joke ) ) &name &name ( yes ) &name ( yes ) &name ( yes ) &name ( hopefully yes ) &name ( arriving on sat night - yes ) &name ( due to some brilliant negotiating - yes ) &name ( hopefully yes ) &name ( yes ) &name ( yes ) &name ( no responce as yet - can someone give me his number please ? ) &name ( unfortunatly -no ) and tonight &name suggested inviting &name too , so hopefully he might be able to come as well . 
^ ( please someone forward this on to him ! 
^ -thanks ) 
^ tell me if i 've got any of these wrong ... 
^ what i need from you is : approximate date and time of arrival 
^ and when you come bring with you - sleeping bags pillow water bottle . 
^ ( i 've got lots of mattresses , so no need to bring them ) 
^ and with regards to food ... as &name said , it would be helpful if you brought something . 
^ the way i think it is best to work this out is as follows . 
^ watch me delegate . 
^ &num ) i 'm out from &num : &num on friday night , ( my parents " 25th ) but &name will be here ( is that possible , &name ? ) . 
^ he can be me . 
^ so , if &name can be in charge of supper for those of you who will be here on that night , that would be very helpful . 
^ &name , there is a very good fish + &name shop nearby , which means you could order that if you want . 
^ &num ) saturday breakfast - i 'll handle this , cooking a feast of french toast and &name , etc 
^ &num ) saturday lunch - perhaps &num people could handle this - &name + &name . 
^ if you could get stuff to make ( perhaps a picnic ) lunch for the people who will be here . 
^ if it is picnic , then that gives us flexiblilty . 
^ &num ) saturday night - you will be treated to a &name ( which i 'll deal with ) could &num people bring things to make a salad with ( &name + &name ) and could &num people bring a desert ( &name + &name ( &name - i know you are coming from &name , so if you ca n't do this - worry not ! ) ) 
^ &num ) sunday breakfast - cereal + toast or something simple like that ( i 'll handle it ) 
^ &num ) sunday lunch - &name + garlic bread . 
^ ( i 'll do this ) could &num people bring deserts there ? 
^ &name + &name . 
^ &name , &name , and &name , if you can come ... ( and read this e-mail ) either bring some munchables ( anyone else is welcome to do this too ! ) 
^ and if anyone is coming in a car and wants to bring some liquids ( juices for bfast + coke etc ) with them ( &name ) that would be great . 
^ do n't bring drinks if you are on the train - too heavy i 'm sure ! 
^ tell me if this is a problem . 
^ so , your responce to this e-mail will be prompt ( click now on reply ) saying if this sound ok or not to you , and then we can work out any details or hick ups which may arise ...
