^ &name told me i had to email you and &name to let you know which files to save before reinstalling windows on her computer . 
^ i ca n't remember what exactly i have on there , &name i was going to sort it all out after i get home . 
^ but basically i want all the documents saved ( supervision work , attachments , text files , &name files etc. . ) and definitely anything with the name &name in it , as that 's my group project from last year which i want to save . 
^ i think any of the applications there are can be replaced , so do n't bother saving them . 
^ oh , but keep my mp3s as well please ... &smiley
