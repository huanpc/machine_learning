^ the most recent &name &name definition file ( dated &num / &num ) identifies all files created by &name as containing the &website . 
^ in short , what 's up with that ?

^ in short , and i hope you do n't mind the brief reply since i 'm writing rather a lot of these e-mails at the moment , &name have managed to detect &name &name files incorrectly as containing this virus when they do not ( false-positives ) . 
^ &name have been contacted and i 'm waiting to hear from them . 
^ some people have reported that updating to the &num / &num definitions resolves the problem and so you could try that , although it does not fix it on my system ( &name &num ) . 
^ yours , 
^ &name &name &name &name author 
^ &name &name : powerful , free & easy for file sharing &website
