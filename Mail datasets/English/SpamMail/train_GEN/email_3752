^ hi &name , 
^ yes - that letter sounds very good . 
^ it is worth a try , someone out there may well " bite " ! 
^ as regards the 2nd paragraph , it is fine to put what you have for the purposes of the letter . 
^ you can take it that you have been offered the project subject to obtaining full funding from an external source . 
^ best wishes , &name

^ hi &name ! 
^ i hope you 've had a good &name . 
^ i 'm about ready now to take the next st ep and send out the letters etc , asking for sponsorship for the phd . 
^ i would appreciate a quick reply , so that i can send this off . 
^ i have attached the letter below , so you might see it . 
^ what do you think 
^ &num other thing , although in your office you said as much , i have never formally been offered this project , even on the condition of my getting fu nding . 
^ i do n't know if this is necessary , but for the second paragraph of my letter , it might be appropriate . 
^ i 've managed to get about &num mining companies addresses and e-mail addre sses . 
^ i was going to send it by e-mail , to save time and money . 
^ that is n't a problem is it ? 
^ i have also thought about sending it to &name , just in the off-chanc &char , and i 'll send it to the oil companies too . 
^ hopefully one of them will realise the potential of this project ! 
^ thanks &name !

^ dear sir / madam , 
^ my name is &name &name , and i am currently in my 3rd and final year of an undergraduate geology degree at &name university . 
^ i hope to contin ue my studies in geology over the coming years . 
^ ideally , i would like to &char pecialise in three-dimensional digital mapping of geological structures . 
^ this field is undergoing rapid development , as advances in the computer in dustry make it more feasible and informative . 
^ &name university has accepted my application to continue my study in th is area at the phd level . 
^ they propose a three-year doctorate during which i would develop a three-dimensional emplacement model of the whin sill . 
^ &char owever , due to cutbacks at the british geological survey , the funds which until recently would have paid for this study are no longer available . 
^ the cost of this computer-intensive research is high ( approximately &pound; &num &num , &num per annum ) . 
^ under the advice of one of my potential supervisors , dr. &name &name , i am seeking sponsorship for this postgraduate degree . 
^ as a company with a vested interest in the computing / geological / mapping / minin &char field , i felt it appropriate to approach you about sponsorship for this pr oject . 
^ it is my hope that you will consider helping me to fund this study , either in part or in full . 
^ i attach a short synopsis of the proposed phd , prepared by &name &name &char , &name and &name of &name university , and an approximate breakdow &char of costs . 
^ i also attach my re9sume9 . 
^ thank you for considering this ap plication and i eagerly await your reply .

^ the intrusion architecture of the whin sill complex : digital acquisition and modelling 
^ digital mapping technologies provide the potential to automatically capt ure , visualize and model the &num geometry of structures such as basins , in trusions , and fault zones . 
^ new methodologies that best combine &name , &name &name , &name data management systems and visualisation software are now urgently required . 
^ in conjunction with the &name ( &name &name &name ing ) and &name ( system for integrated geospatial mapping ) projects at &name , the aim of this project will be to develop methodologies of collecting sp atially constrained geological information in the field and producing &num models from the data . 
^ this provides the opportunity to test a range of new technologies on a specific geological problem , including data collection , data processing , &num geological model construction and data management . 
^ the student will use &name , &name and &name &name location methods to ma &char intrusions of the whin sill complex , to cm-scale accuracy , collating &name tial co-ordinates on a palm-top computer whilst traversing along or across the exposed igneous bodies . 
^ the data will be incorporated onto a digital &num &char topographic map and aerial photograph database using industry standard &char &name for data management in a &name format . 
^ structural attributes observ &name at individual localities will be collected and stored in digital format , including contact type and orientation data , linkage features displayed ,

^ factors determining the final emplacement of high-level dykes , sills and laccoliths are complex , and depend upon a range of physical parameters in cluding magma driving pressure , the local ( and regional ) stress field , and the physical properties ( viscosity and density ) of the intruding magma . 
^ despite their wide occurrence and structural importance in basin architect ure , their &num geometry is not well understood . 
^ the development of a digit &name model will allow the reconstruction of the emplacement history through time as well as an assessment of the effects of intrusion of a major sill complex on basin evolution and architecture . 
^ the student will be part of the &num modelling group at &name . 
^ this incl udes the &name research group ( &name , &name ) , a well-estab lished group of &name and post-doctoral researchers studying the geological and rheological aspects 
^ of faults and shear zones , and the magmatic modelling group ( &name ) , co ncerned with the influence of igneous rocks on sedimentary basins . 
^ they wi ll receive training in state of the art digital mapping and data managemen &char techniques together with field-based mapping . 
^ this training will be relevant to a broad range of future careers in the earth sciences . 
^ related ongoing &name projects include : &num ) &name link project on quantif ying fault zone evolution and basement reactivation ; &num ) &name - an &name 5th framework initiative on sub-basalt imaging .
