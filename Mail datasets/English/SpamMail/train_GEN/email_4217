^ i assume that it is better for you to go with the others on the third . 
^ before &num may be a problem so i will try for arrival in &name on 2nd i think since you will need to stay somewhere else on the west coast in order to get to &name before &num . 
^ i think you would want to buy the guitar in the &name , if it is sensible . 
^ also , i am assuming you are staying in &name til about the 19th or 20th july even though &name is not there . 
^ &name &name is staying with us this weekend so you might be able to arrange something through him .

^ dad , 
^ re flight to get in to sf 
^ i could arive early ie , before 8am on the third , instead of the second . 
^ what do you think of that ? 
^ the ladies are staying in the airport hotel because they are driving the next day , but i ca n't drive so there is little need for me to arrive that day . 
^ are there any flights that arrive at that time ? 
^ re luggage- i was thinking of getting a guitar , so that i could master that in the evenings , and it would be fun too , and useful for quiet times etc. &name idea ?

^ &name , 
^ i have not heard from &name . 
^ shall i book canadian affair flight to &name for june 2nd and then &name to &name and &name &name flights . 
^ i have not yet sorted out the best way to get &name to &name but that should be straightforward ( famous last words ) . 
^ &num point to note is that luggage limits on canadian affair flights is small . 
^ &num hockey bag is probably what you get .
