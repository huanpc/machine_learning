^ no , &name has not seen it . 
^ i did n't think he would appreciate it , but perhaps i shall send it to him after all . 
^ see you later .

^ i have seen this b4 , but it is amusing and very clever . 
^ has &name seen it ?

^ the following is an actual question given on a university of &name chemistry mid term . 
^ the answer was so profound that the professor shared it with colleagues , which is why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well . 
^ bonus question : is hell exothermic ( gives off heat ) or endothermic ( absorbs heat ) ? 
^ most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using &name 's law , ( gas cools off when it expands and heats up when it is compressed ) or some variant . 
^ &num student , however , wrote the following : 
^ first , we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time . 
^ so we need to know the rate that souls are moving into hell and the rate they are leaving . 
^ i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell , it will not leave . 
^ therefore , no souls are leaving . 
^ as for how many souls are entering hell , lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today . 
^ some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion , you will go to hell . 
^ since there are more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than &num religion , we can project that all souls go to hell . 
^ with birth and death rates as they are , we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially . 
^ now , we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because &name 's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same , the volume of hell has to expand as souls are added . 
^ this gives &num possibilities : 
^ &num if hell is expanding at slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell , then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose . 
^ &num of course , if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell , then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over . 
^ so which is it ? 
^ if we accept the postulate given to me by ms. &name &name during my freshman year , ( ... that it will be a cold day in hell before i sleep with you ) , and take into account the fact that i still have not succeeded in having sexual relations with her , then , # &num cannot be true , and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and will not freeze . 
^ the student received the only a given .
