^ wow , your fascination with sewage amazes me ... &smiley

^ well , it was made interesting by the museum ... otherwise it tends to be a fairly dull subject , i agree . 
^ plus of course , there were all the engines etc. that really made the museum what it was . 
^ and boys do tend to like big ( working ) engines with lots of levers and pumps and all the mechanical bits encased in this beautifully sculpted metal ... well , you get the point ! 
^ the industrial revolution was , after all , male dominated . 
^ and i do like learning about local history , and though it was sewage-orientated , it does give something of an insight into the city 's history . 
<text_embedded> 

^ how about a coffee meet-up ? 
^ in town somewhere around 4ish ? 
</text_embedded>

^ sounds great . 
^ not sure if you have anywhere in particular in mind ... there are loads of places round &name and i 've barely been to any of them ! 
^ cafe &name was n't bad when i went there earlier this term . 
<text_embedded> 

^ do n't panic about me not checking email ... i think i 'm practically addicted as it is and hopefully i 'm getting my laptop networked at some point tomorrow and then there 'll be no stopping me ! !

^ i was suitably impressed by the fact that i got a reply this evening ! 
^ see you tomorrow ,

</text_embedded>

^ well , it was my fault really . 
^ you did indicate that you were n't sure and i did have the termcard in my inbox . 
^ i should have checked . 
<text_embedded> 

^ i checked the time at about &num and thought " hmm , i could go &name went right now but i have n't had lunch and my boots need waxing and my waterproof trousers really are n't waterproof . ... so i gave up in the end . 
</text_embedded>

^ perhaps just as well i did n't press on alone to waterbeach then ? ! 
^ the weather really was unpleasant and just walking the distance between &name bridge and &name common was quite enough for me . 
<text_embedded> 

^ had a really nice afternoon doing not very much instead though which was nice . 
^ i saw a friend from school and church who 's a fresher at &name now , so we had a good long chat and a pray , then went to &name 's and had chips on the way home &smiley so a very nice day . 
^ have you evet experienced &name 's evening service followed by &name road chip shop chips ? 
^ it 's a definite experience . ... you 'll have to try it some time ! 
</text_embedded>

^ all sounds good & a pleasant sunday . 
^ and it reminds me , there 's someone i know from school who 's just started at &name , so i 'll have to pop round and see her sometime soon . 
^ i have n't ever tried &name evening service , though i 've been told on a number of occasions that i should . 
^ perhaps i 'll do it in one of the forthcoming weeks &smiley 
^ i had a really interesting time at the museum of technology . 
^ it 's basically the old pumping station for &name and they 've restored all the engines and pumps etc. to working order and have lots of information about them and the sewage systems round &name ( sewage can be interesting - honestly ! ) did you know for example that until 1890-something ( &num ? ) the city 's sewage was basically dumped into the &name - imagine rowing then ! 
^ in fact until the 17th century , there was a big open &name running through &name ( called &name 's &name ) which everyone dumped their sewage into . 
^ not very pleasant - i 'm sure you can imagine the stench and disease that it caused ! 
^ in fact , you may have come accross &name 's conduit in &name . 
^ one of the main purposes of that was to flush out the sewage . 
^ anyway , in the late 19th century , they build this state-of-the-art pumping station which dealt with it all and there 's some really impressive machines there . 
^ in fact , the guy who took us round started one of the gas engines for us and explained how it all worked . 
^ plus they were ahead of time and were in on recycling - the boilers used household rubbish as their fuel ! 
^ anyway , if you 've some free time next weekend , it would be well worth going along , since they 'll have all the engines running next weekend as part of a special open day . 
^ see &website . 
<text_embedded> 

^ anyway , it would be good to meet up some time . . ... tues is good for me , i on;y have &num lecture at &num and a supervision at &num and a bible study group at some point but i 'm not sure when . ... so do you want to meet up for coffee or tea or something ? 
</text_embedded>

^ &name . 
^ tuesday is also good for me , but will obviously depend on how soon you check your e-mail as to whether we can get that sorted in time . 
^ i 'm free from &num until &num , and then from &num onwards . 
^ do you want to meet up for lunch somewhere ( suggested within the first time slot ) or for a coffee ( 2nd time slot ) ? 
^ depends of course on when your &name is . 
^ look forward to seeing you soon , 
^ take care , 
^ love &name 
<text_embedded> 

^ see you somewhere anyway . 
^ &name all is going well for you at the moment , and sorry about sending you completely the wrong time ... oops ...
