^ hi ! 
^ hope things are well with you . 
^ our department e-mailed us today to tell us that the class lists have been published and put up , which is a few days earlier than we 'd been expecting them . 
^ i was just wondering , as you 're still in &name for graduation , whether you 'd be willing to go to &name house for me & let me know by e-mail what my class is ? 
^ if you do n't have time , then do n't worry about it , but i 'd be very grateful if you do ! 
^ the tripos is : computer science &name ( &num ) my candidate number is : &num 
^ all the best for graduation and for your summer , 
^ many thanks ,
