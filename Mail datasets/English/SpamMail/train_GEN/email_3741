^ hi &name , 
^ re peterbrough , i think it is looking likely that i will want you to go to the station at &name , if that is okay with you . 
^ it will save a lot of time , i think . 
^ the trip in fuel , according to the &name will cost &pound; &num each way , so split between the &num of us , that will be about &pound; &num or &num each . 
^ i hope that is okay . 
^ talk soon , 
^ &name
