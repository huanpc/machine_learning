^ from what i remember of the rehearsal after the concert there was a democratic vote that the ladies should be boring and wear black . 
^ however there was no vote as to whether the men should be able to be more festive in the bow-tie department . 
^ it was assumed that because the ladies were boring the men ought to be , as the men did not vote on the appearance of the ladies it seems unfair that their decision should be foist upon the men . 
^ i suggest they should all bring black bow-ties and another of their choice and have a democratic vote on the day .
