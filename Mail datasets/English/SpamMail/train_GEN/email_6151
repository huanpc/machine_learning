^ dear &name , 
^ first of all &char wanted to thank you for your letter which was very welcoming and makes me look even more forward to moving in &name , meeting new people and settling in my new life . 
^ i probably should introduce myself as well , even though you seem to already know most of what i am going to tell you . 
^ so my name is &name and i am french . 
^ i will spend &num years in &name as i am doing a combined course with a french university where i 'll spend &num years afterwards . 
^ i almost forgot , i will be studying law . 
^ so here we are we approximately know as much about each other ! ! ! 
^ apart from that i have few stupid and material questions which are bothering me ( and my mum ! ! ! ! ) , and as you are the only student i got in touch with so far i was wondering if you 'd mind helping me out . 
^ you 'll see it is very basic but i am trying to organise all the stuff i have to pack ! 
^ i wanted to know if on the beds we had a blanket or a duna and if whatever it is , is warm enough in winter ; if there were some small lamps on the desk and near the bed or if we had to bring our owns ; and finally if it was easy to leave some stuff at the university during the holidays or if we really had to be careful not to take too much because it is such a pain to take everything back each time ! 
^ that 's it for my questions , i think that for the rest i should be fine by just guessing . 
^ so if you have a minute i would very much appreciate if you could give me some answers , but if you do n't, do n't worry as as you can see it is everything but vital ! ! ! 
^ &name &char must go and and try to approach the french administrations today again ! 
^ thank you very much again for your letter . 
^ i am very much looking forward to meeting you , enjoy the end of your holidays and see you soon .
