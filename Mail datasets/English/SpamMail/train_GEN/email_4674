^ hi everyone . 
^ just thought i 'd send out a joint email to let you know where i 'm at &name i 've just got last term 's practical and exam results . 
^ you are receiving this email because : &num ) you actually asked me to let you know how my exams went . 
^ &num ) you recently expressed a general interest in how things are going in my life . 
^ &num ) i believe you might be at least mildly interested in the following information . 
^ if none of those apply to you , then please read no further . 
^ so , my results were pretty good - i got over &num in &num of my exams and between 65-70% in the other . 
^ i got over &num in all my &num practical assignments . 
^ this leaves me with an overall average thus far of between 75-80% . 
^ i only have my project to go ( i love project work ) , which is due in on the 23rd july . 
^ the &name i 'm doing is only graded on a pass / fail basis , but i need to get a high score to have a chance of being funded for a phd which i 'm considering doing in a year 's time . 
^ next year i will be taking a break from the academic lifestyle to do something else , probably including going to &name &name for part of the year . 
^ sweet love to everyone and &name be with you ,
