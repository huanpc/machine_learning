^ dear intrepid &name , 
^ here i am with this week 's blurb ! 
^ firstly , just a bit of encouragement in the new intrep finding department ... 
^ do be getting on the case with your reps now , and then get asking once reps have been found . 
^ if you have any queries or uncertainties about this then please please get in touch and i 'll try and be of some use in helping - thats what i 'm here for ! 
^ and once you do have someone , please could you let me know who they are ? 
^ and also let your successors know that training will be on wednesday 23rd april ( very exciting and important and useful and crucial and fun ! ) 
^ secondly . ... intbrek this week ... " i know what you did last summer ! " this week we 're going to be hearing from some ciccu people who got involved in different kinds of gospel work in the summer , this is a good time of year to be thinking about how we are going to use the summer vacation , so do encourage your college group bods to be coming along on thursday and hearing about what some other people got up to ! 
^ ( its not that early really and the food is yum ! ) will be great to hear about and we 'll get to pray a bit for the work they 've been involved in too . 
^ thursday , 8am - 8.50am , in the building of &name &name the &name church , see you there ! 
^ and thirdly , as promised , here below is some stuff to be praying for &name if you want to be doing that in your college group meetings this week ... if you 're not then do have a read and be praying yourselves anyway ! 
^ and thats all i think ! 
^ love from &name xxx 
^ praying for &name ... 
^ please pray that the planning for the weekend away goes smoothly ( we 're going for a weekend at the end of term to &name which will be spent reading the bible and having fun ! ) . 
^ pray that when the publicity comes out many internationals would be excited by the idea . 
^ pray for the reps as they continue with the planning . 
^ pray that his &name would be at work in the hearts of those internationals who do not yet know him , directing them to his word and opening their minds so that as they read they can see the word in all his glory and make a right response . 
^ pray that we would be bolder in our conversations , that we would pursue genuine friendships that will provide us with opportunities to share the gospel on a more personal level . 
^ pray for those who are preparing the &name ( evangelistic bible study ) . 
^ pray that &name 's &name &name would be with them as they prepare the questions , that they would be focused on the message he wants the internationals there to hear . 
^ pray for the &name itself , that people would go along and hear &name 's word proclaimed ! 
^ pray for ... c from &name . 
^ she is buddhist and for a number of reasons not very happy at the moment . 
^ &name &name will meet her in her needs . 
^ &char and &char , keep praying that they 'll come to a personal faith in &name &name .
