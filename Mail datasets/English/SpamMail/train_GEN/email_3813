^ dear &name , 
^ not to be too picky , but you left out " i 'm glad " in 
^ " you know , i 'm glad , i need the rest " . 
^ &name , sounds like a very strange weekend indeed . 
^ i think i know what you mean about trying to be independent in a dependent way . 
^ i suppose it is most obvious when we make wrong choices ( independently of &char & &char ) , and then are told they are wrong by &char or &char rather than discovering this on our own ( as an independent individual would ) . 
^ it does n't help that while i am independent by necessity ( distance , etc ) you are independent by choice ( maturity , etc ) which is probably harder for &char & &char to deal with . 
^ incidentally , i 'm sure it 's hard for both of them but mum is the more outspoken . 
^ i think the mum resting issue is a different one , and perhaps not one we can do much about , other than offer to help ( as opposed to forcing help upon her ) . 
^ it might be worth mentioning to dad since he would probably have more luck . 
^ someone once said : 
^ " you know you 're still young when you 're reminiscing about last year . " 
^ i do n't wish it was last year but i can imagine that you do . 
^ you certainly had a lot of good things going for you . 
^ i was wondering how you see this msc fitting into your " career plan " that you drafted up at the end of the summer , given your comments to me that you did n't want to do a phd ? 
^ do n't worry about missing &name . 
^ even when we were first going out i missed &name , though i did n't always know what it was that i missed about her . 
^ it is difficult , i know . 
^ i 'm sure mum 's perspective is a right one , too , but she has the advantage of &num years of marriage , whereas we do n't have that stability yet . 
^ so i guess the ( sometimes somewhat pathetic ) missing of &name / &name is just a reflection of a desire for some assurance that everything is still okay . 
^ &name , i realise in re-reading that paragraph why i am not a relationship counsellor . 
^ very clumsily put , but do you get what i 'm saying ? 
^ i 'm glad that you did enjoy some aspects of the weekend ! 
^ i 'll do my best to be entirely wicked next weekend to take the heat off you . 
^ look out &name ... which bone will it be ? 
^ &smiley 
^ &name of the day for visual &name ... test your code as you go along . 
^ do n't try and write huge sections at once as debugging is a lot harder that way ! 
^ over and out , 
^ &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ everything you 'll ever need on &num web page from &name and sport to email and music charts &website
