^ hi professor &name , 
^ i just got back to &name today from &name ( definitely had a great time over there and enjoyed talking to dr. &name ) and i 'll probably be going to visit &org tomorrow . 
^ i was wondering if you were available at all this week ( or early next week ) for me to stop by and chat for a little bit to catch up and everything . 
^ i know you just got back from a long trip in &name , so if you are too busy , i obviously understand . 
^ also , if you would rather chat after the day is over , we could meet in a bar or something - i definitely owe you a drink for your contributions to helping me get into all those schools &smiley 
^ also , i was wondering if you know if there are any &name meeting scheduled in the next week . 
^ anyway , hope all is well . 
^ &name
