^ when a &name-made &name is scanned with &name &name , it alerts on " &website " virus . 
^ when searching &name website about this virus , they say " no additional information " . 
^ i think &name &name &name &name 's &name &name code with this virus . 
^ possibly , &name will fix this ( false ) alert . 
^ but , anyway , i think you should contact them to help them fix it , or fix &name &name code yourself . 
^ i seize the opportunity of this email to ask you for the next &name version . 
^ when will it be ? 
^ yours sincerily .
