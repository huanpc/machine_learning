" [  um ] they deliberately ignore this fact , that by the word of  ame heavens existed long ago , and an earth formed out of water and by means of water , [  um ] through which the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished . ^ " all things have continued as they were from the beginning of creation . " ^ - this is surely the theory of uniformitarianism ! ^ the passage above is talking about people who say that there was no flood - that the world is as we know it now ( the present is the key to the past ) . ^ this is not what the  ame teaches . ^ the  ame teaches that " the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished . " this is an argument against the assumptions that you base dating methods on . ^ we cannot judge the past from the present because the world that existed before the flood ( if the flood happened then it happened within recorded history ) is not the same as the world that now exists . ^ this passage is from the new testament - it is most certainly not metaphorical ! ^ c ya " ^  ame ^ " t.s.  ame " wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^  ame wrote : <text_embedded> ^  ame & friends , ^ interesting email . ^ i do not think it is as clear-cut as your friend would have us think . ^ just because science suggests something at this stage in history does n't mean that subsequent discoveries will not mean that our current hypotheses ( for after all , this is all we have ) must be radically changed / revised . </text_embedded>^ however , at this time , science indicates with overwhelming evidence that what i say is true . <text_embedded> ^ having said that , it is obviously important not to ignore what science is telling us today , </text_embedded>^ then why do you ?

^ full article at :  ebsite </text_embedded>^ unfortunately the 20th century has witnessed a revival of biblical scholasticism in some circles , often alienating the scientific community from the gospel quite unnecessarily in the process . ^ to take a specific example , following centuries of " industry and  ame " the scientific evidence that the earth we inhabit is many millions of years old has become overwhelming . ^ it requires a deliberate refusal to face the evidence , worthy of an ostrich , to continue to believe that the earth is , for example , only  um thousand years old . ^ an obscurantist clinging to such a belief runs counter to the commitment , common to both science and christianity , to tell the truth about  ame 's world . ^ furthermore , the idea that the  ame expounds science is difficult to reconcile with the contemporary understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge , for reasons that will become clearer below . ^  ame  ame is  ame of the  ame laboratory in the dept. of immunology , the  ame institute ,  ame , and is also editor of the journal science & christian belief ^  ame bausor article found at :  ebsite ^ what sort of science does  ame teach ? ^  ame is not a word which is in everyday use these days . ^ but it is quite useful when we are thinking about  ame . ^ it comes from the latin for transparent . ^ the idea was important to the christians in the reformation period because they wanted to emphasise that everyone could read the bible for themselves , without the need for a priest to interpret it for them . ^ so they spoke about the perspicuity of scripture . ^ the point is that you do n't have to be an expert in hebrew , or in jewish theology , or in literary styles in order to understand the main point of what the  ame is saying ( and for our purposes what  ame is saying ) . ^ but the other side is that you do need to ask , " what is the main point of this verse ( or chapter , or book ) ? " . ^ in other words , the reformers " idea that the  ame is accessible to anyone does not imply that you are entitled to read it for what it is not , or naively assume that the context in which it was written was the same as ours . ^ so what is the first chapter of  ame about ? ^ is it trying to give us a scientific account of how the earth or the universe came about ? ^ this seems unlikely , since science did not exist until a long time after  ame was compiled . ^ the issues then were different . ^ at the time  ame was written the sun and the moon were generally regarded as gods . ^ so when , in  ame  um , the ordinary hebrew words for sun and moon are carefully avoided in favour of the expressions " greater light to rule the day " and " lesser light to rule the night " , this could well be to avoid using the normal words for sun and moon in case they were seen to stand for gods . ^ in the contemporary babylonian stories of creation there were also sea monsters , representing chaos , which had to be subdued before creation could start . ^  ame emphasises that everything was created by  ame including the sea monsters . ^ it has been suggested that , when  ame  um was first written it would have seemed like a polemical political tract , attacking orthodox belief ( sun- and moon-gods and chaos-inducing sea monsters ) . ^ so what is the main point of  ame chapter  um ? ^ it is not difficult to see that what it is focusing on is that  ame did it all , just by his 'say-so " ( interesting , is n't it , that our expression corresponds so well ) . ^ there were no competing alternative gods or sources of power . ^ and  ame did it in a planned , careful way . ^ there to be seen , if you look , is the careful structure of the account . ^ day  um creation of lights to rule  ame  um separation of the light light and darkness and the darkness ^ day  um separation of the waters to  ame  um creation of birds and fish form the sky and the sea to fill the sky and the sea ^ day  um separation of the sea from  ame  um creation of the animals and the land and the creation of humans to fill the land and plants eat the plants . ^ there are also numerical aspects which are not obvious , but involve the numbers  um and  um which have great significance in the  ame : ^  um times ( "  ame blessed " , "  ame created " , "  ame created men and women " ) ; ^  um times ( " and it was so " , " and  ame saw that it was good " ) ; ^  um times ( "  ame said " -  um about humans ,  um about other things ; commands of creation : " let there be "  um times , and " let "  um times ) ; ^  um times " earth " and "  ame " are each mentioned ;  um hebrew words form the introduction ;  um hebrew words form the conclusion (  um :  um ) . ^ all this is very different from a scientific account . ^ it helps us to realise that the context in which  ame  um was written was one that is unfamiliar to us , and that its purpose was theological , not scientific . ^ so to ask whether  ame  um :  um -  um :  um is in contradiction to geology or evolution or any other aspect of science is really beside the point : it is not addressing those questions . ^ what it is doing is making a very strong pitch that the whole show was made , in a highly organised and deliberate way , by the only  ame , the all powerful ,  ame , the one who is in charge . ^  ame  ame is the secretary of christians in science education (  ame ) and was formerly the senior inspector for science of the inner  ame education authority . ^ ernest  ame footprints in the dust <text_embedded> ^ from article at :  ebsite </text_embedded>^  um  um years ago , at  um pm  ame time on july 20th ,  um  ame  ame stepped off the landing pad of the lunar module eagle and uttered the now famous words , " that 's  um small step for a man ,  um giant leap for mankind " . ^  har human being had set foot on the moon for the first time . ^ television pictures and photographs of the footprint he left in the dust on the  ame 's surface flashed around the earth . ^ those pictures showed that the dust was only a few inches (  um to be exact ) thick . ^ within a few years some christians were arguing that this thin layer of dust proved that the  ame ( and therefore the earth ) is only a few thousand years old . ^ their argument rested on an article by  ame  ame published in scientific american in  um . ^  ame measured the amount of atmospheric dust collected by filters on top of mount  ame  ame in  ame . ^ he knew that only a very small fraction of this dust came from  ame space , in the form of tiny meteorites . ^ meteoritic dust is known to contain more nickel than terrestrial dust , but how much more is a matter of guesswork . ^  ame made what he considered a reasonable guess , and on this basis used the amount of nickel in his dust samples to calculate the amount of dust from  ame space which settles on the earth each year . ^ he stressed the very speculative nature of his conclusion that  um million tons of such dust reach the earth 's surface annually . ^ this leads the authors of the book scientific creationism , published in  um , to argue that if the  ame were  um billion years old , as astronomers claim , it should have had several feet of dust on its surface , not a few inches . ^ they even say that astronomers were dismayed by how little dust there was . ^ this last comment , which is repeated in other such books , is quite untrue . ^ the amount of dust on the  ame was a matter of great interest to nasa . ^ a very thick layer would have made landing on the  ame , and moving around on its surface , difficult . ^ leaving it again might also have been problematical . ^ however , by  um , a year before  ame landed , it was clear that there was nothing to worry about . ^ satellites orbiting above the earth 's atmosphere had been used to measure the amount of dust in space , and on this basis it had been estimated that there would be a layer of dust about  um inches thick on the  ame , if meteoric dust alone were the cause . ^ ( this work , and other evidence , was surveyed by  har  har  ame in  um in  ame , vol.  um pp.  um ) . ^ of course , there would be more than that because there was evidence of past volcanic activity on the  ame , and that would produce dust too . ^ so the  um inches actually found was more or less as expected . ^ since this evidence had been published in  um it is surprising that a book claiming to be scientific , published  um years later is unaware of it , or ignores it . ^ one of the basic rules of good scientific work is that you must keep up to date with what is being published in the area in which you are working . ^ if you fail to do this you risk basing your conclusions on out-of-date evidence or disproven arguments . ^ it is amazing to find people associated with what is called the institute for creation research falling into this basic trap . ^ it undermines confidence in the quality of their science and their research . ^ it is even more amazing to find a book published in  um ( the facts of life by  ame  ame ) , and highly acclaimed by advocates of the " young earth " theory , still quoting the argument about the lack of dust on the  ame , based solely on  ame 's  um paper , and apparently totally ignorant of all the relevant new evidence that has accumulated in the  um years since then . ^ the fact is that the evidence of the surface of the moon does indicate its great age . ^ before  um artists " depictions of the surface of the  ame , such as the famous paintings produced by  ame  ame in the 1940's and "  ame showed extremely jagged mountains and rocks . ^ there was some reason in this . ^ the  ame has no significant atmosphere , so its surface cannot be eroded by wind and rain . ^ however , the pictures brought back by  ame  um and subsequent  ame missions show rocks and mountains that are rounded as if worn down by erosion . ^ examination of the rocks brought back to earth revealed the reason for this . ^ surfaces that had been buried in the dust are sharp and jagged . ^ those that had been exposed are covered with small pits . ^ these are , no doubt , the result of the impact of meteoric dust . ^ on the basis of the known average mass of interplanetary dust grains and the velocity with which they strike the  ame ,  ame and  ame estimated the rate of erosion of the  ame 's surface . ^ the figure they arrived at was about  um feet in a billion years . ^ in reality it would be much less than this because the debris is not removed and so forms a protective covering of dust which absorbs the impact of subsequent meteorites . ^ however , even at the maximum rate , in  um ,  um years ( the kind of age of the earth that the authors of scientific creationism argue for ) the surface of the moon would have been eroded by  um millionths of an inch , producing a virtually undetectable coating of dust ! ^ this work was published in  um and should have been known , and taken into account , by the authors of scientific creationism . ^ does the failure of these authors to be up to date really matter ? ^ yes , for several reasons . ^ first of all , christians should be concerned about the truth . ^ the  ame we are committed to is the  ame of truth (  ame  um :  um ) . ^ of all people , christians should be most punctilious about using only those arguments that are based on sound methods of scholarship and the best evidence available . ^ this is a matter of obedient christian discipleship , not simply a desire to look good in the eyes of other scholars . ^ secondly , following from this , it is dishonouring to  ame when christian scholars are found to be using sloppy arguments based on out-of-date evidence - and i know secular scholars who have little respect for christianity because of this . ^ finally , it is a matter of considerable pastoral and evangelistic importance . ^ christian scholars who wrongly claim to be presenting sound 'scientific " arguments are misleading their fellow christians who read their books . ^ most of these readers do not have either the opportunity or the inclination to check up on the reliability of the arguments used and evidence presented . ^ some of those readers may in time be stumbled in their faith because of their misplaced confidence in what they have read . ^ christian students who , with more zeal than  ame , confidently confront lecturers with arguments culled from books like scientific creationism have sometimes been made to look foolish when the lecturer has been able to show that the argument does not stand up to the evidence , even the evidence available when it was first put forward . ^ that has not only shaken the faith of the christians , but undermined their witness to their fellow students . ^ perhaps publishers of books on 'scientific creationism " , and the managers of bookshops which sell them , ought to consider putting a spiritual health warning on them . ^
