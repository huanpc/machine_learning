^ sorry mate - you ca n't get away with a statement like that . 
^ in golf you have to move over a distance of many miles ( when i play , many , many , many miles ) . 
^ &num other thing , in hockey you 're only playing for a short time , before you ajourn to the bar . 
^ in golf , you play for many hours - you need enduring stamina , as well as skill ! 
^ - and there 's no violence on a golf course like you see in hockey ( or is that ice hockey ? ! ! ! ! ) 
^ i do admire your rather feeble efforts to defend hockey - sorry they do n't work on me ! 
^ i must now get on with the job of ministry !
