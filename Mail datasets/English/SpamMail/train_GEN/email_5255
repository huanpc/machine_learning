^ it all sounds good ... do you want to do the invitation and collect the &name ? 
^ maybe we should have a club social secretary ...

^ yes , i 'll do that . 
^ do you think it 's worth waiting until we get confirmation ? 
^ shall we wait and see if we hear from &name , and then decide which garden we prefer ? 
^ i 'm inclined just to get on with it . 
^ i 'm a bit worried about &name not being there ( and generally all undergrads leaving even before may week ! ) . 
^ i 'll ask tonight how many people that 's likely to affect . 
^ &name says there are &num kingsians in the books so we should be fine .

^ that 's fantastic . 
^ thanks , &name ! 
^ it has occurred to me that some undergraduates might have left by the friday , as it is technically after the end of term . 
^ do you get chucked out immediately or will you be able to stay till then ? 
^ ( i know &name people have to leave by friday morning - i think that 's ridiculous myself ... ) 
^ see you tonight ?

^ ok , i have booked the fellows garden for friday the 20th of june , between 5pm and 8pm . 
^ i did n't know how many people are gonna go so i gave a rough estinate of &num people . 
^ the booking needs to be approved by the council ( which apparently is not gonna be a problem ) 
^ there is a refundable charge of &pound; &num ( assuming the garden is left in the same state as it was before ) and a non-refundable charge of &pound; &num for the rubbish &name . 
^ regards . 
^ &name 
^ or otherwise thursday
