^ &name told me to keep them .

^ following yesterday 's concert , does anyone know what happened to : 
^ &num &num boxes used for programmes - a box which originally housed a small heater and another which originally was for a music system . 
^ has anyone seen either ? 
^ i use them at the start and end of each term for transporting things to and from college & they 're rather useful sizes , so having them back would be really helpful ! 
^ &num the long-armed stapler used for the programmes 
^ &num my scissors and pritt-stick 
^ if anybody else has mislaid anything , let me know . 
^ thanks !
