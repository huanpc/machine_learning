^ this is a reminder that you have not yet got a tick for the first experiment of the &name &name . 
^ if you have problems with the practical please get in touch as soon as possible , either with a demonstrator , myself or your course advisor . 
^ in general you should not aim to get all the ticks in one go at the end of the practical as the demonstrators will not have enough time . 
^ you should try to obtain the ticks as you go along from the first to the third experiment . 
^ thus we expect that the first experiment is done during the the first &num weeks of the speech1 practical .
