^ what do you think dad ? 
^ hi &name , 
^ thanks very much for the card . 
^ i love the picture of the mountains . 
^ we really do n't get as impressive features as that in &name ! 
^ thanks for your thoughts on the subject of my coming to the states to shoot some film . 
^ i think that it would be a good experience , however , i do not think that the idea is feasible at the moment . 
^ the prospect of an individual study trip for my course would probably not be easy to implement at this stage in my studies , as i still have a long way to go before i atually know enough to do anything of worth without my tutors . 
^ as you mentioned , it would be easy for me to work in the states , as i am a us citizen . 
^ so perhaps sometime in the future the plan might possibly work . 
^ nevertheless , as it stands now , i will have to leave it as a future possibility .
