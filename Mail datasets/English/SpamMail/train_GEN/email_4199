^ hi &name , 
^ i hope you have fun with your parents today too ! 
^ it 's great that they could stay for so long . 
^ i ca n't wait until the holidays ... to start with revision ... &name ! 
^ we did have quite a good discussion on wednesday , although &name was n't there . 
^ we were joined by a new guys called &name , and so that was good . 
^ no brownies last week , but chocolate chip cookies ! ! ! 
^ last week we were looking at the crucifiction of &name , and what it meant . 
^ some of the points which we looked at in the following passage . . . ... 
^ the crucifixion 
^ &num certain man from &name , &name , the father of &name and &name , was passing by on his way in from the country , and they forced him to carry the cross . 
^ 22they brought &name to the place called &name ( which means the place of the skull ) . 
^ 23then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh , but he did not take it . 
^ &name they crucified him . 
^ dividing up his clothes , they cast lots to see what each would get . 
^ 25it was the third hour when they crucified him . 
^ 26the written notice of the charge against him read : the king of the &name . 
^ 27they crucified &num robbers with him , one on his right and one on his left. [ &num ] 29those who passed by hurled insults at him , shaking their heads and saying , 'so ! 
^ you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in &num days , 30come down from the cross and save yourself ! " 31in the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves . 
^ " he saved others , " they said , " but he ca n't save himself ! 
^ 32let this &name , this &name of &name , come down now from the cross , that we may see and believe . " those crucified with him also heaped insults on him . 
^ the death of &name 
^ 33at the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour . 
^ 34and at the ninth hour &name cried out in a loud voice , " &name , &name , lama sabachthani?' --which means , 'my &name , my &name , why have you forsaken me ? " 35when some of those standing near heard this , they said , " listen , he 's calling &name . " &name man ran , filled a sponge with wine vinegar , put it on a stick , and offered it to &name to drink . 
^ " now leave him alone . 
^ let 's see if &name comes to take him down , " he said . 
^ 37with a loud cry , &name breathed his last . 
^ 38the curtain of the temple was torn in &num from top to bottom . 
^ 39and when the &name , who stood there in front of &name , heard his cry and saw how he died , he said , 'surely this man was the &name of &name ! " 40some women were watching from a distance . 
^ among them were &name &name , &name the mother of &name the younger and of &name , and &name . 
^ 41in &name these women had followed him and cared for his needs . 
^ many other women who had come up with him to &name were also there . 
^ the burial of &name 
^ &name was &name &name ( that is , the day before the sabbath ) . 
^ so as evening approached , 43joseph of &name , a prominent member of the council , who was himself waiting for the kingdom of &name , went boldly to &name and asked for &name " body . 
^ 44pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead . 
^ summoning the &name , he asked him if &name had already died . 
^ 45when he learned from the &name that it was so , he gave the body to &name . 
^ &name &name bought some linen cloth , took down the body , wrapped it in the linen , and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock . 
^ then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb . 
^ 47mary &name and &name the mother of &name saw where he was laid . 
^ vs &num - darkness in the middle of the day ( sixth hour ) the old testament makes it clear that darkness is a sign of &name 's anger . 
^ &name was angry at jesus . 
^ why was this ? 
^ &name was angry at the only man who ever lived a perfect life , because &name had taken on himself all the wrongdoings that we have commited all our lives . 
^ and because &name is a just god , this sin had to be punished . 
^ if it was n't for &name , we would have to face that wrath of &name ourselves . 
^ because of him , we do n't. 
^ vs &num - &name dies . 
^ with this , the rescue is complete . 
^ the punishment is paid . 
^ we are free . 
^ ve &num - " the curtain of the temple was torn in &num from top to bottom . " this curtain was inches thick , and separated the people from the part of the jewish temple which was called the holy of holies . 
^ that was where no one was allowed except the high priest , and he only once a year . 
^ now , ripped from top to bottom , not by human hands , we are all able to have a relationship with the almighty , all powerful creator &name , because he humbled himself so much that he came to earth , to pay for our sins himself . 
^ that is how much &name loves us . 
^ that is why &name came , and that is why he died . 
^ look forward to seeing you next wednesday , and if you have any questions , feel free to e-mail or call me ( mobile ( vodaphone ) &num &num &num &num ) or just bring them along to explore on wednesday . 
^ &name all is well , &name &name &name &name
