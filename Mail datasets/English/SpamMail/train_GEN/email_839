^ greetings , my good serf &name , 
^ " ' why , then , did you not reply ? ? ? " i hear you cry . " 
^ - your hearing is remarkably acute . 
^ " how 's &name ? " 
^ - considerably worse off for being spelt incorrectly ; it has &num &char 's. 
^ otherwise , it is lovely . 
^ i came home to discover a multitude of blue cornflowers flowering in our garden . 
^ they are lovely . 
^ i like blue flowers . 
^ " and &name ? " 
^ - well , and in near constant use by my brother . 
^ were you perhaps expecting her to be other than &num percent ? 
^ " i 've been away at a christian school 's convention for the last week or so , and hence i have been electronically silent for a while . " 
^ - that would explain it . 
^ " while i was away the weather was amazing ! ! ! 
^ ( &name hot , that is ) and i now look even more like &name &name with my newly-acquired sun tan . " 
^ - you are very amusing ! 
^ " glad to hear you 're keeping yourself busy , and even more that you feel happy ! 
^ &name , a rare and enjoyable state . " 
^ - it should n't be . 
^ " &name henman might get to the final ! ! ! ! " 
^ - is this football ? 
^ do n't worry , i know it 's really tennis . 
^ 'my computers are all well , and they send you the very worst of regards . " 
^ - i 've already sent them the worst of regards . 
^ i did it &num wednesday a few weeks ago 
^ " it 's &name 's birthday tomorrow - do n't forget to send her a card , or phone her or something ( as if you would ! ! ! ) . " 
^ - i know it is . 
^ when you say " as if you would " , do you mean as if i would forget to send a card , or as if i would telephone her ? 
^ " i 'm now going to say bye bye . " 
^ - &name , you know your own mind ! 
^ amazing . 
^ " when you say 'very best wishes " i bet you are lying - i bet you did n't wish anything for me . 
^ ca n't you say something a little more truthful , such as " i 'm going now " ? ? ? " 
^ - i 'm insulted . 
^ what is a wish , and who does one wish to ? 
^ who is the wish-giver , and will he give them ? 
^ i think i am being truthful when i say very best wishes . 
^ i think " i 'm going now " would be less truthful , since i think i remained seated at &name and wrote another e-mail . 
^ now , although i have said " i think " &num times in the last &num sentences , it may be less truthful than saying 'very best wishes " , because i did not . 
^ it was merely a phrase , with properties intended to convey that which i wish to be conveyed as the mood of my writing . 
^ do you think people should speak more plainly ? 
^ does the english language need to be re-examined ? 
^ i wish i knew , but did i ? 
^ was that true ? 
^ thank you for taking the time to read this letter . 
^ perhaps you would like to fill in the speech bubbles of the attached photograph . 
^ they could be humorous ( that 's a subtle hint ) . 
^ and so , i shall say it once more 
^ very best wishes , 
^ since it is true , and wishes i do wish for you . 
^ &name 
^ p.s. you are quite welcome to send me a picture message any time ( that is another subtle hint ) . 
^ &name who is " &name " ( subject line ) ?
