^ dear &name , 
^ hello . 
^ you may have wondered why i have been so silent for the past week , then again you may not . 
^ well , the reason is because dear old &name was very ill . 
^ she contracted a nasty computer virus last wednesday . 
^ this malicious program did not allow her to open any applications , like word , &name explorer , etc. anyway , after downloading a little program from our anti-virus company 's web-site and injecting &name with it she is now back to her old cheerful self . 
^ her first encounter with a computer virus - quite interesting . 
^ i saw your bridesmaid-to-be yesterday when he arrived in &name &name . 
^ i must say i ca n't picture him as a bridesmaid . 
^ it will be a very odd wedding . 
^ i have only &num more days of work left ! ! ! 
^ o joy ! 
^ then i will be going back to lovely &name on monday . 
^ so what have you done this week ? 
^ are you all prepared for next term yet ? 
^ ( i certainly am not anyway . ) are you still going to post those photos , or would you rather give them to me at &name ? 
^ hope you are well and having a good time . 
^ it would be nice to chat sometime soon if you like . 
^ have a good evening , 
^ &name
