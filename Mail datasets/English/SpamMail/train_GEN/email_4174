^ hi &name , you do lead an exciting life over there ! 
^ thanks for the e-mail . 
^ we just heard from your dad yesterday that he is coming over to &name in july and we 're trying to work it out so he can come to our cottage for &name 's 50th birthday party . 
^ this time we 're only having a small party ( &num or so ) but it would be wonderful if he could come too . 
^ next monday &name and &name leave to go to camp for the summer . 
^ it will be very quiet and different around here and we will miss them very much . 
^ however , i think that it will be an amazing experience for them . 
^ i probably told you this but it is a catholic boys camp for underprivileged kids . 
^ it is definitely a christian camp with prayer services and mass . 
^ i think that it will be a real learning experience for both of them . 
^ this has been an amzing year for me spiritually . 
^ i was the &name ambassador for our school which means that i tried to provide experiences &website the staff 's spiritual development . 
^ we also had many retreats throughout the year which were wonderful . 
^ i also participated in a program at our church which welcomed back returning catholics . 
^ we met in a small group of &num with &num returning catholics and &num active &num . 
^ it was wonderful to hear everyone 's faith story and share my own . 
^ now i am taking a religion course and &name and i are planning our trip to &name in august . 
^ it is a faith journey tracing &name " steps during his lifetime . 
^ i will definitely have to write about it ( it is a requirement of our course also ) and send it to you .
