^ ok &name , i may have been a bit too harsh on this so i would like you to check this through and take out any comments which are wrong or badly put . 
^ then i want you to put it through &name and then give it to &name ( if it gets that far ) . 
^ i think that we should stick to the common &name spelling of &name 's name which the &name &name dictionary of music ( music students " bible ) uses which is &name &name &name ( no umlaut ) . 
^ it might be worth referring &name to the &name &name online which is available on all university connections ( i used it to check the article ) : &website 
^ i 'm really bad at grammar so i did n't comment on this . 
^ i think that some sentences had too many commas though . 
^ &name 
^ i need some advice from a musician for the programme .

^ &char still have to do a grammar re-vamp etc. is it ok otherwise ? 
^ she 's happy to do more with it if it 's needed . 
^ as she 's spelt &name the way she has do we need to do that throughout the &name ?

^ is the passage at the end of this e-mail to which &name ( above ) is referring ok ? 
^ secondly , what about the spelling of &name ( ie. the use of the umlaut over the &char ) ? 
^ thanks , 
^ &name 
^ &name &name h' ndel 
^ &name &name h' ndel was born the son of a barber-surgeon in &name , &name on 23rd &name &num . 
^ from a family with no musical distinction , his father had never intended his son to study music but instead , law . 
^ however , before h' ndel 's tenth birthday , his musical talent had manifested itself so clearly , that his father was encouraged to allow him to study and become a pupil of &name , the principal organist in &name . 
^ this was the only formal musical instruction h' ndel would ever have . 
^ just after h' ndel 's seventeenth birthday , he began his first job , as the organist of &name , where he also studied law . 
^ in &num , he travelled to &name , which was the operatic centre of &name . 
^ it was in &num , here , that h' ndel composed his first opera , &name , which attained massive success in the following year . 
^ he then travelled to &name in around &num , to pursue his dream of being a successful operatic composer . 
^ here , he composed operas , oratorios , and many secular cantatas . 
^ the last composition in &name was &name , in &name in &num , which became a great success . 
^ h' ndel had achieved excellence and complete success in every musical genre during his time in &name . 
^ he left &name in early &num and briefly moved to &name , before he took up an invitation to &name , where his opera &name was produced early in &num . 
^ h' ndel composed &num more operas in &name , between &num , wrote music for the church and for court , and was awarded a royal pension . 
^ after composing many other operas , now his central interest , h' ndel visited &name in &num , where &name had its premiere in aid of charities . 
^ during his last decade , &name was regularly performed in h' ndel 's charity concerts at the &name hospital , raising money for underprivileged children ; thus making &name one of h' ndel 's best-known works . 
^ h' ndel died in &name on 14th april &num , and was buried in &name abbey . 
^ today he is recognised as the greatest composer of his day in &name and by many in &name .
