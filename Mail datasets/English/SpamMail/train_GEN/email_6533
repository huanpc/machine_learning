^ dear chorus members , 
^ i do hope you all enjoyed yesterday as much as i did ! 
^ it was a lovely concert - you all looked happy and sounded full of sparkle in the &name , and i think it was one of the most relaxed concerts we 've participated in for &name &name . 
^ it was a pity that the bulk of the audience was so inept , but you ca n't have everything i suppose . . . . ... incidentally the all-black looked very smart ! 
^ thanks to everyone for taking part , especially the people who travelled a long way to be there and in at least &num case had to arrange to stay overnight . 
^ it was much appreciated . 
^ there were &num of you on stage and they had asked for &name and &num so that was perfect . 
^ i hope you will all have a happy christmas , free of bugs and viruses , and i shall look forward to seeing you all again on january 16th at 7.30pm . 
^ ( &name &name , &name edition , and &name 'symphony of &name " ) . 
^ no doubt &name will be in touch about hiring / buying copies . 
^ if you hired the &name for yesterday and have not already given it to &name &name to return for you , i suggest that you get it back to &name &name , &num , &name street , as soon as possible . 
^ if you wait until the beginning of next term it will be too late to reclaim your deposit . 
^ best wishes , &name
