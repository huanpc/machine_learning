^ i appreciate the followup and clarification . 
^ i ran liveupdate on &name &name again today and now it allows me to run the &name created &name 's again . 
^ apparently we experienced a short-lived false alarm . 
^ again thanks for all help in clearing this up and congratulations on such a simple and effective program you have created in &name &name . 
^ &name &name &name 
^ &name &name support ( &email ) wrote&smiley you mentioned that " there is at least &num virus which has been packaged 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ with &name &name " . 
^ what is the virus and what is known about it ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i meant packaged " using " rather than " with " - sorry about the ambiguity . 
^ due to the nature of having &num software picked up as infected , i 've been receiving a lot of mail and writing replies rather hastily . 
^ i forget what the virus is exactly , i did get a proper name from &name ( i used to use their software and so when i got a sample of this virus by someone who 'd been infected , i submitted it as it was n't detected and they updated their software accordingly and gave it a name ) . 
^ that was an &name something virus &name . 
^ it is however very rare . 
^ i just get the ocassional e-mail accusing me of infecting someone 's computer because they 've seen " created with &name &name " and know they 've got a virus . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i know that 's a wide open question , but the more we know about it the better . 
^ we 're concerned that we may have infected some fairly influential clients and we want to be able to diffuse the situation as quickly as possible . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ it 's highly unlikely that you 've infected anyone else 's computers by use of &name &name , unless you got a virus from elsewhere . 
^ the fact that you were one of the first to report this problem to me , it indicates how seriously you ( like &num ) take protection against infection and therefore i highly doubt that you 've sent out viruses to your clients . 
^ i hope this helps . 
^ let me know if i can be of further assistance .

^ may &num , &num &name , i have been using your &name software for well over a year for distributing files to users in my firm . 
^ today , my boss was updating his &name software and it informed him that he had several viruses on his computer contained in .exe files which had all been created by &name . 
^ if you know what might be causing this issue we would greatly appreciate any clarification or insight you might be able to provide . 
^ i apologize for not using your &name key , but i do n't run any of the software that it interfaces with . 
^ thanks in advance for any information you can provide .

^ do you know what anti-virus software he has ? 
^ i suspect that it is a false-positive . 
^ very ocassionally i 've had problems with &name 's &name &name thinking that these files are viruses , generally when the " bloodhound " heuristic testing is enabled . 
^ in these cases a new update is generally released fairly quickly , provided someone tells them of the problem . 
^ the second possibility is that the files he has are not the &num you created , but files sent by e-mail or something which may indeed be a virus because there is at least &num virus which has been packaged with &name &name &smiley
