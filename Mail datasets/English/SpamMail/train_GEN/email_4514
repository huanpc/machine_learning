^ sorry to bother you again &name , 
^ so does that mean that if you are calling &name in a while loop , the loop will terminate if there is a buffer overrun , and there 's no way to test whether it 's an overrun or &name ? 
^ do you think the buffer size is likely to affect performance significantly ? 
^ thanks ,

^ a buffer overrun will not prevent &name from processing further sentences from that document ( it ignores the offending sentence ) , but since &name ( ) only returns a boolean there is no way to tell the difference between a buffer overrun and the end of file condition - both cases will return a value of false to the caller . 
^ eh 
^ hi &name , 
^ when the &name class has a buffer overrun , does it stop processing that &name document , or does it continue , ignoring that sentence ? 
^ thanks ,
