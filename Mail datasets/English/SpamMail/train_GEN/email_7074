^ hello everyone- hope you 've all had nice weekends ! 
^ sorry i did n't get this email out last night , but i needed some vital info beforehand ! ... here goes , read on ... 
^ the main event week is now upon us- comes quick does n't it ? ! 
^ let 's be praying this week that &name uses it for many valuable chats and questions about &name , and that he gives us boldness to share the gospel . 
^ here 's an outline of what 'll be happening this week : 
^ i 'm sure you all have the &name flyers which detail when the talks are and when and where . 
^ lunchtime talks monday to wednesday , then &num evening talks thursday to saturday . 
^ &name assures me there will be a group of people at the plodge each day to walk to the talks together , so get there a bit before if you can . 
^ &name to see you there- even if you 're not actually bringing anyone , it 's great to still come along to support it . 
^ we as a college cu are putting on a small event in &name &name court on thursday at &num there will be a speaker , &name &name , who 'll give a small presentation of the gospel at about &num . 
^ we 'll be having some puddings as well;- ) ... this presupposes your lovely selves coming and you bringing a pudding along with you / &num between &num depending on how hungry you are , so we can keep costs low . 
^ please bring a pudding with you ! 
^ it 'd be great to see you all there . 
^ and of course this is for our friends to come to- publicity will be going up , and there are flyers available to give to people if you want them- if you do , mail me or &name ( pjc64 / sdb32 ) and we will pigeon-hole them to you asap . 
^ event should be no longer than an hour-ish at the most , but feel free to come , give us ya pudding and go to a lecture or something&smiley 
^ &name this is clear so far 
^ wednesday we wo n't be having a college group meeting , as we do n't have a &name &name ( mission matters ) , and there are the &name to keep us praying ... 
^ daily prayer meetings are happening in the following locations- feel free to go to &num / none / all / start your own at a better time ... point is we 're lifting this up to &name and trusting in him alone . ... 
^ &name &name &name &name &name &name ( do n't know what room , go to east court and look for the name , i think it 's &num or &num ! ? ) &name &name &name &name &name 
^ here is a little message from &name &name , our international rep : 
^ &name put on a concert once a year , which aims at presenting the gospel to students . 
^ it 's a high-quality performance of &name &name 's passion this year . 
^ it 's in &name 's chapel , on the 15th feb at 8pm . 
^ for the concert we need volunteers to man the tickets stalls in &name &name between &name and 2pm on the weekdays between monday 3rd feb and &name 14th feb , which equates to &num hours . 
^ any volunteers ? 
^ also , the main purpose of this email is to highlight the thursday during &name ( on the &name termcard it says more information to follow ) . 
^ &name will be having a meal together on the thursday and going on to the first witness evening talk . 
^ please highlight this one to your college groups . 
^ anyone can come to the meal and bring their int friends , will be a great chance to meet others and very friendly thing to invite people along to ! 
^ the meal will be &num : &num in &name 's room in &name and then onto the talk . 
^ all are welcome , and if anyone knows they might be coming it 'd be helpful to let &name know for numbers ( ppjp2 ) . 
^ his room is immediately on the right as you go into &name . 
^ if you 've got this far you deserve a blue &name badge . 
^ hope you all have smashing weeks-this is not meant to be a super-evangelism week ; it 's just a time when we bring the definite need of those around us for &name into closer focus , and encourages us in our general outreach . 
^ so , god bless y' all and see you soon , in him , &name
