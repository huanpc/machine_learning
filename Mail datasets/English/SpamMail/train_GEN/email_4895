^ ok , so &name and &name - how is restream going on the &name side ? 
^ are we ready to integrate ? 
</text_embedded>

^ restream is already saving a string into the database . 
^ if you run the gui using the command : 
^ &name runverbose 
^ it will print out strings of how all of the boxes are stored in the database when you save and load . 
^ so if you get a current version of the &name you can create your own restream box and take a look at the string that it generates under the 'modifier " part . 
^ i can give you more specific information when i come in tomorrow .
