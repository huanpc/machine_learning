? ! ! ^  ame , you 've been to  ame - how cool ! ^ - no , it was freezing . ^ and wet . ^ did you see our chips ? ^ - no so , have they finally got the address lists printed now ? ^ - yes did you manage to get a copy of it ? ^ - yes you could n't send / scan / e-mail me a copy of it possibly could you ? ^ - possibly ^ now that you have your computer connected you may wish to consider netscape instant messaging service ^ - possibly . ^ where do i find it ? ^ forgive me for trying to be so intuitive , but could you possibly , feasibly , be looking forward to seeing your sister  ame on saturday ? ? ? ^ yes ! ^ she 's coming home today . ^ i was supposed to go down to  ame to collect her too , but i 'm not feeling too great this morning , so have stayed at home . ^ i could n't face the hours on end of sitting in the car getting all cramped up . ^ they are going to  ame after picking up  ame - for my aunt and uncle 's 25th wedding anniversary party . ^ shame i 'll miss it , but i ca n't say i 'm all that bothered . ^ yes , i like operating the till , but i do n't tend to salivate over it as it would appear you did - strictly reading between the lines . ^ you 're not too skilled in that area are you ? ^ i 'd definitely give you an f in "  ame between the lines "  ame ( oh , you do scottish thingys in your bizzare area of the country - well , whatever ! ) ^ however , the till made a funny noise at me yesterday , so i do n't know if it still likes me . ^ the answer is simple  ame . ^ he detected a nasty vibe from you . ^ he could tell you were going to make a nasty accusation towards a till-lover , so was trying to warn you against it . ^ you failed to recognise the sign . ^ oh  ame . ^ i 'll have to give you an f in "  ame between the beeps " too . ^ anyway , have you heard the latest from  ame ? ^ - heard from him on monday . ^ quite a stunning revelation if you ask me ^ - well , there was nothing extraordinary in what he said to me but i could see it coming . ^ - oh , have psychic powers now too do we ? ? ^ he 'd been acting quite strangely in our flat for some time . ^ - no comment he 'd also been acting quite strangely in your flat too - ask  ame . ^ he accompanied me downstairs to get a bin liner from her  um day . ^ curiouser and curiouser . ^ - i know all about that one . ^  ame told me . ^ you had her thoroughly bemused . ^ anyway , his latest personal statement ; " i have similar characteristics to an amphibious-type creature who has evolved  um million years in a few hours and has mysteriously taken on the form of a large slug with uncontrollable mating habit " ^ - sounds worrying . ^ we have a slug for a cu rep ? ^ perhaps worse : a cu rep with the characteristics of a slug . ^ worse still : you have a flat-mate with the characteristics of a slug . ^ so ,  ame is slow , leaves slim wherever he goes , and has " uncontrollable mating habits " . ^ whatever ! ! ^ no further comment . ^ well ! ! ! ^  ame of that what you will , but the consequences are perfectly clear to me ! ^ actually , they are not . ^ do you have any ideas ? ^ let me know - quickly , before it 's too late ! ^ - see above . ^ whatever ! ^ the only advise i 'd give is : watch out . ^ he lives next door to you . ^ you may wish to start looking round for special cleaning fluids to remove slim from well-stuck-to-the-floor carpets . ^ you may consider looking up relevant passages in the  ame re : mating habits . ^ you may wish to return the book on stress to him - he might need it . ^ people do say the daftest things when under pressure , confused , or stressed . ^ whatever ! ^ or , on the other hand , you could just not take him seriously , and ask him what he meant by it all ( ! ) . ^ do you have any pictures of characters from  ame  ame /  ame  ame  um ? ^ - i have lots on posters : but they are at  ame . ^ i 'll see what i can find . ^ have you tried searching the internet -  ame sites , film sites . ... whatever . . ... ^ do you have the kind of " picture " that says "  ame  ame  um " yes . ^ i think that the final outcome of my little project in computer-animation land might quite amuse you ! ^ - great ! ^ anyway " whatever " ^ - i like it ! ^  ame did you see any germs around  ame  har ? ^ i did not go into  ame  ame  har , unfortunately , do not possess a transporter that can take me anywhere . ^ i therefore do not have the ability to pass through a  um inch think wooden door . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ you see , i think they will see these holidays as an opportunity to attempt to </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ take over the flat . ^ we shall have to live next term in fully protective biohazard suits . ^ i hope the girls do n't mind being ever so slightly unfashionable - but high strength germ-resistant plastic is coming in , is n't it ? ^ - you 're paranoid . ^ you 're obsessed . ^ you 're a madman . ^ whatever ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ well , there we go . ^ i have been a very busy girly over the past few days . ^ i designed and printed off our annual christmas letter to friends and family . ^ that took ages as i scanned in pictures and made a newspaper type letter thingy . ^ it is really good though . ^ so , did that on thursday . ^ yesterday , me and mam were going to go shopping first thing , but we got a phone call from my uncle  ame to say that my  ame ( dad 's mam ) died in the early morning . ^ she had been in hospital for about  um weeks , and dad had seen her on wednesday when he was down in  ame . ^ he thought she was " on the mend " , but she had a fatal heart attack yesterday . ^ it 's weird . ^  ame i have n't seen her since august , and coz we only see her about once a year as she lived at the other end of the country , it has no impact on my life except to know that she is no longer on this earth . ^ i 'm upset about it , as i loved her a lot , but it is a weird feeling . ^ anyway , we waited in for dad to come back . ^ he did n't come until about  um . ^ mam told him , and he took it ok . ^ he was never amazingly close to his mam , but loved her very much . ^ you see , when dad was  um , his dad died and  ame went into hospital with 'mental " problems . ^ dad 's family were split up and he went to several children 's homes and  ame homes . ^ as a consequence , he 's never seen  ame as a proper mother to him in the way that my mam is to me , and your mam is to you . ^ she 's always been this lady who he called 'mother " , but she was n't a real mother figure to him . ^ do you get what i mean ? ^ well , so , mam went off to work for the afternoon , i went to town to get some bits and  ame we needed , and dad spent the afternoon talking to his brothers and sister on the phone . ^ i wrote all our family christmas cards in the evening - there was nearly  um ! ! ^ ridiculous ! ! ^ then , went to bed , and woke up this moring feeling dodgy . ^ i 'm feeling a bit better now , and might go for a walk to the post office to get rid of our christmas cards . ^ yes , i think i 'll do that . ^ then i 'm going to print out leaflets for the  ame service tomorrow . ^ then i 'm going to make some more cards to sell in the 3rd  ame  ame next term . ^ well , have a nice weekend  ame . ^ not long to go now till i can open my camera ! ! ^ ( the anxiety mounts ! ) bye for now ,  ame get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
