^ &name . 
^ i do n't have interesting days . 
^ here 's what i do . 
^ i get up at &num and go thro the usual morning ablutions for a normal person not obsessed with cleanliness . 
^ then &num or other parent drives me to work and all day i answer phones like this : " good morning / afternoon , the national ( higher tone of voice ) grid company " , with occasional breaks for tea / coffee . 
^ then i go home . 
^ there are bonuses . 
^ today we had a free buffet courtesy of the grid , which was tremendously delish , and they have water coolers , which really are the best thing since sliced bread . 
^ but that 's it . 
^ job , come to &name ...
