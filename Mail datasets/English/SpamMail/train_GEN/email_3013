^ why are we rebellious ? ^ why did  ame take the apple ? ^ because she was tempted by the devil - she wanted to " be like  ame " ( that 's what the serpent tells her will happen if she eats from the tree of knowledge , if i remember rightly ) . ^ we sin then because we want to " be like  ame " - i.e. to be in control , to be masters of our lives , to dominate over the creation . ^ that 's also why the angel  ame gets kicked out of heaven - because he sets himself up to be equal with  ame . ^ i think that 's the only way i can answer that question . ^ why do we do the things that we do ? ^ why do we give into temptation ? ^ why do we choose the wide road instead of the straight and narrow path - because it 's easy ? ^ why did  ame make us " in his image " - i guess it 's all he knew , the only way our love could be valuable to him . ^ we * do * have the ability to choose whether or not to sin -  ame was fully human . ^ he was just the only human ever to know absolutely who was master . ^ the only one to rely on and obey  ame completely , and to resist temptation . ^ we * can * choose not to sin , but  ame knows we never will , that 's why he sent  ame . ^ second question . ^ (  ame - what 's the *  ame * question behind this one ? ^ it usually springs from something deeper ... ) the way *  har * think about this one is that we will care about our loved  um but our loved  um will then be everyone . ^ we 'll no longer " care " because we 'll all be together - loving each other and praising  ame . ^ the  ame does n't say very much about heaven at all , i think that 's because it 's so far beyond our comprehension it would be impossible to explain . ^ one of my favourite descriptions is that we 'll be " in glory " - in  ame 's presence , in perfect joy , singing and dancing with the angels , surrounded by love . ^ i do n't think specific people will be any more important than anybody else - we 've all received the same gift of grace as a passport there . ^ the question is a difficult one to answer because it uses earthly reference points for something which is eternal . ^ in  ame 's eyes we 're all in the " family of  ame " - all _equal_ heirs to the kingdom . ^  ame said " leave your mother and father and follow me " or something to that effect . ^  ame - i 'm so glad you 're having these conversations with the " ladies " . ^ it 's fantastic that you 're able to talk about this stuff and they 're asking you questions - what a great place to start ! ^ i 'd suggest that you always be thinking about what they 're really asking - do you know what i mean ? ^ and also , while we 're here ... did you hear that  ame  ame 's become a christian ? ^ it 's really great , he finally decided that all the things that were in the way before were no longer important and he 'might as well " just choose to follow  ame ! ^ i 'm so glad - everyone 's been praying for him and we 've had a few conversations in which i could tell he was close . ^ he seems really happy and relaxed too . ^  ame ! ^ i really must make a move now . ^ i hope my waffle was in some way helpful - sometimes it 's useful just to have someone kick-start your brain i find ! ^  ame bless ,  ame . ^ love  ame ^  ame in regards to your flat , maybe you ought to talk to  ame . ^ ooops . ^  ame  ame wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^  ame , thanks for your long e-mail . ^ in responce ... they ladies names " are  ame and  ame . ^ what do you mean by the "  ame and  ame " thing ? ^ they have n't broken up have they ? ^ question for you : i was talking to  ame last night about heaven , and she asked " how can  ame damn us for sinning when he made us so that we sin ? ^ is n't that petty ? ^ because we do n't have a choice to sin or not , if we did than there would be someone other that  ame who did n't sin , other wise it shows we have no choice but to sin . " ^ also 'do we care about our loved  um when we are in heaven ? " ^ do you have any thoughts on these ? ^  ame ^ do you  ame ! ? ^ get your  ame address at  ebsite or your  ame address at  ebsite </text_embedded></message_body></message>
