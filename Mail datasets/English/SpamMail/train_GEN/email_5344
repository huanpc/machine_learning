^ some of the answer files contain characters which are n't part of standard &name - this may cause problems with some libraries that you may want to use . 
^ if so , it 's ok to strip the characters out ( we very much doubt it 'll affect any results ) . 
^ &num way of doing this is to use tr ( e.g. immediately after your code unzips the files ) 
^ tr &char " &name -' &num " 
^ will remove all characters above octal &num 
^ &name
