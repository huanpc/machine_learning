^ the places ? ^ the work ? ^ the fun ? ^ it would take many hours and many , many pages to tell you all about it but i 'd still fail . ^ i do n't think i would ever be able to fully share what i saw and experienced there , the task is too huge and complex ( as such things always are ) but i 'll try . ^ our real project or should i say focussed aim was to build a sunday school for a church in  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame , a new and rapidly growing city south east of quito the capitol . ^ we arrived at the church on our first day expecting to find virgin soil just waiting to be dug , but why make it easy when difficult is so much more fun ! ^ the  um ,  um and a half metre square foundation holes could not be dug until the concrete had been cracked through . ^ this was done by bashing with a heavy iron  ame until you got little cracks which then after many hours turn into a hole you can put your hand through . ^ the digging itself could actually be quite fun and it gave me a real sense of achievement knowing that i could hide in my hole if the need ever arose ! ^ however , when the hole got so deep that i had trouble reaching to get the soil out i began to wonder how i was going to get out ! ^ the most sophisticated piece of equipment in  ame is , wait for it' the spade ( the wheel  ame was a close contender but due to its persistent malfunctioning was disqualified ) so we spent many hours of fun pretending to be a cement mixers . ^ it also meant that was had to make all the iron supports-sawing , bending and quilting as we affectionately named it ( twisting wire to join the poles ) . ^ it was while quilting we discussed , debated , argued , sang and most definitely bonded ! ^ despite it being really tough work ,  ame really blessed us on the building site particularly with the relationships with our maestros . ^ he also really protected us- the only accident being a very funny ( although highly embarrassing ) incident when i fell down the well when we were n't building , we tried to get involved with the youth as much as possible , but in all honesty they were so fascinated by the strange gringos that we did n't really have much choice ! ^ each tuesday we ran after school groups for  um year olds , in which we 'd play silly games and do a sketch based around a bible passage which we 'd then get them to learn . ^ the children 's enthusiasm , passion and attentiveness to the verses we asked them to learn , our plays they spontaneously performed for us and most of all  ame was both humbling and hugely encouraging . ^ each day , at  um o' clock on our crawl home from work , children from the local houses would rush out to meet us which prompted us to start a 2nd club held on the street . ^ the most disastrous club we ran may actually turn out to be the most successful . ^ it was our last week , and so taking into account previous weeks we judged that a slightly more challenging and mature approach was needed . ^ however , when  um o' clock came only one of our usual girls was there , so we sat down and prayed as we always did but we also prayed that hoard loads of children from the poor areas [ who the week before we 'd given out clothes to ] that had never been to church before would come . ^ as we finished praying we looked up to see  um children aged between  um and  um flood through the gates . ^ everything we planned went wrong and our impromptu play was a shambles ( due to our lack of spanish we started acting a completely different part of the prodigal son to that which was being read out ! ) . ^ however , in the midst of chaos ,  ame was there controlling and showing his power despite and through our human failings . ^ and that was exactly what is was like all the way through our trip- when our money did n't come through from  ame , our water did n't work in the toilet which although very annoying ( and smelly ! ) at the time meant we did n't have to pay our deposit . ^ the day the toilet was fixed , our money arrived . ^ whenever someone felt a bit ill , prayer restored their health so despite guarantees that we would all get ill at some point  ame bless us amazingly all the time . ^ we felt his presence continually and his hand always guiding us . ^ whenever things were tough or went wrong or we felt discouraged , his spirit was there up lifting us and helping us forward . ^ i want to end by saying my trip was a life changing experience , but was it really ? ^ it should have been , i know that , but how much it actually affects my day to day life now is shamefully questionable . ^  um week , another team member and i gave out tickets to poor families so they could come to the church and collect clothes and toys . ^ the poverty there was so shocking it was practically indescribable . ^  um people living in  um house the size of my ( small ) dining room at home , the only water coming from a stagnant , mosquito breeding stream . ^ and yet despite all this i complain about our cramped flat that is n't big enough to have a party in ! ^  um time when we had a weekend off , we went with the missionary family to the beach . ^  um evening we sat in the town square and ate chicken and chips . ^ we had too much to finish so we found a group of shoe shine boys and gave them our leftover . ^ the look on one of the boy 's faces , i vowed to remember forever , mixture of disbelief and sheer joy that someone would give them food or what we would consider scraps that we did n't want or need . ^ it was so humbling . ^ my time in  ame taught me many things ; perseverance ,  ame , compassion , courage to be challenged but one of the most important things , which i need continual reminding about is how exceptionally blessed we all are in so many ways . ^ it 's not about trying to fit the ecuadorian lifestyle into ours but it is being truly grateful and thankful for what we do have both physically and spiritually . ^ and , most of all giving praise back to the only one who deserves it . </text_normal></message_body></message>
