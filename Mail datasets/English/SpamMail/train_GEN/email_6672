^ this is what every user expects ; but searching is not . 
^ no need to stretch the allready blurred line of how and where you navigate or create your documents . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name ... though you were refering to &name , not kfind .. yes , kfind does not belong here ( at least not in its current state ) 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ its just &num step away from " why ca n't i delete my files using the kfd' -questions .

^ then the fact that the " choose " and the " open " are both closing the dialog suggests they should be placed on the same level . 
^ i.e. next to each other . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i think the wording is too similar to be next to each other ; i 'd wager that many users would not know which one to click . 
^ this means better physical seperation , better wording , or both ... see attached files ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ last ; the user might appreciate feedback on his selection ; page size and comments come to mind here . 
^ ( the tooltip idea &num mentioned before ) .

<text_normal> 

^ agreed ...

^ &name , quick scetch attached that might not be the end-all , but should at the very least prove to solve more problems then most ideas i have seen so far .

^ &char like the direction a lot ... below are &name to a &name file ( so we can play a bit easier &smiley and a snapshot that plays on your idea ... ( i 'm aware of the missalignment of the items in the categories list , that 's to circumvent the default sorting you get when previewing in designer ... ) 
^ &website 
^ in the third pane we could place any additional information desired ... a preview along with kfilemetainfo for a recent document , for instance ... 
^ this makes it a lot like macos &char 's file &name , and that 's a good thing ... 
^ this still leaves the issue of openning an existing file ... i can see think of &num decent solutions ( which probalby means there are at least &num &smiley : 
^ &char ) when the open existing file button is clicked the &num panes are replaced by an embedded &name 
^ &char ) when the open existing file button is clicked the current dialog disappears and is replaced with a stand alone &name . 
^ this would leave us with the quandry of what to do if the user presses cancel in the &name ( probably just treat it as if they pressed &name in the koffice open dialog , but another possibility is to go back to the koffice dialog first ... ) 
^ and just to be a broken record , this should be embedded right in the kword / kspread / kpresenter / etc window and not a stand-alone modal dialog .

^ the way &name are used in all applications is that they provide different views to the same data . 
</text_embedded>

^ certainly not . 
^ do all my konqueror &name show the same data ? 
^ do all my kspread sheets ( &num per &name ) show the same data ?

^ this would still open a modal dialog ( the file dialog ) above the template chooser dialog ( modal too ) - is n't that considered bad practice ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes .. it 's much worse than a modal dialog on a main window ... &num levels of modality should be avoided at all costs ...
