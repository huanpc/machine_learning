^ hi everyone ! 
^ have been told to let you know we are welcome at the &name xmas party , details below . 
^ &name xx 
^ ladies and gentlemen , 
^ by now you should all be aware that the cu athletics club christmas party is taking place at &name on tuesday 3rd december . 
^ the evening will begin at &name , in &name party room . 
^ ( although the main college bar will be open from &num so feel free to come straight down after circuits ! ! ) there will be a free drink on arrival , and the party room bar will be open for the duration of the evening . 
^ there will be copious quantities of mince pies , and other christmas eats to keep you pigged-out ( if you should so wish ) . 
^ theme is " pimps and &name " , so start thinking now for costumes . 
^ there will be plenty of party games like last year , hopefully coordinated by &name again ( although i 'd rather not make another appearance on the &name video camera . . . . . . . ... ) . 
^ cost is &pound; &num per head , and the evening goes on until &num , giving plenty of time for &name 's action afterwards . 
^ if you 'd like a ticket , email me to let me know ( &email ) and get a cheque for &pound; &num payable to cu &name club either into my pigeon hole at &name , or through the door of my house ( &num &name road - the road most of you have to cycle up to get to the track ) &name . 
^ so far i 've had the grand total of &num cheque , from some bloke called &name hall . . . . . . . ... 
^ thanks all ,
