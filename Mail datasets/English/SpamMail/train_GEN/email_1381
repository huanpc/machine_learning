" ^ perhaps the killer had heard about her newfound faith , because he aimed his question-and his gun-right at  ame  ame . ^ the scene was manic . ^ bodies lay strewn around the library , several missing faces and chunks of flesh . ^ screams of agony could be heard in the hallways . ^  ame was headed toward a certain martyrdom . ^ 'do you believe in  ame ? " he screamed . ^ in an instant a strange assurance captivated  ame as she looked into his eyes . ^ " yes , i believe in  ame . " ^ it would be her last words this side of heaven . ^ the price of truth was her life . ^  um thousand years ago  ame looked through prophetic eyes at the world around him . ^ surveying the scene and the trials that would overtake his people , he sought to calm their fears . ^ " blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness , for theirs is the kingdom of heaven . " ^ that  ame was willing to pay such a high price for her faith indicts many of us today . ^ we shrink to tell people about the  ame we serve . ^ yet  ame is ready and willing to empower us to speak a word for him . ^ in the early days of the christian movement many believers lost their lives because they would not renounce their faith . ^ their blood watered the tree of faith from which we now eat . ^ the christian faith is very real , and  ame did not promise us an easy time , but he will be with us all the way . ^  ame can and will use us now , but that involves real sacrifice , and a willingness to serve with all we have in this world . ^ how many of us in our comfortable , western lifestyle are truly willing to give all we have to  ame ? ^ " love the  ame your  ame with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your mind and with all your strength . " ^ " love your neighbour as yourself . " ^ " there is no other commandment greater than these . " </text_normal></message_body></message>
