^ the total cost of the meal was &pound; &num , and that is to be divided between &num . 
^ therefore everyone oews me &pound; &num . 
^ cheques should be made payable to &char &char &name . 
^ i do not take switch as yet ; unfortunately . 
^ &name is also perfectly acceptable . 
^ do not feel required to settle this account until the end of the summer term , when i shall come knocking on your door with &num large bodyguards ( &name and &name ) . 
^ anyway , i think that 's all .
