^ hi- i see you 're up late too &smiley well , i guess it would be easier for me after my exam and deadline , and since you indicated that 's ok with you , could we just arrange something a bit later instead of tomorrow ? 
^ glad you had a good chat with &name this evening , i 'm sure she had lots of helpful things to say &smiley see you sometime after &name then- have a great one ! 
^ love &name

^ erm , perhaps because it 's late , a slight bit of confusion on my behalf ... when you say " after that monday will be a lot easier for me " , do you mean that you 'd rather meet up after that monday , or simply that you have more flexibility in your schedule then ? 
^ assuming the former , then we 'll go with that and arrange something nearer the time . 
^ assuming the latter , tomorrow is fine with me - how about lunchtime to avoid breaking into your lunch hour ? 
^ could easily grab a sandwich and then meet wherever is convinient for you . 
^ &name tomorrow is fine with me however if you 'd rather some other time . 
^ but as i said before , if you want to make it after 27th , that 's absolutely fine . 
^ i had a great chat with &name this evening which certainly helped to clear out my mind somewhat . 
^ see you soon , perhaps tomorrow , 
^ take care , 
^ love

^ hi &name , how are you ? 
^ hope you 're not too stressed either &smiley my work 's getting on ... slowly ... 
^ glad it was good at barnies , yep , &name was good too , thanks . 
^ it would be cool to meet up some time re long term mission work- although i hope you realise i 'm hardly an expert on the subject , having lots of questions about it myself ! 
^ tomorrow seems to be the only possible day for both of us before &name 27th , which i hope to take off although it may depend on whether i 'll be ready to hand in a lit review the next day ... 
^ then any time after that monday will be a lot easier for me- well , as long as it 's not during my exam week ( end of may ) . 
^ i 'll try to check emails again at least by tomorrow morning , so if tomorrow 's best for you then name a time- although we 're having a small bible study / &name for those of us who are around in college in the evening , so during the day would be preferable . 
^ &name that all makes sense ! 
^ if i do n't see you before , i hope you have a great time at &name harvest ! 
^ take care , love &name
