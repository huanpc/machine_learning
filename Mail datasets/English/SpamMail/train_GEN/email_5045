^ hi , 
^ i got the corrected copy from &name in the mail today . 
^ i 'm afraid i 'm not going to get a chance to look at it until thursday , at the earliest . 
^ i ca n't even send it on to &name without looking at it , since the front office staff ( the &num with the fax machine and all the stamps ) decided to take today off . 
^ so , it 's not going to make it there by the 10th . 
^ is that going to be okay ? 
^ &name
