^ ok , for starters , why am &char still the evil one ? 
^ i have done remotely evil for a long time - &char wanted to stab this annoying bastard in my maths lecture with a pencil cuz he would n't stop sneezing but i did n't actually do it so i think &char deserve a new title . 
^ your stariness will do fine . 
^ i have never actually had curry - i 've had bhajii type things b4 but they were too spicy . 
^ i do n't think i would like it cuz of the spiciness and &char hate the smell . 
^ &name . 
^ do n't remember meeting a gymnast . 
^ there was a girl who i think was a classicist with long brown hair 
^ so what are the dates &char gave me ? 
^ just general festivals , or &num greenday will be at ? 
^ the &name advert was on tv . 
^ but i probably wo n't have seen it . 
^ so it does n't matter . 
^ when do &char need to know about graduation day by ? 
^ and how much ar ethe tickets ? 
^ &name i think i 'll be going straight into the fish when i 'm home and i think ( at least to start with ) i 'm going on &num cuz i ca n't face early mornings . 
^ which would be a problem for getting down to &name unless i made up my friday hours earlier in the week - but i know how those evil bastards at macfish are - they might not let me , especially since i;m going to try a book a week or so off for my " holiday to &name with my dad " aka &char in the park . 
^ but we 'll see . 
^ is dad going with anyone like &name or &name ? 
^ &name i would feel bad if i went with mam and he was n't going with anyone . 
^ ok , must dash . 
^ well , do n't really have to but i do n't want to talk to &char anymore ( hee hee) . 
^ no , i have to email &name cuz &char jsut got her new email address today . 
^ had n't heard from her for months ( -ish ) cuz she changed her email address but i did n't know and just thought she was n't speaking to me . 
^ but &name , it 's fine now . 
^ &name luv , &name xx
