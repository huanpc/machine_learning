^ dear everyone 
^ i hope everyone will agree that we should get together over the weekend to discuss our ideas further and make some decisions , if we are to effectively make our deadline on next wednesday , as we do n't have much time left ! 
^ &name and i would like to suggest that we have a couple of meetings : 
^ &name &name ( sunday ) 
^ &name : &num p.m. ? 
^ ( or a convenient time ) . 
^ &name : &name ? 
^ this meeting would be for * everyone * involved with &name &name . 
^ our priority should be discuss what we will need to achieve before next wednesday 's deadline , and how we are going to achieve it . 
^ &name is compiling an agenda for this meeting , and will forward it shortly . 
^ preliminary &name ( &name ) 
^ &name : &num p.m. ? 
^ ( or a convenient time ) . 
^ &name : &name ? 
^ this meeting would be for those of us involved with abstracting the class and interface designs . 
^ i believe this could probably involve &name , &name , &name , but really any of us who would like to contribute to this specific area . 
^ we should aspire to producing a working set of interfaces and packages by the end of the meeting , as we do n't have much time left . 
^ please could everyone reply by email to indicate what times they are available ? 
^ despite the impending deadline , * please * feel free to forget everything this evening and have a good friday night ! 
^ all the best
