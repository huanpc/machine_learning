^ hey , final leg of exams are upon us , which is jolly nice ! 
^ on monday at cu we are going to spend the whole time praising &name for how awesome he is . 
^ the evening will be focused on praising intermojovinated with praying . 
^ it should be a really good refreshing time , where we can focus on &name collectively and make space for the &name &name to move . 
^ take it easy 
^ &name and &name 
^ and this fact is very crazy , an ostrich 's eye is bigger than it 's brain
