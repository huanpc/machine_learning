^ it has proved to be significantly more difficult to get a &name number set-up for this than i imagined . 
^ the simplest solution is : 
^ register with the computer officers to obtain a &name number - fill in a form and then allow an overnight period of time before it is issued . 
^ ( i think ! ) 
^ a job number that should work for this is &num 
^ any problems ( or anyone get the system to work ) please let me know . 
^ &name &name &name , &name &name group &name : ( &num ) &num &num &name university engineering dept. &name : ( &num ) &num &num &name street , &name , &name &name .
