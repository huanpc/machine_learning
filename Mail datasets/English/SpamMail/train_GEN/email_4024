^ dear &name , 
^ thank you so much . 
^ i have a victim to lead the prayers so it would be great if you would read . 
^ the passage for sunday 11th is romans &num : &num . 
^ the usual format is that the person reading steps up as the children are leaving . 
^ if you wait at the lectern until they have disappeared and then announce the reading and the page for the church &name then pause for page-flicking you will get the best attention . 
^ i have no idea how much public speaking you have done so if you are an expert ignore this paragraph ! 
^ the accoustics in &name are not ideal and voices tend to bounce off the lectern straight up to the roof . 
^ you are less likely to suffer from this than those of us who are more vertically challenged but it is worth keeping in mind . 
^ &name slowly and loudly ( pretend we are stupid ) - almost as if you are dragging on because many do not follow in the &name and therefore need to catch every word . 
^ if there is anything else you need to know then just drop me a line . 
^ you do n't need to arrive any ealier than makes you comfortable - i trust you to show up ! 
^ thanks again for doing this and i will see you on sunday , 
^ best wishes
