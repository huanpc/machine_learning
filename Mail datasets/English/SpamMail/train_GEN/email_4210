^ i 'm fully aware that you are in &name ; i am in &name . 
^ &name makes no difference to a willingness to help . 
^ if you do n't want to help me with the arduous task of preparing the phone bill for everyone by checking your bill then i shall just assume , after the others send back their bills , that any unidentified calls were made by you . 
^ i hope this meets with your approval . 
^ your secretary is non-existent . 
^ it would seem most likely that i fulfilled that role over the past year anyway . 
^ do n't worry . 
^ i wo n't bother you again .
