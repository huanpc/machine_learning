^ i 'm completely snowed under with work at the moment , especially as we have a hectic choir weekend - our new organ is being blessed . . . . . ... 
^ so , i ca n't make the prayer meeting on saturday , mainly because we have to sing at a memorial service , but if you could continue to pray for the ticket sales ( which i know you will do anyway ! ) and praise &name for those people who have bought tickets by saturday . 
^ i 'm so sorry that i have to miss another meeting . 
^ also , i wo n't be available to sell tickets at &name . 
^ do you think it will be possible for &name or another member of the admin team who is able to be there to sell them , or should i ask someone in my &name ?
