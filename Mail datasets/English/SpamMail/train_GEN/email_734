^ hi &name , 
^ when you are bored , when you have absolutely nothing to do , when time seems to stand still , i would be grateful if you could add anything to , and correct incorrect details , in this following tale . 
^ &char brief history of the origins and ways of " quon " 
^ &num evening , many many moons ago , when i was sojourning in the room of &name , we began to weave a strange and haunting tale ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ a strange  and haunting tale indeed ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ as i inhaled ( a questionable habit ) copious quantities of &name 's extra strong coffee powder , i happened to mention a particular raven i often saw on the roof outside my room . 
^ on hearing this , &name looked up , slightly startled . 
^ i could tell by the piercing look in his left eye that i had stumbled unwittingly upon something worth finding out . 
^ little did i realise how deep the knowledge he carried within himself would affect our lives . 
^ cough , before proceeding to tell me that the raven was , in fact , a messenger . 
^ i paused and glanced at him questioningly . 
^ the raven , he continued , was reconnoitring this world of ours on direct orders from the &name &name council . 
^ i learned that the bird 's name , translated into our tongue , was " &name " . 
^ this means " bringer of comfortable mattresses " , but that is irrelevant . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ may i interject that if one were to try to pronounce " &name " in the native ravenish tongue , it would sound something close to this : " &name " 
^ this however is quite hard to pronounce and so we shorten it to simply " &name " . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name had journeyed many light years from the planet of &name where war was ravaging his beloved homeland . 
^ he had been instructed by the high council to search for sentient life-forms willing to aid them in their struggle against the vicious , life-sucking " s.n.a.i.l. " sub-species . 
^ that is , &name &name &name &name . 
^ these creatures represent a serious threat to the stability of the &char &name , where the planet of &name exists . 
^ finding himself in the city of &name , away from his home world 's air , he immediately took on the guise of the common " raven " , in character with the rest of his species . 
^ for indeed , whenever they leave the nitrous oxide filled environment of the planet of &name its inhabitants develop a completely new genetic make-up , transforming them into their second form - a common raven . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ second form ? 
^ second effervation i think you 'll find ...

^ once in &name , &name headed for the place most likely to contain sentient life - &name &name 's college . 
^ he had read the university prospectus on his journey through the stars and sought out &num &name &name in particular as his sensors indicated a particularly high concentration of " unusual " neural development there . 
^ &name made his temporary headquarters , or " nest " as the locals called it , in the dense forest canopy to the rear of &name 's. 
^ once base contact had been established he began a swift reconnoitre of the area by air . 
^ suddenly a sharp sensation ran through his head . 
^ then , almost imperceptibly slowly , a voice began to form in his brain , words entered his mind and he found himself listening to and communicating with another life-form . 
^ this being , he soon discovered , was called " &name " and lived at the top of &num &name &name . 
^ as the days went by their knowledge of each other grew and &name became a frequent visitor to &name 's room . 
^ he discovered in this human a mutual understanding of celestial physics and stellar thermodynamics . , not to mention inter-dimensional field theory on which &name himself was a renowned expert . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ indeed , this is how it happened ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ so , that brings me to the part of the tale where &name confided in me the knowledge of the existence of &name . 
^ thereafter , i wished with all my heart to greet this curious emissary face to face . 
^ &name informed me that i should be able to do this the following morning and told me that the phrase " &name " ( i greet the o mighty one ) would be sure to produce an apt response . 
^ indeed , tomorrow morning came , and i did all &name had suggested , additionally performing the universal greeting towards the bird . 
^ this involves lying down on the floor whilst shaking one 's head from side to side &num times then nodding it up and down &num times , during which time it is most proper to say the other being 's name in their native tongue . 
^ as i began to become acquainted with &name language became a bit of a problem . 
^ however , that particular hurdle was soon crossed as &name bestowed my computer with a universal translator , enabling perfect understanding between us to occur . 
^ over the weeks my friendship with this strange ambassador has deepened remarkably . 
^ &num or &num curious incidents have taken place , such as the time when &name 's feathers turned white , giving him the appearance of a magpie . 
^ upon consultation with &name i learned that this was normal behaviour , due to the tri-annual change of gender cycle which &name 's species undergo . 
^ i would not say that our relationship has always been perfect . 
^ indeed , far from it . 
^ &name displays irritable tendencies at times and can become quite angry over relatively trivial misdemeanours , such as when i forget to perform the universal greeting daily towards him . 
^ however , on the whole , he is an absolutely charming fellow , and i hope you have the pleasure of meeting him some day .

<text_normal> 

^ a quite fantastic tale , and one that deserves telling ...
