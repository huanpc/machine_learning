^ &name &name , 
^ i 'm currently in the lab , waiting for a script to run on the computer , and listening to my &name player . 
^ did i tell you , i got &num &char 's on my exams ? 
^ &name is going well , although it 's getting a bit pressured now , as the next couple of games will basically determine whether or not we win the league . 
^ it 's nice being in that position , but it can get a bit out of proportion as well . 
^ yesterday i played hockey ; we won &num , and i scored a glorious individual goal &num minutes from the end ! 
^ it was my first " competitive " hockey goal !

^ &smiley &name . 
^ &name the exam went well - i guess the lack of nerves is basically a good thing . 
^ after all , there is more to life ! 
^ i was invited to a wedding over the phone yesterday . 
^ a friend from home is getting married , and i spent quite a bit of time with her before she started going out with her boyfriend ( soon to be husband ! ) . 
^ should be good . 
^ are you thinking much about your wedding ? 
^ how does it all feel ?

^ have you managed to play any more ?

^ i played in my college bar the other night actually . 
^ i did a few duet numbers with a friend , and actually we usually sound really good , but unfortunately the only sound system they could rig up was a single amplifier ! 
^ so , the vocals sounded really bad , and having &num things coming out of the &num amp was not at all great ! 
^ i hate using inappropriate equipment , so that was a little depressing . 
^ still , at least i got a chance to play . 
^ i 'd love to do some stuff properly , but it 's hard to find time and other people who want to do the same thing . 
^ i quite envy your opportunities actually ! 
^ i 've written some stuff i 'm quite pleased with recently though . 
^ i 've been thinking about buying some equipment for my laptop so i can get back into recording again . 
^ only problem is ( apart from the cost ! ) i 'm not sure whether my laptop is really fast enough for the job , and i certainly do n't have enough money to buy a new laptop ! 
^ we 'll see ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i know that you can appreciate how long it takes to record &num songs from scratch ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ lots of work , but potentially a great feeling if they sound good . 
^ that 's why i want to get back into recording : &char ) . 
^ let me know when you 're likely to be touring this part of the country wo n't you ! 
^ speak soon ,
