^ &name : 
^ hope you have a very happy birthday tomorrow . 
^ i do n't know if my card will get there in time as i only got your address from your dad last monday . 
^ at this time of the year the post is quite slow . 
^ i instructed your dad to give you money from &name and i for your birthday as i 'm not to keen in putting it in with the card . 
^ some things i sent to &name went astray . 
^ i also sent you an electronic card just in case the real one does n't get there in time . 
^ &name got a big surprise yesterday , he was able to listen to a live report from the &name park on the &name / &name game on &name through the &name . 
^ he 's just amazed at the technology . 
^ i got to listen to the dons while i was sending an e-mail to your dad . 
^ have been having a few problems with the pc freezing up , so i may have to take it back to the shop but i 'm going to try to hang on till after christmas . 
^ i 've got to go out shortly so i had better go and get ready . 
^ will give you a phone call sometime soon . 
^ hope you enjoy your new job and have a great birthday .
