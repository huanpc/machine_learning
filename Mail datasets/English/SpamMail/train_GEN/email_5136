^ first announcement and call for papers 
^ &name university will host the fifth international workshop on computational semantics ( iwcs-5 ) , which will take place from &num january &num . 
^ the aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers interested in any aspects of the computation of meaning in natural language , in language-based multimedia objects , or in multimodal messages . 
^ topics of interest 
^ topics of interest for the workshop will be computational aspects of semantic theories and theoretical issues in building natural language understanding systems . 
^ papers are invited in areas which include , but are not limited to , the following : 
^ * construction and use of natural language semantic 
^ * knowledge representation and reasoning in meaning computation 
^ * learning lexical semantics from corpora 
^ * meaning representation in multimodal interaction 
^ * the semantic web , ontologies and natural language semantics 
^ * meaning in multimedia objects 
^ * the computational interface 
^ * modelling and using context for semantic 
^ * computational semantics of speech acts 
^ * logic and use of underspecified of meaning 
^ * monotonicity and shallow reasoning in 
^ * dynamic interpretation in text , speech and dialogue 
^ * inductive logic programming and computational semantics 
^ * semantic aspects of language generation 
^ * shallow processing and formal semantics 
^ invited speakers to be announced

^ submission requirements 
^ submission of full papers authors are asked to submit an original paper of maximally &num pages by september &num , &num . 
^ files should be prepared with latex and initial submissions should be in postscript format . 
^ ( for accepted papers we will need the latex source code to prepare the proceedings . ) the page limit presupposes the standard &num point computer modern font and default latex formatting . 
^ all papers will be refereed by the programme committee . 
^ we aim at publishing a selection of accepted papers in book form after the workshop . 
^ email your postscript file to : &email 
^ there are &num levels of acceptance : 
^ - acceptance for a long ( &num min . ) presentation . 
^ the full paper will be published in the proceedings , available at the time of the workshop . 
^ - acceptance for a flash ( &num min . ) presentation in a plenary session plus presentation of a poster in one of the poster sessions . 
^ authors will be invited to publish a 3-page abstract in the proceedings . 
^ submission of poster abstracts it is also possible to directly submit a 3-page abstract for a flash presentation and a poster session . 
^ the abstract should be prepared with &name ( &num point computer modern , default formatting ) . 
^ email to &email the resulting postscript file by &num november &num . 
^ further guidelines since we will use the latex source code of accepted papers and poster abstracts for producing the proceedings , please follow the further guidelines for submission at the iwcs-5 website :
