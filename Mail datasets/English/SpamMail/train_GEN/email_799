^ &name , 
^ hi . 
^ the &name code yes , i think it is a hoax probably . 
^ i do n't know an awful lot about it , and i probably think there are significant number patterns in the &name , but i do n't think i like the idea of using word patterns etc. to tell the future . 
^ why do you ask ? 
^ i think you are investigating it . 
^ do you understand the computer-based side ? 
^ i do n't know how much my brother is willing to spend on a guitar - probably a lot if i know him . 
^ what do you mean by " what 's your problem " ? 
^ out of interest , could you tell me your guitar 's model number and details ? 
^ &name seems to think you 're giving it to him . 
^ that 's awfully kind of you &name . 
^ i do n't do caber-tossing . 
^ i do surface chemistry ( at least that 's my aim for today ) . 
^ this afternoon i intend to help my mum paint the bathroom ceiling before going into &name to buy some mother 's day gifts . 
^ i do hope &name gets better soon . 
^ have you got &name &name &name yet ? 
^ incidentally , your storage heater was on , but i 've switched it off now . 
^ &name this is a short e-mail , surface chemistry is calling - faintly . 
^ " till you reply , 
^ &name
