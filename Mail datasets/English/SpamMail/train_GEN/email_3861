^ hey &name , 
^ try this site : &website / 
^ i ca n't really recommend any particular piece of software ( not that 's free anyway ! ) but have a look at the multi-track recorders here - there should be something that will do what you 're looking for . 
^ make sure you get a complete shareware / freeware program and not just an update . 
^ see you soon ,
