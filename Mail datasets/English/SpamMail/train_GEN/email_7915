^ when i was too drunk to bloody notice and they 're just too disgusting . 
^ but dad has n't noticed and i 'm not telling him or mam cuz my ass would be grass . 
^ it was absolutely pishing down on the saturday but you did n't really notice being too wet until you were back in the tent . 
^ but the place was a dubby mes &char the whole weekend and you just could n't get clean . 
^ it was roasting at times on the sunday which was nice for a change . 
^ &name was there but he did n't grace us with his presence too often . 
^ but he &name &char show us his fake fur coat he got for &pound; &num . 
^ he 's quite chuffed with it . 
^ &name was on stage with wheatus along with heaps of other people during &name dirtbag so he 's on tv and is quite proud of himself . 
^ on the way home 
^ we stopped at the service station just outside the place so he ran god knows 
^ how far to buy wine from a nearby &name . 
^ so he drank that &num litres and cider and stuff so he was pissed to the eyeballs when we got home .

^ they did n't even speak to me about skiving but they 've been speaking to other people so they 're maybe just making me sweat . 
^ but we had a meeting today saying how last week 's performance was shit so they 're going to start sacking people if they do n't pull thier weight . 
^ so they were counting our boards on line &num but i was knackered so my first percentage was &num .
