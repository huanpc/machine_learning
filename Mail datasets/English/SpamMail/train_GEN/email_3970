^ &name , 
^ yes , we look forward to your visit ! 
^ ... and you 're certainly welcome to stay longer if you need to shorten your stay at &name 's for any reason . 
^ do you need a ride from the airport on the 12th - or has &name taken care of that ? 
^ &name exams went well for you ( assuming these are over now ? ) . 
^ i sure enjoyed my visit with &name and your parents ! 
^ &num highlight was canoeing up the river &name on an incredibly warm and pleasant afternoon after watching the &name cup final . 
^ am told the best guide on the river was not in town however - he was apparently busy pondering the origins of rocks in another part of the country .
