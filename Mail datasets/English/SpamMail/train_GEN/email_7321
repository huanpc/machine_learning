^ hi &name , 
^ i 'll put you on the list . 
^ time committment is whatever you want . 
^ we 'll usually train once during the week and have matches on saturdays . 
^ the playing policy is that everyone will get a shot to play if they show up for a match . 
^ but people who are regulars are more likely to get regular playing time ...
