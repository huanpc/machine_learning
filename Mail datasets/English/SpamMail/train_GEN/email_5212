^ hi , 
^ well , this is really to avoid confusion . 
^ &name has nothing to do with th is , the booking of &name was done last year by someone who is not even in a basketball team anymore . 
^ apparently , the booking was made and no one else was informed , so literally no one knew anything before the beginning of &char his week when i got the &name invoice . 
^ i called to &name already and they do n't hav &char any regular slot free ( they have random hours even more weird than those in the invoice ) . 
^ the timetable might have changed on the base of complaints / non-avaibility of the court , honestly , i have no clue ...

^ i think moving the games to a friday afternoon , is probably a bad idea . 
^ if others feel this way , we should write to leonor , to get the matches changed back to a weekend ,

^ hi girls ... 
^ i have just received this ... &num had told me till now , but apparen tly ppl had complained about playing on sundays and these are the slots &char hat have been booked . 
^ same number of hours so in thoery just shift the timetable &char gave you . 
^ first game on friday 17th at &num : &num , 2nd on 23rd at 
^ 15: &num , then 3rd same day at &num : &num etc. 
^ i am personally not happy with this seems a bit chaotic to me ... but perhaps if ppl complained about sundays they prefer these times . 
^ not sure about other teams but i know this will pose a problem for my team , mi ght not be easy to get players for these times . 
^ also remember about the refereeing . 
^ so , if any captain thinks this will pose a big problem for their team let me know &name ( as in before friday ) . 
^ do n't think there is much i can &char &char , but it would be good to know if teams or referees just are n't going &char &char show up . 
^ sorry for the short notice but &char literally got it &num mins ago . 
^ &name 
^ friday 17th january from &num : &num to &num : &num &num 
^ thursday 23rd january from &num : &num to &num : &num &num
