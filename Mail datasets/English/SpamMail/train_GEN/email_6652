^ please forward liberally . 
^ i have now been about &num months in &name and am slowly forgetting how to speak ingles so you will have to excuse my grammatical errors . 
^ i am here working for a christian charity called &name who work with 'marginalised people " - including drug addicts , alcoholics , people with &name and sexually abused people . 
^ the centre that i am working in is called punto &name encuentro ( trans meeting point ) and is a less intensive centre only for adolescents ( almost all of the teenagers here have been through the more intesive rehabilitation of the main &name houses ) . 
^ a number of us live together in tw houses , one for the boys and one for the girls ( i live in the boys " house ) . 
^ during the days , we all go to work . 
^ we do work in a book warehouse , delivering mattresses , working in a second hand clothes shop ( which we recently opened ) and shaking tins on the street ( although this seems to have stopped since the clothes shop has opened ) . 
^ &name gets food second hand from supermarkets ( ie stuff that is out of date ) this ensures that running costs stay low . 
^ as well as workiing during the day , all of the residents here have to help with household chores and cooking and cleaning . 
^ the charity is closely linked to the church ( 'resurection church " ) and all of the residents are christians . 
^ we meet on saturday mornings to pray , saturday evenings to read the &name and praise &name and also the girls and boys have a separate meeting during the week . 
^ the church meets on sunday evenings and also there is a 'ministry school " going on at the moment which is lots of teaching from the &name about once a month . 
^ every person who is being rehabilitated her will say that &name has changed their life and it is a privalage to see this happening . 
^ when i arrived there were &num boys and &num girls living in residence and now there are &num boys and &num girls ( i did n't drive them away ! ) . 
^ in the &num years that the charity has been running there has been over &num people in puto &name encuentro . 
^ i came with very little spanish and now i can understand most dirrections . 
^ i understood my first sermon without the aid of translation yesterday ( although i did have a dictionary in hand ) . 
^ a sermon is a good way to start understanding converstaional spanish because the preacher is speaking slowly and clearly ( well , most of them ) . 
^ in other meetings , an english lady called &name and a girl from &name called &name have been very kind in translating sermons for me . 
^ i have bought a cheap cello here and enjoy practicing when i have the time - definately an emotional outlet ( where language is n't) . 
^ i play the keyboard in church meetings on sundays which is good because i do n't understand most of the songs anyway . 
^ one of the boys started to learn the cello with me when i came but there has n't been time to teach them any more ( and they have n't been persistant in asking me , so i let it drop ) . 
^ spanish people certainly conform somewhat to stereotypes ( some found in certain french operas ! ) . 
^ they do like dancing a lot , making a lot of noise , drinking wine , many people called &name ( although no &name ! ) and they take siestas- well some of them do . 
^ i have eaten lots of strange meet aswell . 
^ heart is ok - a bit like liver but more moist , there is some meat on head that is good but most of it is ugh and ostrich steak is gorgeous ! 
^ at the moment i am thinking of staying out here for a year or so . 
^ there are many things that i miss about &name like the language , fresh food and peace and quiet . 
^ i am considering coming back for a week or &num once i have been here about &num months . 
^ it would be really good to see many of you . 
^ at the moment i am happy here ! 
^ love to all , &name
