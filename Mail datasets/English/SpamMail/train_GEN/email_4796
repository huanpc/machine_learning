^ i 'm highly disappointed that you were unable to sign my guestbook . 
^ i expect it will be the first place you go next time a witticism enters your mind &smiley 
^ i have exams on the 23rd so it probably is n't an ideal time for you to come up , because i have left so many little chores left to do for after my exams . 
^ but if you wanted to come up in the evening and help cook the last &name dinner you would be more than welcome &smiley but it does n't really make sense if you have to go back on the 24th anyway ... you would n't be able to go for a punt . 
^ i doubt i could spend more than a couple of days in &name before coming back to &name ... i 'm not sure what my obligations here will be yet . 
^ perhaps is makes sense for you to come back to &name when i do ? 
^ as far as the 27th or 28th ... that 's really your call . 
^ the longer you are here the better in my mind ... but i do n't want to keep you from your family . 
^ wait ... i just remembered ... it looks like i will be coming out of retirement on wednesday night for &num final &name game . 
^ i do n't know if that is added incentive or not for you to come ... and the game still might not happen . 
^ anyway , i better get back to studying ...

^ hey &name , 
^ so i was this close to signing your guest book . 
^ the screen was open . 
^ i had even begun to write a message when &char closed the screen and squealed with fear . 
^ i am not feeling clever enough presently . 
^ i think i 'm afraid of your guestbook . 
^ just wanted to let you know that i tried . 
^ ; &char next time . 
^ when &char return with more strength and courage . 
^ i hope studying is going well and you are not being too distracted . 
^ went to &name yesterday and &name . 
^ was very cool . 
^ i 'm still trying to figure out whether or not to leave on the 27th or 28th . 
^ this is where i need your help ... do n't think about it too hard but what would your game plan be after the tests are over ... i may have to be in &name on the 24th from 4-9pm helping &name with auditions . 
^ but besides that i 'm a free gal . 
^ should i come to &name on the 23rd ? 
^ when you come back to &name , would you stay until i leave ? 
^ ( that would be &num days i think depending on when i leave . ) or do you have to get back . 
^ i 'd love to spend the time with you but do not feel pressured if you have work to do . 
^ hmm . 
^ yeah , do n't rack your brain about this now but could you give me a rough idea so i know what 's happening ... 
^ oh &name ! ! 
^ one more thing ... so &char talked to &name the other night ( older broseph ) he told me that &name &name was mad hitting on him and they actually were dating very briefly , meaning they made out and stuff a few times . 
^ he said that she was too skinny and seemed very insecure and it creeped him out so he broke it off with her . 
^ found this interesting because it 's such a small world . 
^ alrighties- good reading wishes , &name
