^ i 'm getting better but i 'm going to &name on saturday - i 'm not sure i will be able to email the paper from there . 
^ i 'm back on the 18th , so i could definitely get you a longer paper by the 20th , but i expect that would be too late ? 
^ maybe i could send you a short paper tomorrow , and then send you something longer if i can do so from &name ? 
^ then you can use the longer version if it arrives in time , but if not , you 'll still have something ? 
^ best ,
