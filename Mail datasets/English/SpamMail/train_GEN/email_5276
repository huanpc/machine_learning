^ &name , welcome to council . 
^ you should now be on the &email and &email email lists . 
^ that is you should receive email sent to either of these addresses , and you should be able to send to them . 
^ council-private is strictly council members only , which is occasionally useful . 
^ council-discussion is the list we use to discuss most things . 
^ it is council ( &name &name , &char &name &name , me , &name &name , &name &name , you , &name &name and &name &name ) plus some other people , roughly , the people who are responsible for communication ( &name &name - journal editor , &name &name - membership secretary , &name &name - newsletter editor , &name &name - publicity , &name &name - webmaster , &name &name - youth newsletter ) . 
^ as you start receiving messages on these &num lists , you should rapidly get the hang of it . 
^ also , email sent to the address &email should get forwarded to &email this may not be terribly useful , but still .
