^ dear &name 
^ thank you for sorting that out - i 'll return it , of course . 
^ &num thing - i 'm going to have to make markings in it for the performance - it 's standard practice to do so , and makes conducting it much easier . 
^ i 'll keep things neat and tidy , but it would be good to have your permission before i write in it . 
^ if you prefer , i 'm quite happy to purchase the score from you , and keep it after the concert - it depends whether you think it 'll be any use to you after 11th feb. i would regard this as a suitable contribution towards the performance , and it would be great to have the score in the future . 
^ i mentioned this to &name , but he did n't say anything about it . 
^ if you 'd rather keep it , then that 's fine , of course ; it 's a lovely thing to have . 
^ thanks
