^ hey &name , 
^ sorry to have missed you online today ... we both seem to have quite busy schedules ! 
^ anyway , i do n't know if you tried to email me or not , but my &name account had some problems today with not receiving emails because i went over my &name file-size limit . 
^ anyway , if you did try to send me pictures or whatever , i did n't receive them ... this account ( my &name &name account ) has no such limit so there should n't be any problems . 
^ &name
