^ dear everyone 
^ i believe &name has tagged the repository yesterday evening , and copied our project to the &name . 
^ however , a number of bugs have been fixed in the last &num hours ( &num a.m. - &num a.m. ) , from &name and myself , which means this version on the &name is already out of date ! 
^ &name - or anyone who feels capable - if you are reading this , please could you copy the latest tagged version ( pwf-version-final ) to the &name , before the &num noon deadline . 
^ i have taken the precaution of not doing this myself since it is very late at night and i do not want to make a mistake due to lack of concentration . 
^ on a positive note , a &name for the &name has been finished . 
^ hopefully , it should work seamlessly with the &name itself . 
^ &website ( to be found in /source / &name / ) from a command prompt . 
^ i hope that people like the result - it is very important that we can show our distribution system in the best possible light at the group demonstration . 
^ &name , the &name for the client has been overhauled , according to suggestions from people that not enough information was being displayed to the user . 
^ i hope that people find the result is more colourful and informative . 
^ to this this , go to &website . 
^ finally ( ! ) , i started a factorisation running at &num : &num a.m. , with the purpose of leaving this running for as long as possible . 
^ it is currently attempting to factorise a number with the following lengths of primes : &num &num &num &num &num &num &num . 
^ please feel free to contribute to this factorisation - fire up a client , again at &website . 
^ let 's hope that nothing crashes - fingers crossed . 
^ that 's all for now - hope to see everyone on monday afternoon &smiley 
^ all the best 
^ - &name 
^ ... zzz ...
