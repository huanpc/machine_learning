 um ,  um per annum . ^ under the advice of one of my potential supervisors , dr.  ame  ame , i am seeking sponsorship for this postgraduate degree . ^ as a mining company with a vested interest in the development of the geological sciences , in particular , exploration techniques , i felt it appropriate to approach you about sponsorship for this project . ^ it is my hope that you will consider helping me to fund this study , either in part or in full . ^ i attach a short synopsis of the proposed phd , prepared by  ame  ame ,  ame and  ame of the university of  ame and an approximate breakdown of costs . ^ i also attach my resume . ^ thank you for considering this application and i eagerly await your reply . ^ yours truly , ^  ame  ame  ame ^ - ----a short synopsis of the proposed phd project.----- ^ the intrusion architecture of the whin sill complex : digital acquisition and modelling ^ digital mapping technologies provide the potential to automatically capture , visualize and model the  um geometry of structures such as basins , intrusions , and fault zones . ^ new methodologies that best combine  ame ,  ame  ame ,  ame data management systems and visualisation software are now urgently required . ^ in conjunction with the  ame (  ame  ame  ame ) and  ame ( system for integrated geospatial mapping ) projects at  ame , the aim of this project will be to develop methodologies of collecting spatially constrained geological information in the field and producing  um models from the data . ^ this provides the opportunity to test a range of new technologies on a specific geological problem , including data collection , data processing ,  um geological model construction and data management . ^ the student will use  ame ,  ame and  ame  ame location methods to map intrusions of the whin sill complex , to cm-scale accuracy , collating spatial co-ordinates on a palm-top computer whilst traversing along or across the exposed igneous bodies . ^ the data will be incorporated onto a digital  um topographic map and aerial photograph database using industry standard  ame for data management in a  ame format . ^ structural attributes observed at individual localities will be collected and stored in digital format , including contact type and orientation data , linkage features displayed , intrusion-rock type and country rock structural and contact metamorphic features . ^ detailed digital outcrop maps will capture the detailed  um relationships and will be supplemented by digital photographs on which mm-scale features can be digitised with all data ( topographic , remotely sensed images and structural measurements ) . ^ the student will then use  ame software for  um visualization of the  ame data layers to provide a basis for creating a model of the intrusion network . ^ additional constraints on the  um architecture from geophysical datasets will be incorporated as appropriate . ^ factors determining the final emplacement of high-level dykes , sills and laccoliths are complex , and depend upon a range of physical parameters including magma driving pressure , the local ( and regional ) stress field , and the physical properties ( viscosity and density ) of the intruding magma . ^ despite their wide occurrence and structural importance in basin architecture , their  um geometry is not well understood . ^ the development of a digital model will allow the reconstruction of the emplacement history through time as well as an assessment of the effects of intrusion of a major sill complex on basin evolution and architecture . ^ the student will be part of the  um modelling group at  ame . ^ this includes the  ame research group (  ame  ame and  ame ) , a well-established group of  ame and post-doctoral researchers studying the geological and rheological aspects of faults and shear zones , and the magmatic modelling group ( dr.  ame ) , concerned with the influence of igneous rocks on sedimentary basins . ^ they will receive training in state of the art digital mapping and data management techniques together with field-based mapping . ^ this training will be relevant to a broad range of future careers in the earth sciences . ^ related ongoing  ame projects include :  um )  ame link project on quantifying fault zone evolution and basement reactivation ;  um )  ame - an  ame 5th framework initiative on sub-basalt imaging . ^  um ) modelling of sill and laccolith intrusions . ^  um ) inversion study of  ame basin . ^ supervisors : dr  ame  ame , dr  ame  ame , dr  ame  ame , ^ - ----an approximate breakdown of the costs for this phd project----- ^ costs per annum ^  ame  ame :  ound;
