^ i was in the middle of writing that email to &name that started out as : 
^ " hi &name , 
^ i met with &name earlier today to discuss the stream id matter that we were talking about . 
^ he convinced me they were necessary in order to distiguish input simple streams if the user wants to perform calculations on them directly . 
^ for example , if a query was to calculate the average heartbeat for every soldier whose data was flowing through the system of schema ( &name , heartbeat ) then without &name , there would be no way to distinguish heartbeats of different soldiers ... " 
^ but then i remembered that we just said that we would keep around the information that is used to created the &name ( sensor id , sensor type , etc ) so that brings me back the the original question - why ca n't the aggragate boxes group these attributes into an &name rather than do it at the beginning of the system ?
