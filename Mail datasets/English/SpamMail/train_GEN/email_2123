(  ame story ) . . ... the end - or just the beginning ? ^ - make it the end . ^ you know what i think about  ame stories . ^ i refer to  ame 's not-so-amusing " trick " . ^ you ( and possibly the rest of the world - except  ame , who understands me ) probably wo n't understand when i say that , even though i forgave  ame ages ago , it still hurts . ^  ame . . . . ... possibly some bitterness there . ^ not good . ^ have to try and get rid of that . ^  ame ot hear of  ame again though . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^  ame : howcome a till is an inannimate object , but "  ame " is treated as an individual ? ^ bit of discrimination there i think . ^ bye - have fun ,  ame ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
