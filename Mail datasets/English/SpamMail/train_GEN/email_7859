^ hi &name 
^ i 'll be in. .. but i 'll be in &name 's flat . 
^ did n't dad point that bit out ? 
^ i 'm staying there on sunday to be ready for my interview on monday . 
^ he told me last night so &name be phoning you there . 
^ hope you know about pasting scanned files into word documents without leaving a big white space after the picture cause i may be needing your advice for my thesis . 
^ its got to be in next friday . 
^ yes , he told me first , ha ha ... &smiley 
^ &name im so mad . 
^ give me a break 
^ yes , dad said it had to be in &name he was scanning some diagrams out of textbooks for you or something . 
^ i have n't &num fnished my project yet , but the end is int sight . 
^ well .. the end of the practical stuff anyway . 
^ hopefully , i should be starting my dissertation anytime now , and then depending on how that goes i might do some more practical stuff at the same time . 
^ but i also need to revise at some point this holiday ... there just are n't enough hours in a day . 
^ &smiley 
^ &name started some revision . 
^ i think the cv thing motivated me to do some work so im taking advantage of that . 
^ its not real revision , its reading textbooks and taking notes but it saves me doing it later and &name understand it better if &name seen it before . 
^ i have &num exams so thats a lot of work . 
^ i could have them a day after each other ! 
^ we cant be guaranteed a day between each . 
^ yesterday was the last day of lectures , but i don;t do the courses on thatday , so i spent the whole day basically working on my project and got a fair bit done . 
^ but it 's a bit boring so i took a break after lunch and decided to clear out my email account since i was getting dangerously close to my &name and keep getting warnings . 
^ so i pasted all the email jokes and stupid forwards that everyone 's ever sent me into a coupleof huge word documents so i could delete all them ... i had bloody hundreds of the thigs : it took me hours ! 
^ but nevere mind . 
^ i 'm down to just over half my &name now . 
^ which i do n't actually understand , since i assumed most of the space would be taken up by forwards . 
^ never mind . 
^ i 'm sure you 're not interested . 
^ i still have lectures nedxt week , then its the holidays . 
^ i have &num ( instead of &num ) a week for &num weeks after that . 
^ &name doubled up the lectures so we have &num complete reading weeks . 
^ only problem is that i wont be able to go to the extra lectures cause theyre at &num and i work at half past . 
^ &name get notes from my pals though . 
^ as for the emails , you should sort them out as you get them . 
^ my hotmail &name is shit but the only way you can expand it is if you pay them money . 
^ &name that ! 
^ on mondays , its often disabled cause i have too much forwarded shit from over the weekend as i dont check it at home . 
^ anyway , the reason i told dad to tell you to phone me is just so we can sort out what 's happening when you come down to &name e.g. whether i 'm coming to meet you when you on your way away to &name or on your way home , &name i 'm not sure i can spare the time to stay in &name for both . 
^ we 'll see . 
^ it depends how far i 've got with my work by then . 
^ but at least if i speak to you about it we can get it sorted out once and for all . 
^ i didnt expect you to be in &name for it all . 
^ ill phone sunday night , probably earlier on cause the full &name is on at &num 
^ &name .. this is quite a long email . 
^ &name . 
^ i 'm waiting for my project supervisor to reply to my email asking if i could have my supervision as soon as i get to the lab , since i 'm sure we were supposed to be having one at about &num anyway . 
^ but he has n't replied yet . 
^ so i 'm thinking he might not be in the lab . 
^ which is a bit of an arse really , as me and &name have just walked out to the lab from &name hall . 
^ and have to walk all the way back into town again so he can have his yearbook photo taken . 
^ &name . 
^ and i have a &name meeting today . 
^ fun fun . 
^ i get to hear what all my supervisors have been saying about me . 
^ &name &name and do you have to get a yearbook photo taken as well ? 
^ we got a year photo taken but i havent heard anything about ordering them yet . 
^ i voted for the one i liked best but thats the last i heard . 
^ hope your interview for on monday ? 
^ i mean what kind of job and what company and where would you be working at ? 
^ are you still thinking about post grad ? 
^ i phoned the wifey dad told me to about being put on the classroom auxiliaries register . 
^ i have to fill in a form which she is sending to me . 
^ i thought that would be it but i have to get an interview and she doent know when the next set of interviews will be . 
^ she hopes there will be some before the summer holidays . 
^ thats pretty shit cause &name seemed keen but they cant approach me till im on the register and they might fill the post if im not quick enough . 
^ speak to you later cause im off home to do my final thesis corrections 
^ lots of love , &name xx
