^ why should i get the choice between a4 / legal / letter size of paper ? 
^ in &name , you ca n't buy in a shop legal size paper only &name and i guess in &name &name it is the opposite . 
^ you should be able to change the size of the paper in a option dialog ( you do it once in a while ) or with a wizard but not in a startup dialog where if you fumble and press by mistake the wrong size you 'll finish with strange problems when you start printing .

^ i can think of a couple of counter points ... each category should remember the last selected item , so you should n't have to fumble more than once . 
^ alternatively , we could offer paper size as an option in the third panel . 
^ &char ut this would be an annoyance for most , and simply removing the size picking makes it unclear for first timers and annoying for travellers . ... * shrug *

^ &char ) when the open existing file button is clicked the current dialog disappears and is replaced with a stand alone &name . 
^ this would leave us with the quandry of what to do if the user presses cancel in the &name ( probably just treat it as if they pressed &name in the koffice open dialog , but another possibility is to go back to the koffice dialog first ... )

^ i think it is the best solution . 
^ the user will understand than pressing &char he " open existing file " is the same action than doing file--)open . 
^ the same action should bring the same widget .

<text_normal> 

^ makes sense ... what do you think about embedding the new open widget right 
^ inside the main window ?
