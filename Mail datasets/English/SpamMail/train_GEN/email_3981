^ hey &name - i seem to be hearing the same story from lots of people right now - you 're not alone ! 
^ i know it 's really hard not to worry - especially when you really want something and you 're not sure whether &name wants the same thing for you ( is that about right ? ) . 
^ i find that hard too sometimes . 
^ i guess i always have to force myself to remember that if &name has different plans for me then they 're always going to be far better plans ! 
^ &name , i do n't know if it helps , but i have great confidence in you and i trust you a lot . 
^ you 're going to do some great things and if he wants you to stay in &name then he 'll sort out somewhere to live and everything else ! 
^ i 'll write more in a minute - experiment awaits ,

^ hi &name , 
^ to follow on from my text message ... i 'm finding that combined with all the normal tirings of college i do n't know that i fully trust that &name is in control ofd my life . 
^ at least i do n't feel confident enough just to give everything to him and not worry about it all . 
^ so if i sigh , it is probably that i am still worried about whether i 'll get my phd or not , and then whether i 'll get a house or not , and then i wonder about how permanent &name and i will be - standard worries , but they do get to me . 
^ i would appreciate your prayers . 
^ thanks for being such a great and supportive friend . 
^ lots of love , &name &name &name &name 
^ st. &name 's college 
^ &num &name &name &name &name &name 
^ department of geological sciences university of &name 
^ mobile ( vodaphone ) &num &num &num &num
