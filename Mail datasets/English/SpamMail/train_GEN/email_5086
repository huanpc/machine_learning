^ if the locks on the doors permit ! 
^ but i must admit that i do so with some trepidation because 
^ &num . 
^ the new library furniture has not arrived ( there are a few old chairs and tables , but not a lot of comfort ) ; 
^ &num ) magazine rack has not arrived ( recent magazines are displayed on a table to your left as you enter the library ) ; 
^ &num ) there is no photocopier yet in the library ( although it was ordered about &num weeks ago . 
^ advanced warning : it will be coin or card operated - more on that when the machine does arrive ) ; 
^ &num ) my so-called office space is in a jumble ( the office furniture may not arrive for &num weeks ) , and i feel rather unsettled . 
^ however , the books are on their shelves and the periodicals on theirs ( although within title the sequence may be somewhat jumbled ) . 
^ also the bar coding system is up and running thanks to &name &name , so please feel free to borrow books . 
^ should there be a problem with the system , please contact &name . 
^ please do not take a book out without bar coding it . 
^ please remember that periodicals are not to leave the library . 
^ i am here on monday , then away on tuesday , but back on wednesday . 
^ and then starting on 9th september i am on holiday for &num weeks . 
^ i certainly hope that before i leave , the photocopier will be in place . 
^ ( i have rung the company representative twice and left messages on his answering machine but he has not got back to me . ) 
^ &num other thing : the mobile shelves which house the archives are out of bounds for safety and security reasons . 
^ if you need old material , please ask me . 
^ indeed please ask me about anything in the library . 
^ there are bound to be some inconveniences which i am sure we can resolve but &name please is required . 
^ so , see you in the new library ! 
^ &name
