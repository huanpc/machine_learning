^ extraordinary general meeting 
^ an extraordinary general &name of &name university musical society will be held in the &name hall of the university music school at &num p.m. on tuesday &num january &num . 
^ the principal business of the &name will be to vote on a new constitution for the society , to replace the existing one which has been in place since &num . 
^ copies of the existing constitution , and of the proposed new constitution , together with a summary of the principal changes , will be displayed on the society 's notice board from &num january &num ; individual members may also obtain copies by applying to the treasurer , prof. &name &name , at &name &name 's college . 
^ if the new &name is approved , the &name will also include elections to the executive offices of the society ( secretary , treasurer , publicity secretary , &name , instrument manager and &name ) under the terms of the new &name . 
^ it is expected that the existing holders of these posts will be nominated by the committee ; but members are entitled to nominate other candidates if they wish . 
^ such nominations , bearing the signatures of a proposer and seconder , and of the nominee signifying his or her willingness to stand , must be received by the chairman , dr &name &name , at &name college , not less than &num hours before the start of the &name . 
^ the proposed new constitution has been drafted by a sub-committee consisting of &name &name ( convener ) , &name &name , &name &name , &name &name and &name &name . 
^ it was considered by the full committee at its meetings on &num october and &num november &num ; after amendment in the light of discussion at those meetings , it is now unanimously recommended by the committee for approval by the society . 
^ since detailed comparison of the old and new constitutions is a difficult and time-consuming process , this document has been produced to summarize the principal changes which are proposed . 
^ the most important change relates to the society 's officers other than the conductors . 
^ under the existing constitution , all such officers are officially subject to annual election by a ballot of all members in the second half of the &name &name . 
^ in practice this rule seems unworkable , and it has certainly not been enforced within the last &num years . 
^ under the new proposals , the officers will be elected for five-year terms , by a general &name ( normally the annual general &name , in november ) . 
^ this provides a reasonable length of tenure , whilst still giving the society a genuine opportunity to consider at regular intervals whether its officers are doing a good job . 
^ ( the conductor is already on a system of five-yearly appointments , and the assistant conductors are appointed for &num year at a time ; we do not propose any changes in these arrangements . ) 
^ the status of the president and vice-presidents has been changed . 
^ under the existing constitution , they are officers of the society and full members of the committee ; the president is officially supposed to take the chair at general meetings , though in fact the present one has never done so . 
^ under the new proposals , they remain officers , but are not automatically members of the committee ( though they may be co-opted to it if appropriate ) ; the chairman takes over the responsibilities of the president with respect to general meetings , although the president may still chair such meetings if he chooses to do so . 
^ in effect , the status of the vice-presidents becomes akin to that of honorary &name ; so we propose to abolish the separate category of honorary &name ( of whom there are currently none ) and to increase the maximum permitted number of vice-presidents in compensation for this . 
^ the rules on membership have been changed to take account of the new subscription arrangements which were approved by the committee last year , by officially recognizing the separate categories of &name , contributing and hiring &name . 
^ the proposals update the constitution in several ways to take account of developments that have occurred since the present constitution was adopted in &num . 
^ for example , the existing constitution makes no reference to the wind orchestra , since it did not exist in &num ; we have inserted references to it where appropriate . 
^ similarly , we have added a new rule defining the student sub-committees , which have come into being since &num , and we have amended the committee 's membership by deleting the separate orchestra secretary and chorus secretary --- posts which no longer exist --- and adding the webmaster and the official representative of the faculty board of music .
