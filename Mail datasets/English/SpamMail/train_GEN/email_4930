^ sounds great . 
^ yes , the schema will be the same , but somewhere in your type checking / type inferencing code , the union box needs to check the schemas of each of the incoming arcs to make sure they are identical . 
^ the type inference method for the union box would be to simply take the schema of any of its input ports .

^ thanks . 
^ it seems to me that we do n't need to change the schema either . 
^ the incoming arcs towards a union can be easily figured out and i can change the catalogmanager so that it passes a vector of incoming arcs ( &name objects or &name ids whatever ) to the constructor of union class . 
^ just let me know the interface of the union class . 
^ thanks ,

^ i agree . 
^ the other question is whether you need to indicate in the catalogs how many inputs union has - but i wonder if we can figure that out without being explicitly told , upon recreation of the network .

^ i presume that the &name representation of a union could look like a unary box rather than an n-ary box . 
^ and the number of real inputs can be automatically determined by the number of incoming arcs . 
^ i think by doing so , the &name programmers do n't need to specify the number of inputs manually . 
^ &name , in that case , the difference between union and other unaries is that for a unary box of other types , you cannot link &num arcs to the input port whereas you can have more than one incoming arcs for a union . 
^ do you guys agree with me ? 
^ thanks ,

^ union replaces merge , and takes no arguments . 
^ but &name people will have to request the number of input ports .
