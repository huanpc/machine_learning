^ so , i checked with ps &name | grep postmaster and there is indeed no postmaster running on opus . 
^ unfortunately the &name documentation is not saying anything about why there could be a .lock file when no process is running , nor how to solve the problem . 
^ &char quick search on &name does n't return anything else than questions from users with the same problem . 
^ not knowing anything about sockets , &name in general or how to solve that sort of non-documented problem , and having the strong impression that even if i knew , i would lack the rights to , i am stuck with a huge database i ca n't access .

^ did anything change in the configuration of &name at the lab level ? 
^ when launching postmaster ( the database server ) with the usual 
^ postmaster &char /local / scratch / faml2 / corpora / &name / psql_db 
^ i get a fatal error : 
^ fatal &num : ca n't read lock file /tmp / : &name denied . 
</text_embedded>

^ there is no such file on opus . 
^ i have verified /tmp is writeable by me . 
^ please tell me the commands you are using to start the postmaster process . 
^ &name &name , &name lab . , &name &name building , &name &name ave . , &name &name : &num &num &num
