^ hi &name , 
^ hope you had a good weekend . 
^ i 'm starting to think about how i can build a web page that will allow people to test out the anonymiser by uploading an email . 
^ i think the best way to do this is probably to use &name , whereby the user enters the filename of their email , and the data is then transmitted back to the server , converted by the various perl / shell / rasp scripts and then sent back . 
^ this will require &name support . 
^ do you have any suggestions , and do you happen to know whether &name is supported by the &name systems here ? 
^ i 'm thinking of using my public_html space for the web page . 
^ cheers , 
^ &name
