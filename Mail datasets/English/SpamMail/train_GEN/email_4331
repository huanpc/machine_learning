</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

^ just wondered , because &name said i could have my birthday party ( woo-hoo ! 
^ if that 's true ) then and i wondered who was invited . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ the original &num ( ish ) people that &name invited are ( as far as i know ) the 
^ only people who are planning to stay &num nights . 
^ if you want to invite some 
^ other people , that sounds good but you 'd have to speak to &name about it . 
^ i 'm only organising the new years party bit .

^ anyway , yes you can still stay for &num nights - i did n't include that in the invite because the offer is n't open to everyone . 
^ who are you sancioned to invite ? 
^ - well , it 's getting a bit late now and i 'm trying to finalise numbers for &name 's sake , so if you think of anyone who you know has n't been invited , but you really want to invite then let me know &name , and it should be fine .
