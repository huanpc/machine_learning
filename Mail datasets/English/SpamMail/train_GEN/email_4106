^ i understand your annoyance , and i am trying to make a decision . . ... 
^ i know &name will be quite stressed at the moment , so be nice to her . ... ( please ) as i said when i was in &name , i do n't know what my summer is going to be like . 
^ i am busy until probably the end of august . 
^ following that , there is the possiblity of work or phd , hence my non-committal stance . 
^ thirdly , &pound; &num is a lot of money which i do n't know if i have right now . 
^ ( i have to pay for my travel to &name for my interview too - cheeky university ) i 'll think about it , but if you press me now , i 'm leaning towards saying i ca n't go . 
^ &name

^ &name . 
^ we will stay in a large house there . 
^ cost should be around &pound; &num each ( i hope but do n't know ) . 
^ date is provisionally the first week in august , but let me know if that does n't suit . 
^ i think i know that &name , &name , &name and i are keen to go . 
^ &name , &name and &name ca n't come . 
^ that leaves &name , &name , &name and &name . 
^ anyway , i need to know the following from everyone ( except &name , &name and &name - unless their positions have changed ) by thursday &name : 
^ &num - do you want to come ( yes / no ) 
^ &num - can you definitely come ( yes / no ) 
^ i would like to stress that it is not easy to organise a holiday for people who hardly give me any information and thereby appear to lack any interest in the whole affair . 
^ i realise you 're all busy , but i only need &num numbers and &num words . 
^ thank you . 
^ &name
