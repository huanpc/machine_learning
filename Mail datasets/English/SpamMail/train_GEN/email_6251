^ &num star hangover * 
^ no pain . 
^ no real feeling of illness . 
^ you slept in your own bed and when you woke up there were no traffic cones in there with you . 
^ you are still to function relatively well on the energy stored up from all those vodka redbulls . 
^ however , you can drink &num bottles of water and still feel as parched as the &name . 
^ even vegetarians are craving &name and a side of fries . 
^ &num star hangover * * 
^ no pain , but something is definitely amiss . 
^ you may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler . 
^ the coffee you hug to try and remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling gut , which 
^ is craving a full english breakfast . 
^ although you have a nice demeanour about the office , you are costing your employer valuable money because all 
^ you really can handle is some light filing , followed by aimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails . 
^ &num star hangover * * * 
^ slight headache . 
^ &name feels crap . 
^ you are definitely a space cadet and not so productive . 
^ &name a girl or lad walks by you gag because her perfume / aftershave reminds you of the random gin shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer kicked you out at &num : &num a.m. life would be better right now if you were in your bed with a dozen doughnuts and a litre of coke watching daytime tv . 
^ you 've had &num cups of coffee , a gallon of water , &num &name &name and a litre of diet coke yet you have n't peed once . 
^ &num star hangover * * * * 
^ you have lost the will to live . 
^ your head is throbbing and you ca n't speak too quickly or else you might spew . 
^ your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for reeking of booze . 
^ you wore nice clothes , but you smell of socks , and you ca n't hide the fact that you either missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving or it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the dodgems ( depending on your gender ) . 
^ your teeth have their own individual sweaters . 
^ your eyes look like &num big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the second-grade class picture circa &num . 
^ you would give a weeks pay for one of the following - &name time , a doughnut and somewhere to be alone , or a time machine so you could go back and not have gone out the night before . 
^ you scare small children in the street just by walking past them . 
^ &num star hangover * * * * * 
^ you have a second heartbeat in your head , which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you . 
^ vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy . 
^ you still have toothpaste crust in the corners of your mouth from brushing your teeth . 
^ your body has lost the ability to generate saliva , so your tongue is suffocating you . 
^ you 'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body . 
^ death seems pretty good right now . 
^ your boss does n't even get mad at you and your co-workers think that your dog just died because you look so pathetic . 
^ you should have called in sick because , let 's face it , all you can manage to do is breathe . . . ... very gently . 
^ &num star hangover * * * * * * 
^ you arrive home and climb into bed . 
^ &name comes instantly , as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi . 
^ you get about an hours sleep until the noises inside your head wake you up . 
^ you notice that your bed has been cleared for take off and is flying relentlessly around the room . 
^ no matter what you do you now , you 're going to chuck . 
^ you stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in a yacht under full sail . 
^ after walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls knocking off all the pictures , you find the toilet . 
^ if you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your impersonation of walrus mating calls . 
^ you sit there on the floor in your undies , cuddling the only friend in the world you have left ( the toilet ) , randomly continuing to make the walrus noises , spitting , and farting . 
^ help usually comes at this stage , even if it is short lived . 
^ tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts . 
^ help now turns into abuse and he / she usually goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark . 
^ with your stomach totally empty , your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15-minute intervals , but your body wo n't relent . 
^ you are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your tonsils projectile out your mouth on the last occasion . 
^ it is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed . 
^ she / he abuses you again for trying to get into bed with lumpy bits of dried vomit in your hair . 
^ you reluctantly accept their advice and have a shower in exchange for them driving you to the hospital . 
^ work is not an option .
