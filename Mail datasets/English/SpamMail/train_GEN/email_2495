^  um . ^ the price ( probably around  ound;  um ) will not include postage , so i 'm going to ask tomorrow at the post office for postage costs , since we need to put that in the order form . ^  um . ^ we need to write in a word-document an order form , which will be available at our desk on the day of the conference and will be included in the packs given at registration . ^ anyone willing to do this , please e-mail me . ^  um . ^ we also need to finalize formatting of the paper submitted . ^ anyone willinf to do this , please contact me , and we might also get a couple of templates from  ame . ^ this also needs to be done in a word-document . ^ as all this must be done by friday , i ask for your co-operation . ^ waiting for responses have a nice day  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
