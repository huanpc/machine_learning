" electronic creatures " would take no notice , but pranksters would take it as bait . ^  ame move  ame ! ^ threats were spoken unto me , particularly by  ame , but her whimpering henchman ,  ame , (  ame ,  ame ! ! ^ i 'll remember that description ! ) also joined in. ^ . . . . . ... who should i see exiting my room , but  ame . ^ i of course questioned him , accusing him of setting up a " joke " . ^ he told me that he was searching for my due  ame  ame . ^ i persisted in my questioning , but concluded , that he was telling the truth . ^ how wrong i was about him . ^ -  ame , i am appalled ! ! ! ^ seriously ! ^ a joke 's a joke , but do n't lie about it . ^ liars are an abomination . ^ later on that evening , i was in  ame 's room with  ame , and for some reason or another , i was purifying  ame ( what ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) . ^ this usually involves pain , but his has grown resistant to that , so " emotional battering " was taking place . ^ - you have some really weird rituals in  ame  ame does this explain any of the incredibly violent bumps we 've been hearing ? ^ at this  ame flipped . ^ - oh , i 'd have like to have seen that . ^  ame at this time signaled for me to change my key with  ame 's. ^ hmmmn. .. this rather contradicts the claims of  ame  ame that " he has played no part in the events described . " however , the fact that  ame also claims to " bear more than a passing resemblence to a number of well-known personages (  ame  ame ,  ame  ame ,  ame  ame ,  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , etc. ) " throws some doubt upon the truthfulness of his claim . ^ my plan relied on the following assumptions :  har )  ame would not know the number inscribed on his key  har )  ame would not spend the night in  ame 's bed . ^ - oh , honestly  ame ! ^ unfortunately ... both  ame and  ame had known that i was going to do something that night . . . ... both  ame and  ame were awake when i took the picture of "  ame " in his bed . . . . ... they had stolen my sabre . . . ... and after my shower , locked me out of my room . ^ - the moral of the story : just do n't get involved ! ^  ame of the jury , i ask you to bring down fire upon these  um sinners heads , and if not that , at least water balloons . ^ - sorry , but no way . ^ i 'm steering clear . ^ you may say that , in this way , your assailants are getting away with it : but they 're not . ^ they are just sinking in the estimation that we hold of them . </text_embedded>^ goodbye pals , see you later , love  ame xx ^ (  ame - no-one is to get offended by any of my comments ! ) </text_embedded></text_embedded></message_body></message>
