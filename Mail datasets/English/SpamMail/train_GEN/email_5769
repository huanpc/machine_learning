^ &website 
^ the argument against something like this ( except for &name 's) is that it is a central &name event . 
^ i 'll phone &name about this tomorrow . 
^ i have to agree with &name that &char is a denominational issue though ( much as i dislike the implications of that )

^ i give up in my quest for trying to think of something for non-students . ... 
^ &name 
^ i would feel very unhappy putting alpha information on the programme , the course is not non-denominational in the sense that churches through &name differ on their oppinion of &char and whether it is something they should use or not . 
^ plugging &char therefore would therefore simply be us plugging certain churches that have those views without actualy putting down the names of the churches . 
^ i want to stay away from things that devide people and &char is deffinetely something which at the moment divides the churches in &name . 
^ please can you not put &char material on the programme , please though do get back to me on this if you disagree , i would be happy to chat to you about it more . 
^ yours in &name &name 
<text_embedded> 

^ can we put the web-address for the national &char initiative ( &website ? 
^ it 's totally non-denominational and is in line with &name 's aims . 
^ furthermore , we are not making any recommendations about churches , merely a course . 
^ thanks ,
