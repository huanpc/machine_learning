^ hi &name , 
^ i 've just had a look at the anonymiser log , and it appears that the messages you sent were both in mutli-part mime format , but that none of the text was retained . 
^ i would have to look at the original headers for both messages to ascertain exactly why this is , but the second message has a part with type'message / &name " . 
^ this is an unrecognised type and therefore the text would be discarded anyway . 
^ what format are you sending the messages in ?

^ if i put a copy of the directory somewhere you can see it , do you want to try anonymising those ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ sure - then i can also find out why the text is being discarded . 
^ thanks &name ,

^ hi &name , 
^ i just sent a couple of msgs to try but i 've got about &num msgs in a directory 
^ - i 've been collecting non-sensitive non-junk email rather than deleting it . 
^ if i put a copy of the directory somewhere you can see it , do you want to try anonymising those ?
