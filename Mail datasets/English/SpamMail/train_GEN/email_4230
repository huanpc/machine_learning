^ hi again , i just wanted to let you lot know what is going on with &name ( my brother in law ) at present . 
^ some of you are already aware that &name " cancer returned last month and did not look good . 
^ we have all been very worried and it has not been an easy time , although &name and &name are amazing and refuse to complain or let it get them down . 
^ anyway , following extensive tests , we have been informed that the return is worse than we 'd feared . 
^ basically , the cancer has not only returned and spread in the area it was before ( the muscle and nerves of his right shoulder and chest ) , but it is now in several areas of his bones - his pelvis , right hip , and his back . 
^ as this no doubt sounds , it is scarily bad . 
^ the doctors say they will not be able to cure him , and can only try to control the spread and ease the pain . 
^ basically , we 've been told that ( excepting a miracle ) he is going to die , and they are talking months . 
^ i do n't think i have yet properly grasped this idea , but although it is such devastating news , we have handled it amazingly well , and have &name to thank for it . 
^ i do n't understand it , and am not sure i ever will fully , but i do know that &name must know what is going on and if it is part of his plan then , however reluctantly , sobeit . 
^ please pray for &name and &name right now , and for my family and &name " parents as we all come to terms with the news . 
^ on a more cheerful note , my sister &name is getting married on 12th oct to her boyfriend of &num and a half months ( man ! ) . 
^ &name is his name and he 's great . 
^ i 've been busy sorting stuff for the wedding ( designing , making and writing invites etc ) and am to be a bridesmaid - wahay , i get to dress up ! 
^ anyway , it is late and i need some shut-eye . 
^ thanks for reading and for your thoughts and prayers , bye for now , lots of love , &name xxx 
^ chat with friends online , try &name &name : &website
