^ that absolutely was unlucky . 
^ i got back from the train station at &num : &num ( &num : &num &name ) exactly when &name game started . 
^ &name and i waited at the station &num minutes for the next train ... had the next train been just a few minutes earlier &name would have been in my lineup . 
^ anyway , i am just responding to your other email now ... 
^ and i would n't exactly call &name and &name going on the &name as " &name " . 
^ why did you send this one to this account ? 
^ &name

^ i ca n't believe your luck . 
^ faced with a roster crunch when &num guys come off the &name , &num more guys almost immediately go on the &name allowing you to keep everyone . 
^ as opposed to my luck : &name gets hurt and ca n't play ( in my lineup ) but rather than &name him , they decide to make him a pinch hitter so he spends weeks doing me absolutely no good and i ca n't even pick up a player . 
^ &name at least i did n't leave &num &name , a &char , &num shutout innings , and &num &name on my bench . 
^ but that had nothing to do with luck .
