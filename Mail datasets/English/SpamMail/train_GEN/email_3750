^ hi &name , 
^ my dad works for &name ( international oil and services company ) who are very very unlikely to offer you funding as they are tight little # & $ % * ! 
^ however , he sent me this email so if you are needing help with funding still then i 'll forward him the relevant information for you . 
^ if you do n't ask then you 'll never know , right ?

^ &name &name ! 
^ well they do sometimes , but not very often . 
^ it helps if contact between student and company has been made before a request for support . 
^ also this is handled at a fairly local level - there is no " global " fund for this sort of support , so it 's important that the right group in the company supports the application . 
^ much of the digital geology work was started in &name ( in fact , i 've been collecting a few papers for you to read ) as a research topic . 
^ what level of funding are we talking about here ? 
^ if he 's got a &name and project proposal i can look at i 'll see if i can do anything ( but ca n't promise ) .

^ so i would n't get any hopes up whatsoever , but it might be worth a try ... 
^ work hard ! 
^ love from &name .
