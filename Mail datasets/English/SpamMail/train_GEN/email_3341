" laughed and drove off . ^ we never saw them again . ^  ame did some amazing stuff on the camp . ^ some of the times of worship were amazing and  ame spoke to many people , some for the first time . ^  ame ( better mention her somewhere ) had a really good time and it was really good for me that she was there . ^ mid way through camp i shot over to  ame  ame for a wedding which was really good and one of those " could n't have missed it for the world " type weddings . ^ it was just a shame that it was on the opposite side of the country . ^ i brought  ame back here after  ame an after spending a couple of nights here we both travelled down to her house where i stayed for just under a week helping to look after her  um nieces (  um and  um years old ) . ^ it was tiring if fun and great to spend a bit more time with  ame . ^ it 'll be the last time i see her before 23rd september when we 're both back in  ame . ^ that is , of course , if the  ame trip goes ahead . ^ i do n't know how much of the news surrounding  ame and  ame you 've seen but in the last week to  um days things have n't been the rosy and the phrase " they 're killing each other " pretty much sums it up . ^ we 're still wanting to go but if it 's not safe we will have to decided so . ^ on 29th we will make a decision not to go if it 's not safe . ^ if things are okay we will then live an hour at a time until we 're on the plane and in the air ! ^ before then i 've got various bits and pieces on . ^ in a fortnight there 's a holiday club for  um year olds ! ^  ame ! ^ i 've managed to get some reading for my course done , although not a great deal , but at least it 's a start . ^ all things "  ame  har " are picking up speed at the moment . ^ i 'm travelling to  ame a week today and moving some of my stuff in and at the same time getting some essentials from  ame into the flat . ^  ame  ame , electricity , bleach ... ! ! ! ^ anything that is n't too expensive and does n't require a fridge or freezer ! ! ^ over the following month the others are coming for various bits and pieces like regattas and the  ame  ame run . ^ actually you might be able to help ... where do you buy electricity from ? ^ there are n't any power stations in  ame so i 'm not quite sure ! ! ^ i know there 's a shop near by but i 'm not sure which  um and where it is . ^ also , do you buy cards from them or is there a key in the flat you " charge up " ? ^ so many questions ! ! ^ i hope the family and friends visiting was fun , stress free and rewarding for you and that you 're now looking forward to writing your dissertation . ^  ame all is well ,  ame  ame ,  ame </text_normal><text_embedded></text_embedded></message_body></message>
