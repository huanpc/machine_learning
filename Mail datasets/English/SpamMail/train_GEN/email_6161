^ thanks for your e-mail and the information . 
^ &name is looking in the &name 's library , but holds out little hope . 
^ therefore my proposal is as follows ( which &name has seconded ) . 
^ i suggest that we purchase the copy from &name &name as we 'll have this problem again next year ( and the year after .. ) . 
^ i shall buy it and if funds allow within the &name budget then &name can buy it off me . 
^ otherwise it 'll remain my property until the end of our time here at which point i 'll donate it to &name if they intend to continue the &name concerts .

^ &name and &name 
^ just to let you know , as spoke to &name last night , we are still &num conductor 's score short , which we cannot find anywhere from the library . 
^ &name &name has found a copy for &pound; &num from &name &name shop . 
^ are we prepared : 
^ &name to buy it using the &name account 
^ &name to say that he has to buy it himself 
^ &name to offer half / half - so we would pay , say , &pound; &num , and him pay the rest and allow him to keep it . 
^ &name in mind i have spent so far : 
^ &pound; &num on scores &pound; 3approx &num on vocal scores 
^ i have sent this request to &name &name , and this is a copy of that message . 
^ thanks , &name
