^ hi &name , 
^ any of those times is fine for me i think , as i do n't have anything organised for the beginning of term yet as far as i know . 
^ i 'd actually prefer friday afternoon , partly &name its in &name and i do n't want to hang around in teh wgb on thursday or have to make &num trips out there , and partly &name it gives me a little more time to * actually * do the work . 
^ this depends on dr &name though obviously , as he seems to have suggested 4pm which is the only time you do n't appear to be able to do . 
^ so if you want to email him and suggest whatever time on friday that suits you both , or possibly a time on thursday if that does n't work ? 
^ hope you 've had a good holidays so far and have n't done too much work ...

^ dear &name & &name , 
^ we need to arrange a time for your first &name supervision ( for which you will , of course , have finished the work weeks ago ) . 
^ could we do this in &name on wednesday 23rd at &num p.m. if at all possible . 
^ if that does n't work then it would have to be late on thursday afternoon ( &num p.m. ) at the &name &name building or late on friday afternoon ( &num p.m. again ) in &name . 
^ could you please hand in the work to my pigeonhole in &name by lunchtime on tuesday so i get a chance to mark it .
