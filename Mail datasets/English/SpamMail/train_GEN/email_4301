^ we 're playing &name on monday at catz astro at &num ( will email their captain to get pushback changed to &num ) . 
^ as usual , let me know if i can or ca n't play . 
^ i know lots of &char hate monday fixtures , especially after mixed cuppers on sunday , but after losing to &name we need to get some points if we 're gonna make a serious bid for promotion , so please make every effort to play . 
^ anyway , see most of &char on sunday for the match against &name and bring support if i can .
