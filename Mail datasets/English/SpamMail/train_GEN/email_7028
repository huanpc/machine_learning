^ i 'll let &name know that you need the &pound; &num refunded on top of the other receipts that you sent up warlier this week . 
^ these might not come till next week as the distance between girton and homerton is long ( i also fell asleep this afternoon when &char intended osrting out things to send up to &name via &name this evening - sorry ! ) 
^ the mix-up for the email is unusual - i thought i had replied to &name when he first sent an email over a week ago , and when i had n't got a reply &char sent him a reminder . 
^ i 'm not sure whether the email had sent or not . 
^ will endeavour to remember scissors and pritt-stick on sunday. .

^ dear &name and &name , 
^ sorry , there has clearly been a case of misunderstanding here . 
^ i thought that &name had dealt with this already so assumed it was a job done . 
^ sorry , i should have checked that we all knew what was going on . 
^ anyway , i 've put &num checks in &name 's pigeon hole payable to &name and &name for &pound; &num each , drawn on my bank account . 
^ these should allow &name to get them off quickly to them . 
^ &name - i need therefore &pound; &num from &name reimbursement 
^ &name - you 'll need to let &name have a receipt or something which confirms the cost . 
^ if you could also let her have any other invoices ( party costs , chamber organ .. ) and the money for the extra adult ticket mentioned in &name 's e-mail , that 'd be really helpful . 
^ i too would like to have the accounts wrapped up . 
^ many thanks 
^ love &name

^ am &char right in thinking that this ( below ) is just a case of confusion and that you have n't already asked &name for a cheque ?
