^ dear &name , 
^ the reason i was avidly pursuing the &name / virus thing this morning was because i had a nasty day yesterday , since i had a &name crisis , and i knew i was going to have another one today . 
^ therefore i was in rather a bad mood and it helped to take my frustratinos out on something else . 
^ it was not a competititive " boy thing " , although it probably looked like that .
