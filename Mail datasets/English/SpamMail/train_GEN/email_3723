^ dear everyone , 
^ the holiday ... 
^ we are going to a village called &name . 
^ we have the house from &num noon on saturday the 6th july to &num noon on saturday the 13th july . 
^ so people can arrive any time after &num noon on saturday . 
^ if you 're arriving via train and need picked up from the nearest station ( &name ) then speak to &name or &name as they are bringing their cars . 
^ things to bring ... 
^ sleeping bag , pillow and pillow-case ( if possible as there are not enough pillows for us all there ) , tea towel , the usual stuff like clothes . 
^ special request from &name for as many people as possible to bring garden spades ... ( obviously if you 're coming a long way by train you might want to think twice about this , but the more the merrier ) . 
^ people might want to bring board games , cds , books , etc. 
^ i guess some people will be bring a football , aerobie , sporting equipment ? 
^ food ... 
^ we have come up with a flexible guide to who 's cooking together . 
^ &name , &name ( barbeque ) , &name & &name , &name & &name , &name & &name , &name . 
^ &name this is okay with everyone . 
^ we will need &num evening meals , and if you can count then you 'll see there 's only &num lots of people - reason is that it 's &name 's birthday ( ! ) on the monday and she would like us to celebrate with her by going out for pizza ! 
^ anyway , we can sort out who does which days and so on when we get there and obviously the &name will be dependent on the weather . 
^ ca n't think of any more to say right now except have a great week whatever you 're doing and i look forward to seeing you all on saturday . 
^ &name
