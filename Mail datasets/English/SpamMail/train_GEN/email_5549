^ &name dear friends , 
^ i 'm organising a fat night at &name cellars on friday and i 'm sending this to everyone i know who i think would enjoy it . 
^ the idea is simply to create enough mad raucous energy to make everyone go ferral . 
^ in this we are well practised and we do it through a combination of live percussion bands , shouting , screaming and &name heavy tunes coming out of the soundsystem . 
^ it 's at &name college and will be absolutely wicked , please come . 
^ i do n't like hardsell . 
^ here 's the lineup : 
^ in the main room : 
^ &num &num - &name &name : brazilian d' n' &char 
^ &num &num - &name &name : bassheavy &num funk and miscellanity 
^ &num &num - &name : live loud african percussion 
^ &num &num - &name &name : old skool d' n' &char and jungle 
^ &num &num - &name &name : &num piece live samba band playing heavy rhythms 
^ in the other room we have a live drum circle led by the legendary &name alongside the justifiably famous daddy of anti-capitalism , &name &name , plus live slide projections . 
^ never forget the bar and free cloakroom . 
^ much love 
^ &name &name &name &name &name
