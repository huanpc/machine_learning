^ hopefully this will be a little longer and more coherent than the last one ! 
^ yesterday saw a mass &name from college with the majority of people leaving sometime during the day , i was one of them . 
^ having spoken to &name most of the rest left this morning following a fire alarm at 5am after someone burnt some sausages ! ! 
^ on thursday night " &name &char " had our first meal together in &name vac kitchen . 
^ it was really good and we managed to sort out loads of things , food likes / dislikes , money , meals , rooms , what needs to be bought etc etc. it 's looking like it should be a really good flat , and we and the other &num in &name &char & i have been asked to host the freshers " week party ! 
^ we 've draughted in the &name to help tidy up afterwards and we 're locking all doors , but i think it 's a goer . 
^ since getting at &name yesterday i 've pretty much got my room back to normal . 
^ there are a few bits and pieces that i need to do but nothing major . 
^ i 've also been down to church to be introduced to the strimmer , a piece of equipment i will get to know quite well over the next week as &name ( friend from &name ) , the strimmer and myself raise &pound; 100-&pound; &num towards going to &name ! 
^ &name ! 
^ i 've got quite a few other odd-jobs lined up too as well as going to &name and producing the songbook for church . 
^ there are quite a few things i 've got to do and i think that the possibility of getting a job has gone of the window because i want to do some reading for next year and have a bit of a holiday in the middle . 
^ &name did n't take that long on thursday . 
^ &char quick visit to &name and then middle eastern and islamic studies to register " &name and &name in the 20th century " before a &num minute queue at &name &name . 
^ others had it better , others worse and i 'm not complaining . 
^ &name &name resigned as social sec . 
^ due to finding it too difficult to balance the academic and exec commitments . 
^ &name &name ( 1st year on &name ) is acting social sec . 
^ for &num weeks into next term when there will be a by-election for the post . 
^ more work for me ! 
^ i 'm probably heading to &name 's sometime during august to take some stuff up there and get some preparation work done and then heading up 23rd september to stay . 
^ i do n't want to be snowed under with social secretary by-election stuff during the first &num weeks of term , ditto 1st &name &name meeting . 
^ &name &name failed all modules and did n't attend lectures , i do n't fancy his chances at passing everything at re-sits . 
^ if he 's not back i 'll have to chair the meeting too . 
^ &name ! ! 
^ i hope everything is going well with you and the mapping is going well . 
^ &name &char reminded everyone one of the freshers " and toothbrush thing during the last cu of term so hopefully everyone will remember over the summer !
