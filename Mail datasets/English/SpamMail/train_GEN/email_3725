^ re : &name 's birthday ... i 've been struggling for ideas for a present 
</text_embedded>

^ for &name 
<text_embedded> 

^ but remembered today that she often says that she 's missed out on 
</text_embedded>

^ lots of 
<text_embedded> 

^ things because she did n't go on exciting holidays when she was 
</text_embedded>

^ little . 
^ now , 
<text_embedded> 

^ clearly we ca n't take her backpacking &name &name , but some of the 
</text_embedded>

^ things 
<text_embedded> 

^ are more managable . 
^ specifically , she 's never been horse riding . 
</text_embedded>

^ there are 
<text_embedded> 

^ &num places in &name that i 've got phone numbers for from the 
</text_embedded>

^ internet , but 
<text_embedded> 

^ before i ring to book her a session , i was just wondering if &char ) you 
</text_embedded>

^ thought 
<text_embedded> 

^ it was a good idea and &char ) if anyone else would like to come . 
^ you 'll 
</text_embedded>

^ have to 
<text_embedded> 

^ pay for yourselves though ! 
^ and i need to check that it wo n't 
</text_embedded>

^ interfere with 
<text_embedded> 

^ anyone else 's plans for monday . 
^ i was also wondering if perhaps 
</text_embedded>

^ there was a 
<text_embedded> 

^ way of turning the day into an activity day for ruth-perhaps there 
</text_embedded>

^ are other 
<text_embedded> 

^ fun things she has n't done that we could book for her as birthday 
</text_embedded>

^ presents , 
<text_embedded> 

^ like absailing or parachuting ( or then again , maybe not ! ) .
