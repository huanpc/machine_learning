^ dear sir 
^ we are looking to take on a computer undergraduate during the summer vacation to help out in a number of projects . 
^ we use a number of programming languages but mainly c++ and visual basic . 
^ the work would be supervised but we do expect the student to be able to program code unaided . 
^ a lot of what we do is with cameras , lenses and focussing systems so it would suit somebody who has an interest in this area . 
^ the work will involve developing auto focus algorithms for cameras being developed for the next generation of mobile phones . 
^ if anyone in your college is interested please ask them to e-mail their cv to me for consideration . 
^ regards 
^ dr &name &name ( &email ) &name group manager
