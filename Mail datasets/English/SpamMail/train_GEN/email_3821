^ &name , thanks for your email . 
^ we have not yet developed the projects for next year so i advise you to keep an eye on the department web site in november when i expect that projects will go up . 
^ your ideas on mapping sound interesting although its not in genereal in an area where we are focussing at the moment . 
^ by all means apply when we put the projects up . 
^ in the meantime i suspect that you might contact &name &name at &name if you interest is in remote sensing and perhaps &name rothery at the open university . 
^ &name we do have a position for an experimentalist here to run lab . 
^ experiments if this interest you copuld you send me a cv .

^ dear prof. &name , 
^ please allow me to introduce myself . 
^ my name is &name &name and i have just graduated from the university of &name , with first class honours in geology . 
^ i am currently undertaking a msc in geographical information management at &name university . 
^ i had planned to start a phd project in &name in october &num - until that fell through due to &name funding problems . 
^ for about &num months i tried to find alternative external sponsorship from many sources , but in the end my search proved unfortunately , fruitless . 
^ the project i had hoped to embark upon was to look at the integration of new hardware and software in the field of &name - particularly tools like &name and &name - and the application of such digital mapping techniques to a geological problem ; the intrusion architecture of the whin sill . 
^ i am still very keen to further pursue my education to &name level , and this is the purpose of writing to you . 
^ i was wondering if you , or another member of your department might consider putting in a phd proposal in my general field of interest . 
^ during my undergraduate mapping project , which involved the mapping and basic study of a small chain of &num year old rhyolitic lava domes in &name &name , i was struck by the " outdatedness " of the traditional pen and paper mapping methods taught in geology . 
^ i was looking in some detail at the textural heterogeneities in the lavas and their relation to the emplacement of the domes . 
^ as i climbed about on the glassy , blocky surface of the lava , i soon came to realise that the methods that we had been taught would not easily apply to this situation , where one textural facies would grade into the next , with much intermixing . 
^ there were few sharp " boundaries " , and i soon found myself with a ridiculous number of facies for domes that had at most &num chemically distinct lavas . 
^ what i concluded was that the production of a database containing the percentage and size of vesicles , size of phenocrysts and other measurable features at various localities across the domes - then forming a computer-created map , or maps with gradational boundaries would have made far more sense , and would have produced a project that would have had a firmer base in reality and did not result in the construction of so many artificial boundaries , as mine had done . 
^ this led to my wanting to advance the application of the new technology being developed to geological situations and hence to my desire to undertake a phd in this area . 
^ i suppose my " ideal " phd would involve the study of recent or present day volcanic areas with the most up to date technologies available . 
^ perhaps the combination of satellite imagery or other remotely sensed data , firmly correlated with good field work would produce a useful and interesting project ? 
^ as i mentioned above , i became interested in the idea of a " better " way of mapping when i was on my undergraduate mapping project . 
^ what came to my mind there was a very much land-based &name geological survey with digital equipment and a new form of " continuum based " description suitable for the rhyolitic lavas that i was examining . 
^ since then , i have started to consider remote sensing as a very useful tool and am undertaking the masters in geographical information management to discover more about such techniques . 
^ i am interested in volcanology , not so much because of a huge amount of previous detailed study in my first degree , but rather by the fact that volcanoes are so visibly dynamic ( unlike so much of geology ) , potentially life threatening and as a result , a better understanding of these features could have life-saving potential for some people who live in the shadow of these mountains . 
^ as a natural conclusion of these &num interests a phd combining both remote sensing and also recent volcanism might be ideal . 
^ i have had a few ideas about possible phd projects , which could be very useful and interesting . 
^ &num idea , as set out above , based largely on the problems encountered with my undergraduate mapping project , is to develop a more informative way of mapping lava flows - combining remotely sensed data with hard geological data , comparing the &num sets to see if a more accurate , and much faster way of mapping can be determined . 
^ the second idea would be to try to build up as accurate a picture of a recently active volcano , or volcanoes as possible , with the result perhaps leading to better overall understanding of volcanic systems and hence better hazard prediction and prevention . 
^ what i might suggest would be to build a three-dimensional model ( on the computer of course ) of a volcano , through time . 
^ it would be a good idea to find a volcano with a lot of data on it , collected over a period of time of quiescence , leading up to and through an eruption . 
^ &name , gas emissions , ground movement , seismicity , temperature surveys , water table levels and other measurable features would be placed in &num dimensions on the model . 
^ once this was done , it might be possible to get a clearer picture of what is happening in relation to pre-existing lines of weakness , lithological or textural variations within the volcanic system . 
^ i do n't know if something like this has been done before , but even if it has , it might be good to build up such " time - event " images of other volcanoes in order to make some comparison between them . 
^ this would be important , because , in my limited understanding , it seems rational to me to assume that volcanoes are all quite different . 
^ but to find some underlying sequence that might precede eruption in many volcanoes , perhaps in a similar setting to each other ; this could be very significant . 
^ if an idea like these is interesting , then perhaps you might consider making a proposal of a phd in this area in the coming year ? 
^ thanks again for your time ,
