^ &char is a royal pain in the ass - i think he practices . 
^ he still goes on about fitba all the bloody time . 
^ he 's ill just now and is coughing everywhere . 
^ he makes no attempt to keep it down , which is really annoying when you 're studying or sleeping . 
^ and the other night he banged on my wall cuz he decided he wanted to go to sleep and i was still on the exercise bike & playing music . 
^ hmph. 
^ &char is not too bad . 
^ she is also ill and sneezes &char . 
^ loudly . 
^ grrr. so they have been off work the last couple of days so i have n't had the house to myself which really sucks , particularly when &char is always coming up and asking if i want anything to eat or whatever . 
^ yeah , i think i could get it myself if i wanted it . 
^ &name off . 
^ or at the dinner table , if i wanted fucking tatties , i would take fucking tatties . 
^ and when i say i do n't to finish the lasagne , it 's cuz i do n't want to finish the bloody lasagne . 
^ &name ! 
^ ok , breathe .
