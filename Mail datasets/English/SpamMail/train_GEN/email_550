^ 'dear babe ( you do kinda remind me of the pig ... ) " 
^ - i shall try to take that in the nicest possible sense . 
^ " thanks for your help ; sorry it was n't more of a proper conversation ! " 
^ - you 're quite welcome . 
^ is the confusion tactic having any success ? 
^ i 'm sure the scroll-list thing will not be endless , and that if you type in enough false passwords , your one will eventually not appear . 
^ " i do n't think i am going to have time this hol to come visit , unfortunately , but next summer i definitely will unless i 've offended you irreparably ( likely ) . " 
^ - oh good ! 
^ i look forward to that . 
^ of course you have n't offended me ! 
^ why would you think that ? 
^ do you think i 'm easily offended ? 
^ " we have a new car . 
^ it 's big . " 
^ - very nice .
