^ &name scary ! 
^ i emailed &name yesterday saying that i had forwarded heaps of crap to you and yet you never replied about any of them ( even he did ) - but maybe he told you . 
^ i have been meaning to email but yes , i am sooooo busy . 
^ &name is fucking insane just now . 
^ on top of all the exams and assignments , we are currently in the middle of the " intent to register " period . 
^ this is when you fill in form to declare that you want to come bakc next year and what program you want to go into ( since first year is pretty general and you can change your program if you want) . 
^ i went to a counselling session about it - which i thought would tell me jsut how to fill in my form . 
^ but the woman started talking about post-grad degrees and what we 're aiming for and all the courses we 'd need to take . 
^ it 's like , fuck 's sake , i 'm only first year , leave me alone . 
^ but i suppose i do have to plan my courses - there are prerequisites all the way up the years so if i 'm aiming for physio i have to take certain &num and oh it 's confusing . 
^ but i do n't do that til the summer . 
^ but now my form is in and it 's cool . 
^ i 'm going for &name honours &name - so hopefully my grades stay up and i get in. 
^ other than that , it 's just been uni . 
^ well , almost . 
^ went to see the phonics last thursday in &name . 
^ they were amazing as usual . 
^ but it was mad . 
^ i met up with &name ( the girl from &name i was out in touch with ) and &name &name ( remember my mate ffrom primary school ? 
^ - she 's taking a gap year out here) . 
^ anyway , tehn they brought their friends and flatmates so we had &num brochers , an aberdonian , a &name - eh- an ? , a mancunian and a londoner . 
^ then in the queue &name spotted another guy she knows who 's taking a gap year from &name . 
^ and inside i got taling to a guy from &name . 
^ it was insane . 
^ the place was full of " brits " . 
^ ( hate that word but it 's the easiest way to say it) . 
^ the phonics were magic as usual . 
^ they did handbags and gladrags which was great . 
^ i got &name to make a banner that said " who loves you , baby ? " in welsh and she drew a big scottish flag on it . 
^ she got it displayed on the barrier at the front at &num point so they were all smiling and apparently &name took a beamer . 
^ &name ! 
^ it was great . 
^ they 're coming back in september so i want to go with a new banner " still love you baby!' . 
^ it 'd be great .

^ but i had to miss most of the encore cuz i had to get the last bus home ( 00.30am - uuurgh ) cuz i had a bio lab i could n't miss at &num the next day . 
^ i also had a midterm that afternoon - which was fun . 
^ hmph. it went ok though . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i was supposed to have &num midterms but i 'm getting to take the physics make-up - which is on monday so sounds like that 'll be a tough day for both of us ( good luck by the by) . 
^ i realised yesterday i really do n't know as much as i thought i did so i 'm cramming like mad this weekend - this is only a wee break of course . 
^ ( ahem ! ) 
^ some advice for you . ... stay away from &name ! ! ! ! ! 
^ it 's the second most awful drink i 've tasted in my entire puff . 
^ &name . 
^ &name has apparently taken to drinking flaming sambucas - is she mad ? 
^ i think so . 
^ at present my last exam is supposed to be on the 27th april but it wo n't be finalised til the end of feb. but i 'll definitely be home for your graduation anyway . 
^ had n't thought about who i 'd be going with like . 
^ are ewan and &name going ? 
^ ok , i should get back to some vibrational motion and standing waves and all the other shit these evil people are tormenting me with . 
^ &name te ye seen . 
^ &name luv , &name xx
