" i like that . ^ anyway , i hope your first term goes well . ^ we 'll look forward to those email updates . ^ bye for now  ame ,  ame and the gang  miley ^ at  um :  um am  um /  um /  um  um , you wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ hello all ! ^ i am back in the crazy world of  ame  ame 's college , after a busy and thoroughly enjoyable summer . ^ the main focus of this term will be upon my dissertation - which follow on from the research i was doing in  ame this summer . ^ it is funny being back in college with load of new first years running around . ^ people who do n't know how to e-mail , or use the darkroom , or how to go to bed on time ... ( oh , how old am i ? ! ) ^ yesterday was a glorious day with a beautiful blue sky , scattered here and there with the occasional cloud so as not to make it overwhelmingly monotonous . ^ today is cold and rainy . ^ i have taken up playing field hockey , and am quite enjoying that . ^ my friend  ame says that i am rather violent though . ^ (  ame , violent ? ^ - never ! ) still , it should be fun to keep at . ^ i turned down a place on the university fencing team to play college hockey , so i really hope that i get in.  um suppose if i do n't i can just spend more time looking at rocks down a microscope ... ^ this final year at college is looking like it will be busy , yet rewarding . ^ at this time i would appreciate your prayers for my future though , as i am at a loss for what to do . ^ i have concidered so many things , and am not sure what i will do . ^ i hope you are well ! ^ lots of love , ^  ame  ame  ame  ame ^ st.  ame 's college ^  um  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ^ department of geological sciences university of  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
