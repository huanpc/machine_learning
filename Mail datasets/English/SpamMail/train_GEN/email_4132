^ dear &name , 
^ &name new year to you and your family ! 
^ for the flight look at &website the flight i mentioned to you is on wed , &num january from &name &name to &name , at &num . 
^ the cost without taxes is &num pounds if you want to leave the day before , at &num , the price is &num pounds . 
^ you can also explore to arrive at &name &name . 
^ we 'll organize your seminar at &num o' clock on &num january . 
^ so you 'll be free to leave , say &num a.m. i 'd suggest you to visit &name or &name . 
^ in &name the temperature is higher than in &name and the climate is as in spring time . 
^ &name has got more a continental climate ( only &num hours far from &name , or even less ) . 
^ the art is incredible in both cities , but the atmosfere in &name is more lively . 
^ from &name to &name by train is about &num hours if you choose &name you have to loook at &name air from &name &name , if you choose &name , you have to look at &name , that is a town i guess &num hour far from &name . 
^ leaving from &name i guess is easier than leaving from &name . 
^ you can also explore the easyjet website to look for return flights 
^ &website . 
^ to brouse the train time table to go from &name to &name or &name , look at the following website : 
^ &website 
^ &num way to &name is about &num &name in &num class and &num in first class .

^ dear &name , 
^ &name new year ! 
^ i do not know if you received the message below .

^ dear &name , 
^ thank you for the very useful information . 
^ i think i should definitely aim to be at &name 's seminar . 
^ therefore , we should use the early departure at &num : 15am . 
^ we have decided not to bring &name because he has a number of activities with which the trip might conflict . 
^ therefore it will only be &name and &name from what you said , it sounds like &name might be a better option than &name ( perhaps particularly in january ) . 
^ is that true ? 
^ i would appreciate advice on the flights ( returning on sunday at a reasonable time ) but you do not need to pay for them . 
^ just let me know what you think is the best option . 
^ &char possible title for the seminar could be 
^ 'multiplicity issues in clinical trials and &name based genetic epidemiology " 
^ thanks again for the invitation and your help , 
^ &name
