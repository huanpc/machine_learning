^ hi &name : 
^ &name new year . . . . . . . . . . . ... hope you had a good time at &name 's . 
^ tried phoning you on &name , new year 's day and today . 
^ got a busy signal today , so you were probably &name , the other times , the phone just rang . 
^ i talked to your dad today and he said you spent &name with &name , i hope you did n't lead my sister astray . 
^ i had thought of phoning &name but thought i 'd leave it till &name and your dad gets there as i had spoken to &name and &name on christmas day . 
^ &name arrived in &name on thursday with a tooth ache and ended up getting the tooth extracted on friday . 
^ we has lunch and a few drinks with him on saturday , then picked him up on sunday afternoon and he stayed till this afternoon . 
^ he brought with him a fart machine with remote control from british home stores which was quite disgusting , but after a few drinks was quite acceptable . 
^ he was getting everyone as they came in the house and bent down to take their boots off . 
^ we had planned a quiet &name because the weather was n't all that great . 
^ we ended up with a small crowd but the time jus flew by and it was &num am when our last guests left . 
^ i talked to &name for a while then cleared up so it was after &num am by the time i got to bed . 
^ i was up at 11am because &name 's mam had stayed the night and i was going to make breakfast . 
^ but when i got up she had flown the coop and left us a note . 
^ had i known she was n't there i would have stayed in bed for a while and let &name and &name fend for themselves . 
^ however &name made breakfast and it was very good . 
^ we had a reasonably quite day and a nice dinner then &name conked out about 9pm . 
^ we had an early dinner this afternoon then returned &name to his daughter 's . 
^ i think he took half of the contents of my fridge with him , each time i asked if he would use something he said yes . 
^ so he 's away with roast beef , meatballs in gravy , a huge tuna / cheese log , all kinds of christmas biscuits , cake , chocolate and lots of sweet junk . 
^ he has enough to last till the end of the week . 
^ so the birds missed out on the shortbread and stuff , although we still have lots of nuts and stuff . 
^ are you going up to &name to stay at &name 's when &name and your dad are in &name ? 
^ we start work tomorrow , what a thought . 
^ will try and get in contact next weekend . 
^ &name . . ... &name &amp; &name
