^ hey guys 
^ about follow-up things for non-students , we ca n't as &name publish a recomended list of churches or start saying anything about individual churches , recomending some and not others . 
^ the only way i thought that we could follow these people up is sell copies of " a fresh start " and give away " the choice we all face " booklets . 
^ i know this is far from ideal but the only way that i think as &name that is non-dinominational can do it . 
^ we must pray to &name that they are followed up by other christian friends , or talks , many might come with their christian friends . 
^ sorry guys about that i know it sounds lame but we ca n't start giving info about churches at a central &name event as it were . 
^ your bro &name

^ dear &name , 
^ we have a slight problem in how to do follow-up for non-students . 
^ &name cannot give a list of churches can they . 
^ however , we need a way of getting non-christian non-students to some sort of follow-up . 
^ &name suggested that we could suggest a website with recommended churches on ( &name &name group recommends churches on its website ) . 
^ it would be easy for us to set one up .
