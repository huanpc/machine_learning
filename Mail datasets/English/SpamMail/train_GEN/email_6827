^ according to &website " the &name college &name &name exists ... " 
^ i thought &name college cu as part of &name existed to make &name &name known to students in &name college. [ .. ]

^ well the website linked to certainly agrees with you there ;- ) . 
^ if we 're going to do anything we probably ought to start by sending a copy of your email to &name . 
^ i did start an email to &email asking what the procedure for changing the text was , but as my name / crisd is n't mentioned anywhere on the site i realised it might look a little odd ( i suppose i could seruptiously add it somewhere ) , but if &name and karuna want me to do that then i can . 
^ i wonder how important it is : after all anyone who cares will follow the link , and then they 'll given the full picture , and the text does n't say anything untrue . 
^ i wonder : is that the appropriate place to advertise &name 's aims ? 
^ but then i suppose anyone who cares is liable to come across &name 's mission statement in short order , and we 're not ashamed of the gospel . 
^ &name over it again it could do with some rewording , apparently : " help christians [ ... ] feel part of a larger community " larger than what ? 
^ their church ? 
^ the college ? 
^ in summary i do n't think it 's a big deal , as the website is clear , but if you ( &name and &name ) feel it 's appropriate then i 'll see about getting it changed .
