^ hello &name ! 
^ this is just to let you all know that coming to a pigeon hole near you should be some fliers for the &name cafe . 
^ please distribute them to international students and encourage them to come along if they 'd like to ... having a flier to give someone makes a good excuse to go visit and say hello ! 
^ let me draw your attention especially to the squash - its going to be 3-5pm in the &name &name hall . ... all the details are on the flier , do offer to bring along anyone who is interested ! 
^ if you need more then let me know and i 'll send some your way - or if you 're at the freshers " fair you can go get some from the &name stall . 
^ if you have more than you need then please do return them to me rather than filing them in the bin ! 
^ we can use them somewhere !

^ love &name
