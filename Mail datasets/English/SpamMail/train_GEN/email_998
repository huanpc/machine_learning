^ &name , 
^ i was under the impression that the party was from 31st to the 2nd . 
^ was i wrong ? 
^ if the party is only for &num day then it 's a very very long way to come from &name for such a short time . 
^ also , why are we arriving so late on the 31st ? 
^ my train might get in a lot earlier . 
^ thirdly , how can we forward this to people you may have missed out if we ca n't see who you 've sent it to ? 
^ you did something funny with the sent field and it appears only to have been sent to you . 
^ looking forward to seeing you and having my queries cleared up .
