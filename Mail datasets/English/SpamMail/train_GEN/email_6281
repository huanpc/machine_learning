^ ok , so i should have checked the time , but i turned up at &name and found i was already too late - sorry ! 
^ i started to walk waterbeach direction ( with the hope of meeting you all at &name ) , but soon decided that walking alone in the rain along a familiar route was not much fun , so went to the museum of technology , which was very interesting & more importantly , dry ! 
^ anyway , it still leaves the persistant issue . 
^ how are you fixed up this week ? 
^ take care and &name bless ,
