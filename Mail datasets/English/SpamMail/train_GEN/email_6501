^ hello everyone 
^ further to the previous email , the folder reorganisation is now completed , for the moment at least . 
^ please take the time to read through this email carefully , since it affects everyone in the group . 
^ firstly , i would like to apologise if this reorganisation has caused inconvenience to anyone . 
^ i hope that it has not , but please let me know if there is something about the new structure that you dislike . 
^ in particular , i would like to apologise to &name , who has put a great amount of work into creating and recreating the repository . 
^ i hope that reorganising our files has not caused any problems . 
^ the previous repository , and all files therein , has been completely archived in multiple locations . 
^ the intention has been to reorganise our current content , so that files are more logically categorised . 
^ i hope that people find it easier to navigate and find the files they want . 
^ the main guiding principles have been : 
^ + the usage of human-readable folder names throughout . 
^ + adherence ( nearly ) to the decisions made at our last review meeting . 
^ a rundown of the new structure is given below , but firstly i 'd like to draw your attention to some important points : 
^ &name 
^ everything in this email refers to our file-space on &name , 'specifically &website / societies / &name / " and not the &name file-space . 
^ &name 
^ &char complete backup of the entire folder structure within " /societies / &name / " was taken before the folder reorganisation was performed . 
^ the new structure was built side-by-side with the previous structure . 
^ a second backup of the structure was taken after the new structure was built . 
^ &website / " , &website " was taken to be the time of backup . 
^ after the second backup was performed , the previous structure was removed . 
^ each of these backups are mirrored on another server in the event of catastrophic failure . 
^ these careful steps were taken to ensure that the entire structure was carefully backed up in case of errors or omissions in the new structure . 
^ &name 
^ the following folders have not been reorganised : 
^ /societies / &name / cgi-bin / /societies / &name / public_html / 
^ question : does this last folder contain manually generated documentation ? 
^ if so , maybe we should consider moving the source files to the repository , leaving only generated files in public_html . 
^ &name files are also subject to revision . 
^ &name &name &name 
^ societies / &name / archive / snapshots of the previous and current folder structures for archival . 
^ bin / privately accessible utilities , ( including the &name viewer ) . 
^ cgi-bin / publicly accessible utilities . 
^ public_html / &name root . 
^ repository / the &name repository folder . 
^ &name / the root " &name " module . 
^ documentation / documentation . 
^ agendas / agendas . 
^ deliverables / &name documents . 
^ presentation / presentation material requirements / requirements . 
^ research / our research files . 
^ specification / the current specification . 
^ &name / project standards . 
^ strategy / strategy documentation . 
^ tasks / current task lists . 
^ source / &name source files . 
^ &name / root package name . 
^ distribution / experimental / mathematical / factorisation / &name / pollardrho / quadraticsieve / trialdivision / functional / storage / test / validation / 
^ &name &name 
^ as mentioned in the above diagram , a new repository folder has been created , namely /societies / &name / repository / . 
^ if you are using &name in &name , you will need to change the &name environment variable like so : 
^ &name &name : ext : &email:/societies / &name / repository / 
^ where " usrid " is your hermes user id . 
^ i 've attempted to put all source files in the repository . 
^ if you think any have been left out , first check through renamed files , then please look in /societies / &name / archive / ... 
^ please note that as a general rule , no generated files are to be placed in the repository . 
^ &name code changes 
^ where possible , existing source code has been updated to reflect the small changes in the package structure . 
^ this has been done to minimise inconvenience to all those in the programming team . 
^ please accept my apologies if i missed anything , my intention has not been to break things that already compile successfully . 
^ and finally ... 
^ if you 're reading this , then thanks for your time in digesting this email . 
^ i would suggest that someone in our group should be assigned the general responsibility of maintaining our folders in logical state . 
^ otherwise , things tend to get a little disorganised ... &smiley 
^ look forward to seeing everyone tomorrow . 
^ i 'm now off to bed for some rest . ... ( finally ! ) 
^ all the best 
^ &name 
^ " we are all in the gutter , but some of us are looking up at the stars . " &name &name
