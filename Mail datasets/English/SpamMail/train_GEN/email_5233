^ &name , 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name mentioned at the council meeting that you were interested in setting up a &name go challenge , similar to the chess challenge , for school children . 
^ i think this is a good idea , and i 'd like to help out with the general getting-it-off-the-ground organization . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that would be really helpful . 
^ at this stage it seems that lots of people are enthusiastic about the idea , but i could really do with some help on organization / planning as i 'm sure that what i can do by myself is limited . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i ca n't really offer to do more than that because i do n't know whether i 'll still be in the country come september . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that is ok . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ would you like to meet up to discuss some ideas ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i think that would be a good idea . 
^ are there any evenings this week that you can do ( it is a good time for me as my in-laws are visiting so it makes it easier for me to go out as there are more people to help with the children ) ? 
^ perhaps you could give me the youth newsletters at the same time ? 
^ ( by the way , the junior club has stopped meeting now until after the summer ) . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ or email me your thoughts so far ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ the e-mail i sent to the youth discussion group is below . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ my feeling is that , with all the good work &name &name is doing , there will be more and more schools with go clubs , so maybe there wo n't be many entrants this year , but in future years it could become a very worthwhile event . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that is what i hope . 
^ thanks ,

^ copy of e-mail sent to youth discussion group : 
^ i promised to send out an e-mail on the proposal to set up a &name go challenge along the lines of the very successful &name &name challenge competition . 
^ the background to this is that i spoke to &name &name , who runs the &name &name &name , in january . 
^ although i was contacting him about something else , i mentioned to him that i thought it would be nice to have a go event similar to the &name &name challenge . 
^ he was quite positive about the idea , so i said i would get back to him sometime later in the year with some firmer proposals . 
^ he said that september was his least busy time of the year , but i said i would try to get back to him before then . 
^ below i have listed : &num ) background - what the &name &name challenge is and how it works &num ) could there be a go version ? 
^ what are the possible benefits / problems ? 
^ &num ) what we would have to do / next steps 
^ please can people let me have any comments on this ! 
^ if the whole idea is a dead duck , i think it is best to decide that as soon as possible . 
^ however , i think that if it can be done there is a lot of potential to bring go to a lot more young people and schools ( and i think it could fit in very well with the existing &name project ) . 
^ so any positive ideas on how to make it work would be very useful . 
^ thanks , 
^ &name

^ &num the &name &name &name 
^ the &name &name &name , which began in &num , is an extremely successful national chess competition for juniors . 
^ it is organised by &name &name and has a website at &website as the largest chess tournament in the world . 
^ the numbers of schools and individuals taking part has increased year by year . 
^ in the &num event , there have been &num , &num children from &num , &num schools taking part ! 
^ each school or junior club which wants to run a heat of the &name &name &name pays an entry fee , which i think is currently around &pound; &num . 
^ for this they get sent a pack including a wallchart , pairing cards and prizes ( they also get several nicely produced newsletters sent during the year ) . 
^ the heat is held in the &name &name and is a 7-round swiss competition , usually played as &num game each week at the school chess club for &num weeks . 
^ players score &num points for a win , &num for a draw and &num for a loss ( &num if they miss that &name ) . 
^ there are all sorts of small prizes for getting certain numbers of points - little mascots , keyrings , etc. - and each player also gets a badge with spaces to add a gold spot for each &num points they score . 
^ the top player in the school gets a small trophy and anyone winning &num games out of &num gets an extra prize . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ from the school heats , players can qualify for a regional megafinal . 
^ to qualify , they usually need to score about &num points , depending on their age group . 
^ but also the best boy and best girl in each age group qualify automatically so long as they played in at least &num rounds . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ the entry fee for the megafinal is around &pound; &num per player . 
^ there are about &num megafinals across the country , each with say &num players in. the top players in the megafinal win trophies and qualify for a national gigafinal ( about &num , &num players ) . 
^ there is also a terafinal , a relatively small tournament featuring the best players in each age group from the gigafinal . 
^ the tournament has been sponsored in recent years by british land . 
^ i assume that it is financially healthy . 
^ i imagine that both the heats and the megafinal make a good profit , but i do n't know the details . 
^ &num could there by a &name go challenge ? 
^ clearly any &name go challenge would be on a very much smaller scale , and there might have to be other differences from how the chess event is organised . 
^ when i spoke to &name &name about the idea of a corresponding go event , he was very interested . 
^ he says that several schools have asked him if he can run some sort of event in the other terms of the school year , and he is reluctant to have anything too similar to his existing event so he said go was a definite possibility . 
^ &name &name does know about board games other than chess - i have seen articles he has written on chinese chess , for example - but i do n't think he knows a great deal about go . 
^ his main worry seems to be that it might be too complicated , the rules might be too difficult , and it might take too long to play . 
^ he was reassured to learn that you can play on board sizes smaller than 19x19 , so games do not always take such a long time to finish . 
^ anyway , he indicated that if we could come up with proposals for a go event that sounded ok to him , and an explanation of the rules that was sufficiently clear and simple , then he might be prepared to endorse the event and publicise it to his existing customer schools through his newsletters etc. he would not feel it necessary for huge numbers of schools to take part for it to be worth doing - from what he said , it sounded like he would regard something in the region of &num schools as a great success if it could be achieved ( he suggested that we should try to have just individual school heats and then a national final , for which the qualification criteria could be very lax ) . 
^ his strong preference was for something that would run in the &name &name ( not in the &name term as it would clash with the chess , and not in the &name term as he feels it is difficult to get something started right at the start of the school year ) . 
^ as the majority of the schools he deals with are primary schools , the problem of summer term exams should not be so big a difficulty . 
^ so the possible benefits are considerable . 
^ if we can set up this event , it would get advertised to around &num , &num schools . 
^ moreover , if it was endorsed by &name &name who organises the &name &name challenge which they all already compete in and enjoy , they would be more likely to show an interest . 
^ and these schools should all have the resources / ability to take part if they wish , as they have managed to organise themselves to take part in the chess event and find the entry fees for it . 
^ also this could fit in extremely well with &name . 
^ schools who do the &name &name &name who hear about go could be interested in &name visits to find out more . 
^ the downside is that it would require quite a bit of organisational effort , and we would n't want it to be a damp squib . 
^ &num what would we have to do next ? 
^ these are the things i think we would need to do next ( not necessarily listed in the right order ) if we are going to pursue this idea . 
^ i think perhaps the most important one is whether we can find a reasonable number of our existing contact schools who would be willing to take part ( this might depend on us making some changes to the format to make it more attractive to them ) . 
^ if we had say &num schools ( or junior clubs ) who we could sign up ( at least to running a heat if not travelling to a final ) , the whole thing would seem clearly viable from the start whereas if we had only &num or &num we would i think be heading for a big flop : 
^ a. . 
^ decide what changes we would want to make to the &name &name &name format ( e.g. should the heats last fewer weeks , should initially everyone be allowed to play in the finals ? ) . 
^ do we want to use the name " &name go &name " ( and are we allowed to ) ? 
^ would we use 13x13 go ? 
^ we might like to consult with our existing go school contacts and / or ask &name &name if he could tell us some of his contacts who he thinks might be interested to see if they can offer any advice . 
^ b. . 
^ decide what we would use as prizes , where we would get them from , how we would send them out , and how much it would cost . 
^ what else would we need to send out to the schools ( competition rules , pairing cards , etc ? ) ? 
^ c. . 
^ decide what the entry fees would be . 
^ d. . 
^ decide when the event would take place . 
^ could we do &name term &num ? 
^ assuming there is to be some sort of national final , where and when would it be ? 
^ e. . 
^ produce some easy go rules , preferably able to be understood by a teacher and children without ( much ) outside help . 
^ we would in my opinion definitely need to test these with some real beginners . 
^ f. . 
^ decide what we can offer schools in terms of help getting started . 
^ what equipment can we offer , at what price ( perhaps the stock of &name sets we have - partly in my garage and partly in &name - could help here ? ) ? 
^ how much would they have to pay for a &name visit or other visit by local go players ( have we got go players in different parts of the country who can help , to avoid too much travelling ? ; some sort of network of local contacts would definitely help ) ? 
^ we would need to avoid setting too high a financial barrier to entry ( if schools were likely to have to find an entry fee , payment for a visit and buy equipment ) . 
^ would schools who entered the event get &name &name schools membership thrown in ? 
^ g. . 
^ find out if it is possible to find any sponsorship money or other way of subsidising the event , at least at first while we try to generate interest ( one of my plans was that we might approach &name &name to see if there was any possibility of sponsorship from &name &name , but until the game they are currently working on comes out this is n't really possible and it is now i think very overdue ) . 
^ h. . 
^ plan some sort of web pages for the event ( who would write / maintain them ? ) . 
^ should we also have an &name meeting place / time ( on &name ? ) set up where new school contacts could come and practise etc. as it might be useful to people who are new to go ? 
^ i. . 
^ approach our existing contact schools and see how many we could sign up to taking part . 
^ j. . 
^ &name who is the team of people who would take this forward and actually organise the event . 
^ on the &num hand we are probably not talking about a big number of schools being involved but on the other hand this seems a large enough project to need some reasonably formal project / budget planning . 
^ k. . 
^ get back to &name &name once we had a good plan for most or all of the above and take it from there . 
^ see if he is happy with where we have got to . 
^ what do we want him to do for us ? 
^ what would our relationship ( financial and otherwise ) with his organisation be ? 
^ i think we would definitely want to get back to him &num way or another before the summer holidays are over .
