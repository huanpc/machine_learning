^ hi &name , 
^ i can only imagine the cacophany of ugly noises coming from your collective vocal-chords last night ! ! 
^ the very thought makes me shudder . 
^ &smiley 
^ i considered going to watch the varsity match on monday , but it 's actually my birthday , so i think i 'm going to do something here . 
^ i 'm sure &name and the boys will perform admirably though ! 
^ another funny thing - last match we were playing , apparently one of the opposition players thought i was a blue , and was about to complain because he thought i should n't have been playing ! 
^ thing is , it 's easy to look good when you 're playing against weak opposition - if i actually had to play against anyone who was half-decent , it would be very easy to tell that i 'm not actually that good ! 
^ still quite funny though . 
^ anyway , we lost the mixed semi-finals yesterday &num , even with &name playing . 
^ c' est la vie . 
^ &name , keep real , 
^ &char
