^ people , 
^ it is extremely important that you reply to this email within &num hours ( sorry for the capitalisation etc. , but it 's just to stress the gravity of this situation ) . 
^ okay , this is " the thing 
^ " the holiday has the opportunity to take place this summer from the 7th to the 13th of july . 
^ however , we need to book the cottage &name if we want this to go ahead as it wo n't sit around very long at all . 
^ so , i need to know now whether or not you can commit yourselves to this . 
^ the cost should be about &pound; &num between all of us an excellent bargain brought to us by &name &name ( it 's his extended family 's cottage ) . 
^ there is enough room . 
^ the cottage is about &num meters from the beach on the &name coast . 
^ &name knows lots to do in the area as his family has been there since the &name 
^ therefore we will be able to pursue a variety of activities which will hopefully suit everyone . 
^ so , please email or phone me , as the next steps will be being taken today or tomorrow . 
^ your friendly holiday co-ordinator ,
