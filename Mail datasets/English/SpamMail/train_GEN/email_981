^ &name this is useful . 
^ by the way , is there a general consensus on what we are all going to do about birthdays now ? 
^ i mean , we have been scattered far and wide . 
^ is it silly to try and send presents , or should we send &num present from all of us , or should we just send cards ? 
^ make known your thoughts , for it 's &name 's birthday on monday . 
^ &name to hear from you soon .
