^ dear sir or madam , 
^ i am writing to request permission to download the bigfix client from your site and distribute it ( completely free of charge and without any catches ) to friends and family to whom i am frequently providing technical support on a casual basis . 
^ as it is a free download from your site , i would simply be saving them the time and phone bill for the download . 
^ it would also , to a small extent , save your bandwidth . 
^ i need your explicit permission for this however as the license agreement forbids it . 
^ i look forward to hearing from you . 
^ with warm regards , 
^ &name &name
