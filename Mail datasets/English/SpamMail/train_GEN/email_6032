^ dear &name & &name , 
^ &name all is going well with you . 
^ i was just thinking that it might be good for us to get together shortly before &name to pray for the &name studies . 
^ not sure whether you 're both available before &num , but if you can make say &num , then i thought it would be nice to just pray together . 
^ i 'm guessing that &name & karuna will want to set up c2 at this time , so it 's probably best if we met to pray somewhere else ( how about my room ( y7 ) ? ) . 
^ let me know your thoughts ! 
^ love &name
