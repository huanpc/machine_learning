^ dear &name , 
^ thank you for this apology , which must count as the most fulsome i 've ever received ! 
^ i do n't complain about &name 's policy of not advertising &name events , but just about the rather blunt wording . 
^ &char slightly rewroked clause would raise fewer hackles . 
^ thank you for taking the trouble to respond to my worries . 
^ yours sincerely , 
^ &name &name &name of &name

^ dear sir , 
^ regarding your comment below : 
^ thank-your very much for your concern . 
^ may i apologise personally for any offence that may have been caused . 
^ &char worded the statement ( on advice from the &name executive , that such a clause should be included . ) if i have caused any offence , it was unwittingly and due above all to my inexperience in wording such clauses . 
^ as i understand it , the reason for the inclusion of the clause is to prevent any future misunderstanding as it is &name policy not to advertise events not organised by &name . 
^ we realise that this may seem unfair to others to whom we appeal to advertise our events . 
^ therefore we would like them to know beforehand that this is the policy so that they can choose not to help us , if they feel that is the best course of action . 
^ again , please may i apologise personally and accept full responsibility for any offence caused . 
^ please do not allow it to reflect unflatteringly upon the &name . 
^ the fault is all mine and due to my inexperience . 
^ please forgive me . 
^ thank-you for your understanding . 
^ in &name , &name &name ( &name &name ) &name &name &name publicity assistant . 
^ dear &name &name , 
^ i read your e-mail quite happily and cooperatively until i saw your parting comment about &name 's reciprocal arrangements and so forth . 
^ may i urge you to revise the wording of this remark , so as to give less offence to your readership ? 
^ yours sincerely ,
