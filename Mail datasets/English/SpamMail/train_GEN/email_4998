^ yeah , &name , i got your first email . 
^ i also got the one you included in the next email section . 
^ you just made it sound like you had sent me a barrage of emails so i thought i missed a few &smiley 
^ i think you might be on to something with the reverse speed of light theory . 
^ i do n't think &name even considered that piece . 
^ but amazingly , since he squares the speed of light ( &char ) in his famous formular : &char mc 
^2 , ( &char ) does n't affect his calculations at all so he probably did n't bother . 
^ but for our putposes , this point is crucial because since a lost email has no mass , this means that your renegade , &name travelling , space warping email moving at the negative speed of light must have infinite energy . 
^ with all this energy , of course it can go running around commiting evil acts like capturing other emails sent by you . 
^ the reprecussions of this might still be greater in the months to come . 
^ just imagine if this email ever becomes allied to &name ! 
^ i 'm nervous already . 
^ fine , be that way and refuse to share with me where we are staying in &name . 
^ i might just accentilly lose your train ticket . 
^ &name ! 
^ you got it insured . 
^ well , i might just have to become &name &name and lose my train ticket then . 
^ that 'll teach you . 
^ i 'll even be able to fly back from trieste on your extra flight ! 
^ &name &name . 
^ &name when i think i have made up my jet-lag , stupid &name has to move its clocks forward another hour . 
^ how is it &num : &num in the afternoon already ? 
^ &name

^ i 've given this good thought : 
^ my freaking fwd . 
^ &name flyer email spends all day riding the evil circle / district / metropolatin line . 
^ the line is &name slow that it manages to break the speed of light in reverse . 
^ so long story short ( because man is it a long story ) it can intercept any or all emails as it sees fit . 
^ &name in the past present and future of course . 
^ of course . 
^ well , being that my words are incredibly prescious , i 've cut and paste my email that has n't seemed to send to the bottom of this . 
^ that 's so weird that emails do n't go to you ! 
^ soooo ... &name , &char emailed &name ( my bro bro 's best friend from college who lives there with her austrian husband . ) asking her for suggestions .. she emailed back insisting we stay with them . 
^ so it 's settled . 
^ the guys name is &name ? 
^ &name and &name . 
^ sort of a funny story . 
^ &char looked sooo much and could n't find any good deals . 
^ so i went to this last minute website , made a bid type deal ( sort of but not really ) and ended up with . ... actually i think i 'll hold you in suspense for a bit . 
^ : &char the hotel looks ok ... but not as good as the &name boat . 
^ alrighty this is going to be sooooooo long with the cut and pasted email so i 'll call it quits . 
^ i 'll give you crap about your lack of home internet lataz " . 
^ __________ next email_____ : &char hey &name , 
^ dragons . 
^ mmm . 
^ this is a solid reason to go to &name . 
^ but i do n't know if we have time to do all of the stuff you 've mentioned . 
^ we have our train passes though , so i think we can play it by ear with that . 
^ that 's great that both schools were so appealing . 
^ the hardest decision i 'd say would be the 'should i get the phd " dilemna . 
^ you ca n't really go wrong with either school so try not to stress about that ! 
^ i 've heard that &name is beautiful . 
^ did you get to see your broseph and his girlfriend ? 
^ it 's been such a good time with my girlies . 
^ i just dropped them off at heathrow this afternoon and my room is so empty ! 
^ it was very chill . 
^ we did n't try to squeeze in to much because it was more about seeing each other . 
^ sooo much fun though . 
^ we each purchased sparkly rings for each other , got down on our knees in the store and proposed . 
^ it was quite emotional . 
^ i think the cashier cried . 
^ ; &char i feel like i 'm running some sort of a boarding house though . 
^ &name the g-d sister &num weeks ago , then jessi and &name , now ( in roughly &num min . ) &name the other g-d sister on her way back to cananda . 
^ so i 'm sorry that i have n't had time to check out the hostel hotel situation ! ! ! 
^ i promise i will be good for something and do that ! 
^ ; &char it 's just been crazy hectic as i 'm sure it has been for you . 
^ did you ever get our train passes delivered to your house ? 
^ yawn yawn- soo tired . 
^ &name home is &name " nice , &name
