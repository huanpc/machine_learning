^ hi &name , thanks so much for the continuing saga of &name 's university life . 
^ you do seem to have a great time over there . 
^ funny though - as far as the cooking goes , i always thought that you were a great cook . 
^ at least that 's what your mom has been telling us . 
^ i reread psalm &num and it is a great one 
^ - a little overwhelming though to really think of how well &name knows each of us . 
^ and sometimes we think we have our own secrets - not from &name ! 
^ we had a great visit with your mom last month . 
^ it was so nice to see her and spend the day with her . 
^ it is so wonderful to have friends that you just pick up and carry on from the last time you saw them . 
^ that 's the way it is with your family . 
^ we had a great time discussing another trip to &name next summer . 
^ &name and &name are planning to take time off work to do it if it all comes together . 
^ i did n't think that we would ever all go there again , so it is definitely something to look forward to again . 
^ everyone is fine here . 
^ &name will be finished his course at christmas so is applying for jobs now . 
^ it is hard to believe that he will be out working soon . 
^ &name is busy with the swim team and reach for the &name and has a job lifeguarding and teaching swimming . 
^ &name is also on the swim team and has a job at the pool as a change room attendant . 
^ he says that it &char kind of boring but an easy way to make money . 
^ he also does some work in a book warehouse once a week lifting boxes so he is building muscle ( also working out at home ) . 
^ &name and i are both fine - enjoying our jobs and home life . 
^ our mothers are both about the same and life goes on . 
^ well i should go and get something done around here on my day off work . 
^ take care and good luck at focusing and getting your work done . 
^ love &name and boys
