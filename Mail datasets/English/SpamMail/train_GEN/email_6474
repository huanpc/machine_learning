^ dear friends , 
^ to advertise the &name i thought that it would be good to publicly kidnap &name &name . 
^ i would like your help . 
^ this will involve a black suit + white shirt / blouse ( no tie of any sort needed ) water pistols ( or some other form of fake gun ) and shades ( you know - sunglasses ) it also might need some rehearsal we 'll see about this once &name has agreed to his kidnapping . 
^ if you do n't have shades then please go to your coolest friend ( the one that is so cool that they even wear sunglasses in the winter ) and borrow some . 
^ if none of your friends are that cool then get back to me and i 'll see if i can find some cheap shades . 
^ i do n't suppose that anybody has any gun of any sort ? 
^ and maybe not even your silliest friend has one . 
^ i 'll see what can be done about that . 
^ do write back if you are too busy or wo n't be at the &name , &name
