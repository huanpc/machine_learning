^ hi &name , 
^ i would be happy to check and see what kind of flexibility there is with the starting date if you like . 
^ if you are interested in pursuing this a little further - what would be the earliest reasonable time for you to be in &name ? 
^ was there a particular program you were interested in , or should i check on both programs ? 
^ on the other hand - i do n't want to be pushing you into this , as there may be many reasons to stay in the &name ; just wanted to make you aware of the opportunity . 
^ ca n't really be considered as much of a " job " opportunity for the financial gain , as the compensation you 'll receive will be largely consumed up by the airline fare . 
^ the decision to apply would have to be based almost solely on the ministry experience and training , and the benefits of otherwise spending a summer in &name .

^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for passing on the information . 
^ i had just about decided to apply when i noticed the dates - starting on june 10th . 
^ &name this is a major problem , as i do n't finish term until the 22nd june . 
^ and i was so very excited about this too . 
^ still , i think it would not be appropriate to miss the last few weeks of term , and graduation too . 
^ i 'm really sorry . 
^ &name , thanks so much for the information though . 
^ as i said , i was really caught up with the idea . 
^ and it almost seems like this would be my last chance as well to work for a long period over the summer . 
^ &name . 
^ &name , thanks so much ! 
^ lots of love to you all , and i hope the swimming is going well !
