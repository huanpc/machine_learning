^ hi everyone 
^ yesterday at &num o' clock we initiated the factorisation of a large number , consisting of prime factors having the following sizes : 
^ &num , &num , &num , &num . 
^ we managed to connect over &num clients simultaneously , for a period of over &num hours , and no problems turned up with the &name this time . 
^ thanks to everyone who connected a client . 
^ going through trial division , &name rho and elliptic curve method successfully , turned up the following factorisation : 
^ factorisation ( &num ) 
^ prime [ &num , &num ] , composite [ &num ] 
^ the quadratic sieve method started about &num / &num o' clock , and continued until this morning at &num : &num a.m. although it has turned up no factors ( yet ) it seems to have entered into an infinite loop , or just one that is very long . 
^ the last message printed by quadratic &name , was at &num a.m. , so no more messages were produced for the last &num hours and &num minutes ! 
^ this message was : 
^ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * trial dividing &num numbers , queue items left &num * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
^ &num / &num relations , &num partial relations . 
^ averages now : &num ms / relation , &num ms / partial relation . 
^ estimated running time : &num minutes , so &num minutes left maximum . 
^ &char &num &num trial divisons left in queue . 
^ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * trial dividing &num numbers , queue items left &num * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
^ &num / &num relations , &num partial relations . 
^ averages now : &num ms / relation , &num ms / partial relation . 
^ estimated running time : &num minutes , so &num minutes left maximum . 
^ &char &num &num trial divisons left in queue . 
^ the &name logs show that the server had no work units left to send out , since this time . 
^ &name we can figure out what the problem is here . 
^ the log files are on my website : &website / you will need to unzip them twice ! 
^ note that i am using the version that was in the repository at &num p.m. last night , and i know that &name has made some changes since then . 
^ cheers
