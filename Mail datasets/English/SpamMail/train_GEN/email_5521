^ dear all , 
^ there has been a cut in the budget available for sunday night movies , so that we are now only able to get the films ( no food ) , starting from this sunday . 
^ the current plans are to have one-off nights where food and drinks will be available ( probably once or twice a term ) . 
^ this decision was taken by the &name executive ( not me ) to reflect the overall &name budget allowances . 
^ do n't miss the films starting at &name tomorrow ( &name park " and " city of &name " ) , and the &name specials , chosen by &name ( our &name president ) will be shown on sunday 3rd november &num ( next week ) , starting at &name , as follows : 
^ &num . 
^ sleepy hollow , and &num . 
^ the &name &name &name . 
^ i 'll do some research and send out a synopsis for each of the films by the end of this week . 
^ &name &name &name &name &name
