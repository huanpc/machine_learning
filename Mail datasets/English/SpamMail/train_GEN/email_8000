^ from : &name &name subject : fwd : my ppr ( fwd ) 
^ hey guys , so my friend &name &name in the social studies dept was really drunk saturday night , and he got an email from his tutorial leader about the &name paper he 's working on ( the email is at the bottom of this message) . 
^ he then , of course , proceeded to immediately write back , and since then his masterful reverie has become quasi-legendary , making its way to dozens of people as well as the fm office . 
^ it 's just about the funniest thing i 've read this year . 
^ i guess some of you might have gotten already , but it never hurts to read it twice . 
^ i emphasize that this is totally for real , and he 's still trying to patch things up with the &name . 
^ enjoy !

^ phineas - i will certainly admit that i am drunk while writing this email . 
^ however , i am sufficiently interested in social theory to be able to engage your questions about my thesis - i hope . 
^ maybe not . 
^ maybe not because i am drunk . 
^ but that is ok . 
^ here we go : 
^ so , i think the main point of my paper so far is that ( it is hard remembering) . 
^ well ( i think it is . 
^ i am trying to engage &name on both a philosophical and literary level - because he blurs the line between those &num disciplines , and that particular melange interests me . 
^ deeply . 
^ it interests me a lot , is what i intend to say . 
^ so let me tell you . 
^ the paper goes " like this " if you will - and only if you will - 
^ &num dimensions : space . 
^ &name about it , man ! ! 
^ &name is like space it 's &num ! ! ! 
^ it is all over the place man ! ! 
^ serious ! 
^ according to &name , it influences every important discursive relationship . 
^ but wait , man . 
^ just wait . 
^ sexuality - hell , it 's like a plane - it 's &num ! ! 
^ why ? 
^ well , let me break it down man . 
^ so like , power is everywhere 
^ - it 's all over the place - but sexuality - like , it 's constructed and all , i admit that fully . 
^ but if you think about it - just think about it man - it 's like , power is still in control man , so like sexuality is only &num but power is like full on fucking &num man . 
^ &name . 
^ is n't this an awesome paper so far ? 
^ so if yout hink about it some far you &name can get to the first dimension &char , an ! 
^ yeah man , i 'm &char alking about line . 
^ &name , the line is only &num d. so if you hink about it all the techniqiues and tech nologies and crazy ass relationships are like lines . 
^ and they make up the planes . 
^ but even more than that they make up the space man . 
^ so it all goes frtom &num . 
^ that 's what my [ aper is like man . 
^ it 's simple as &name man ! ! ! ! ! 
^ &num ! ! ! 
^ &name . . ... 
^ so the other interesting thing is subjectivity . 
^ do you know what that is ? 
^ &name let me tell you - it 's not space , plane , or line - it 's a point man . 
^ do you know that points do n't even exist ? ! ? ? ! ? ! ? ! ? 
^ they do n't ! ! ! ! 
^ serious ! 
^ it 's like what &name sayu about the subject . 
^ he 's not th ere man ! ! 
^ you thini you 're all that and shit , like i 'm a bag of chips , i 'm &name that , i 'm a " subject " but &char an , you are nothing - you 're a point , which is npothing man ! ! ! 
^ can you believe it ? ! 
^ i hope yuout think this paper is as awesome as it really is . 
^ in reality , it is the most inventive , original , fantastical , quasi-quixotical paper - it is &name and a half manb - you are going to be so impressed with me and like me . 
^ thanks &name 
^ &name sat , &num &name &num , &name &name wrote : 
^ &name i found the &num paragraphs enticing and intelligent . 
^ it is hard to give you much substantive feedback because it ends with a thesis that sounds fascinating but i ca n't discern the argument enough to say much . 
^ this seems to be the thesis : if we are to understand what a subject is or how one can exist in the foucaultian schematic of discursive strategies , it is not to resistance but to space that we must appeal . 
^ for it is only through space that resistance becomes at all " subjective . " 
^ a few questions do come to mind . 
^ are you criticizing &name for his emphasis on a discursively constituted social reality ? 
^ how does the panoticon fit in ? 
^ it seems like it should . 
^ i will only be around in the morning on monday . 
^ i have to work at my daycare coop in the afternoon ( nothing kicks my ass more than chasing &num two-year olds around) .
