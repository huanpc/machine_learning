^ although i have several yeas of experience with &name in its several variants i am an absolute newbie to the world of &name . 
^ so to get started i am looking for &num things : 
^ &num a tutorial that will walk me through a typical project . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that is in the works at the moment . 
^ i have put together a quick start guide , but have added some new material which based on the latest features , so this has delayed its release . 
^ the other challenge is to keep with all the added new features &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ &num a feature list that will allow me to see what &name has as compared to the other products available .

^ 
^ &num a pdf version of the manual . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name has only recently addded some features which greatly help speed up composing longer documents like a manual . 
^ my aim is to release the docs for &name &num as a fully interactive &name - all created natively with &name . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name it is described as being " like quark or &name " but since these products are quite different that is not a sufficient description . 
^ my first impression is that it is closer to the capabiities of quark . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ it may share many concepts in the menu structure like &name , but in my experience with documenting &name , its &name &name features in power and ease of use are only matched by &name &num , so it has elements of both &name . 
^ exporting directly from &name is not its strength &name . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ from my experience supporting &name users professionally , &name has done a brilliant job of masking a great deal of the complexity of creating high quality &name , without handcuffing advanced users . 
^ &name &name with &name , &name etc , is often fraught with errors for many users .

^ you might be interested to see this : &website 
^ i think it is important to appreciate that &name is still a young and quickly developing project , which is entirely made of volunteers . 
^ i am of the mind there is a place for both &name and &name . 
^ we are lucky to have both freely available with active development and support . 
^ regards ,
