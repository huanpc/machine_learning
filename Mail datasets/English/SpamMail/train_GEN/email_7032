^ hi &name 
^ hope you 're well and term 's treating you well . 
^ as you almost certainly know , the concert is on saturday and so there 's not much time left now ! 
^ we are however just a little short of stewards . 
^ i was therefore just wondering whether there is anyone in your cu who 'd like to help on the day as a steward ? 
^ basically it just involves moving chairs and things about during the day ( although not all stewards need to do this ) and then in the evening , setting up , ushering people in , checking tickets , checking everyone is ok , clearing up etc. etc. it is n't too strenuous and is often quite enjoyed by those who do it . 
^ it 's also very much an on-the-day job , so is n't a big commitment . 
^ if there is anybody who would like to do this ( or have further questions ) then if they could contact me by e-mail , that would be grand . 
^ many thanks , 
^ love &name 
^ &name . 
^ on the houseparty you took a photo of me up on the peaks - i was just wondering if it came out ok & whether it 'd be possible to have a copy , since i do n't think i 've got one of that area ( despite having been up there a number of times ) and i rather like the peaks . 
^ thanks !
