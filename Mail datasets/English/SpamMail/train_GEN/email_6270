^ hello and happy wednesday ! 
^ here 's the &name prayer points as promised . 
^ even if you 're not using them tonight it 'd be good if you could tell your college groups all about &name at some point if you have n't already ! 
^ if you have a &name team member in your group you could ask them to explain about it , or if you are a team member you 'll know yourself , or alternatively look at the termcard or in the &name guide for more explanation . 
^ it would be great also if you could advertise at some point , whether tonight at some other point that the harrys team could do with new team members , particularly people who are n't graduating this year . ... they 're not short at the moment , but t' would be good to have a few more ppl involved before the vast majority disappear this summer ! 
^ here 's the prayer points , use what you can . 
^ and hopefully see you in the morning ! 
^ &name xx 
^ * &name &name that the bible studies have been well attended this term , and there is a core of internationals who are truly seeking to know more about &name . 
^ pray for the remaining studies of the term , that they would be faithful to &name 's word and that many would come to hear this . 
^ * &name &name that we have a group of regulars who are forming close relationships with members of the team , pray that these friendships will be genuine and would become a way tto dhare the good news of &name &name . 
^ * pray that the team would be one in spirit and purpose , seeking to glorify &name through his work in us , giving him free reign over our live , and that people with a desire to serve &name in &name 's would come forward and join up . 
^ * pray that preparations for the christmas party would go well and that this would be further opportunities to share &name 's love in &name &name 
^ * pray above all that &name would graciously use &name 's coffee bar to lead to the salvation of some of those who come . 
^ * pray that booking guests into formal hall each week will not be a problem . 
^ &name , don;t know if you want to include this bit , but here 's a bit about some internationals we;ve seen lots of this term , have also attached this week 's prayer list , so you can see if there 's anything suitable in there too ! 
^ people : pray for &char from &name . 
^ &name &name for her enthusiasm to know more about him , and that he would work through &name 's, alpha and friendships to reveal himself to her , bringing her to a caving faith in &name &name ! 
^ for &char , &char , &char , &char and &char from &name , thank &name for the friendships they 've made in the team , and pray that their interest in christianity would cease to be simply cultural , but would lead them to real knowledge of the father . 
^ for &char ( &name ) he 's been friends with some of the team for years ( ! ) but has very little interest in christianity . 
^ pray that the team would not be complacent in exlaining the gospel to him after so long , and that he would ultimately respond to what &name is offering him .
