^ hey &name , 
^ it 's great to hear from you &smiley 
^ yeah , sandbox definitely went downhill last year ; and now that it is no longer free , the decision to leave was easy . 
^ so this year we are trying &name for the first time ... we 'll see how it goes . 
^ the league is shaping up to have some quality players ... it should be interesting to see how it ends up &smiley 
^ yes , i am still at &name . 
^ definitely having a good time , but i 'm not exactly keeping up with the papers in the database field . 
^ hopefully i 'll be able to catch up next year . 
^ i also got into &org so the decision is pretty much between there and &name . 
^ &name is obviously better for databases , but i wonder if that might change in the future . 
^ but i will be going to &name next weekend , and hopefully the decision will become easier . 
^ yeah , &name &name gave me those stats about admissions after i received notification from &name that i had been rejected . 
^ i definitely appreciated that she ( and you ) took the time to let me know . 
^ how is graduate life treating you ? 
^ are you working on stream ? 
^ are you working with dr. &name ? 
^ &name all is well , &name

^ hey &name , thanks for dropping a line . 
^ we 'll see how fantasy baseball goes . 
^ i prefer sandbox 's draft by position . 
^ unfortunately they dropped their free fantasy baseball this yr . 
^ they 've been going downhill . 
^ are you still in &name ? 
^ how are things over there ? 
^ i hope you are having a great time and traveling all over &name . 
^ so you are going to &name next yr right ? 
^ both this and last yr &name cs had about &num apps . 
^ last yr accepted 60ish and 35ish came . 
^ this year they clamped it down to &num admits hoping for 30ish coming . 
^ so it was pretty rough this year . 
^ are you going to next weekend 's &name visit ? 
^ if you are , you 'll probably run into my friend &name &name ( also from &name ) . 
^ take care , &name .
