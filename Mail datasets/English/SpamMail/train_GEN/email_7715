^ a colleague forwarded information about the talk " supporting those who suffer from eating disorders " that will be given by &name &name on friday &num feb. 
^ i am currently a health services research fellow in my second year of a phd in the faculty of clinical medicine . 
^ my research is on the psychology of eating disorders and i am looking to recruit a number of people who duffer with eating disorders to take part in my studies . 
^ the &name &name association are willing to support my research and will contact their members to ask for volunteers to participate in my studies .
