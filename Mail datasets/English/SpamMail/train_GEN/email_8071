<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

^ how are things ? 
^ &name that your festivities were festive enough to sacrifice a cow ; esp that &name brought you everything you could ever want plus a little bit extra in case you should ever break something 
</text_embedded>

^ santa brought me nothing , the selfish , lazy , fat bastard . 
^ &name , on the other hand , was very generous . 
^ in fact , he 's still being very generous ( or will be this weekend ) since i have christmas from &name vouchers to collect upon . 
^ &smiley so , yes , i got lots of nice things that i wanted or never knew that i wanted " til i got them . 
^ yourself ? 
^ oh , i did n't sacrifice any cows though . 
^ sorry . 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name &name . 
^ you must remember that &name does n't give presents to naughty girls , and i 'm not going to finish this sentence just in case i get myself into trouble . 
^ what do you propose to spend your vouchers on ? 
^ are they those annoying &num which you have to redeem in a certain shop , but said shop is full of crap ? 
^ maybe they 're special &num . 
^ my presents were cool - useful things like lots of &name and jungle socks . 
^ and i got my presents ( well , the third attempt ) from sister last night which was nice 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ and to answer your question , i 'm not too bad . 
^ i was actually doing okay until today , as it happens : for some reason , despite having been tired enough to fall soundly asleep by about &num : &num last night , i woke up at &num : 30am and did n't get back to sleep again . 
^ which made today .. erm .. interesting . 
^ &num lectures in a row , an hour for lunch , then a &num hour practical lab . 
^ not nice . 
^ i have another lab tomorrow too . 
^ sucky sucky .

</text_embedded>

^ i do n't live in &name , no. nor &name for that matter . 
^ what are you 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ it was the american &name . 
^ &name . 
^ seriously though , i 'm sure part of &name burnt down - think it was the old bit , but then maybe you 're too posh for that . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ talking about anyway ? 
^ there was a fire in &name though . 
^ some shop / restaurant or something on regent &name . 
^ that was last week i think .

<text_normal>

^ is dull - though definitely should be panicing as there is moooch to do . 
</text_embedded>

^ getting all set for &name , are we ? 
^ remember to leave a wee &name shaped space in your luggage . 
^ he 's just itching to get away on holiday somewhere . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ given the amount of crap i have to take , i might just be able to take a ( small ) vial of &name " wee , not a wee &name . 
^ &name is he ? 
^ he should see a doctor . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ he was all chuffed yesterday &name he 's been asked to go to the &name lab in &name park ( somewhere near &name maybe ? ) which he was calling his first travel assignment . 
^ but then he found out today that &name &name ( another new start ) is being sent to the &name , ha ha . 
^ so he was a bit pissed off ... &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ would you trust &name as a ambassador of the &name ? 
^ but then this &name &name chappy has a crap name ( well , &num first names which ca n't be right ) so maybe they should send &name instead . 
^ gets him out of the office for a bit &smiley
