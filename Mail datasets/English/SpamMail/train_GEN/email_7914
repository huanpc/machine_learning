^ hi &name , 
^ i 've found matchbox &num but have n't found mad season yet but am sure it can be found as i 'm told that they have only got &num &name 's out . 
^ not too much happening here , weather pretty good , &name has still got his cold although it 's almost gone now , he 's just got a croaky voice and at times has not been able to talk . 
^ is that a miracle or what ? ? ? 
^ we 're flying over to &name on july 12th and arrive in the early am of july 13th and are going up to the &name on july 17th . 
^ look forward to seeing you either in &name or the &name . 
^ will be in touch later .

^ i tried to get a hold of your dad at the weekend to find out if you were finished with exams or still had more to go . 
^ but he 's a hard person to get a hold of . 
^ anyway hope all of your exams are over now and you are just enjoying yourself . 
^ i 'm sure you 've done quite well . 
^ are you getting a summer job in the south or will it be &name again ? 
</text_embedded>

^ he was away hillwalking ( not sure where ) with &name this weekend . 
^ well , on sunday at least , but he left on saturday sometime . 
^ my exams finished on thursday ( 7th ) just in time for me to vote . 
^ but unfortunately there is n't an &name candidate roundabout here , so it was a bit of a let-down really . 
^ i was a bit ill for the second half of my exams and after them , so i have n't really done anything since then . 
^ and my friend &name does n't finish her exams until today ( in about &num and a quarter hours ... ) so i 'm waiting for her , really . 
^ i do n't know where i 'll be working this summer yet . 
^ if i can get an internship here then i 'll be staying in &name , otherwise i 'll be going home . 
^ but i 'd rather not go back to &name again ... 
<text_embedded> 

^ we 're planning of coming over for just over &num weeks , leaving &name on july 12th , arriving &name on the 13th and spending a few days with &name before going up to the &name . 
^ nothing booked yet but that 's the plan . 
</text_embedded>

^ okay . 
^ i was asking dad about that last night , actually , when he phoned . 
^ or did you already know that ? 
^ so if i am still in &name then i 'll probably be able to come to &name to see you while you 're both there . 
^ oh , and can i be really cheeky and ask you to look for some cds for me ? 
^ actually it 's only one really : i 'd really like matchbox &num - mad &name , but i would n't mind hearing anything by them if you can still get cheap cds over with you . 
<text_embedded> 

^ the weather here is really hot but it was quite cold up till a couple of weeks ago . 
^ last weekend was our first nice weekend in a while so we finally got some gardening done . 
^ &name is quite poorly with a sore throat and cold and feeling quite sorry for himself . 
</text_embedded>

^ all our good weather disappeared as soon as our exams finished , which was a bit of a pain . 
^ but i 'm sure it 'll get better for &name ... maybe ... is &name 's cold left over from the cold weather then ? 
^ tell him he 'd better get better before he comes over here , &name we do n't want him spreading any germs ... 
<text_embedded> 

^ anyway , i 've got to go now as i 've got to make some phonecalls before it gets too late . 
^ will be in touch shortly . 
</text_embedded>

^ okay . 
^ hmmm. &name 've just looked at this email and it seems much longer than i usually write . 
^ that 's probably &name i have absolutely nothing to do now that exams are finished , and our new cleaner showed up at about &num : &num this morning with her little son for the second week in a row . 
^ i 'm sure she should n't be allowed to do that . 
^ and someone had done something weird to our security lock which meant she could n't let herself in so i had to get out of bed and let her in. anyway , i 'll stop complaining now .
