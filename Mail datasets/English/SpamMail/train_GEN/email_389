^ here is the definitive list : 
^ &num ) the " i am soooo irritated i will constantly frown and grit my teeth in a menacing fashion do n't you dare come within &num metres of me or i will rip your tongue out with my bare hands because the world is full of people who annoy me . 
^ do i need any other excuse ? " 
^ &num ) the " i will nod my head at you slowly and draw my eyebrows together sardonically and smile really patronisingly because i am so infinitely superior to you , a lowly mortal , bow to the goddess " 
^ &num ) the " if you will put your hand on my forhead i guess i haev no chance but to move forward in a rather scray but very very funny manner while emitting noises like a cow in labour " 
^ &num ) the " if you will come and interrupt me while i am reading pride and pred / watching neighbours / doing anything , actually , then you ca n't really expect me to come and help you with a good grace . 
^ or any grace at all , not forgetting the loud sighs , eye rolling and death stare . 
^ be afraid , be very very afraid . " 
^ &num ) the " i know you 're trying to have a serious argument with me but quite frankly , you are so ludicrous that every time you say anything i just dissolve into hysterical giggles . 
^ oh , i know how infuriated it makes you , that 's exactly why i do it , person of limited intelligence " 
^ &num ) the " i know you 're trying to have a conversation with me , but to be honest , i 'm only standing here listening to you until someone more interesting comes along which is why i keep glancing over your shoulder adn making small noises which sound a lot like " hmmm " . " 
^ that 's all , folks . 
^ love &name xxxxxxxxxxx
