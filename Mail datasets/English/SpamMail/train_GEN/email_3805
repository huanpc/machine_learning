^ &name , this concerns a birthday present for &name . 
^ &char and some others would like to get &name a hockey stick ( &name 's idea ) as he 's taken up hockey , has n't got a great stick and the one i want to get him will have a sentimental angle as it 's the &num &name and i have and it 's kind of symbolic of a certain standard ( yes , village , ho , ho .. ) 
^ so , if you want to chip in and get your own bit of credit for it , please email asap . 
^ &pound; &num each ( it should be about &pound; &num ) 
^ if you want to do your own thing , that 's fine , just email me to say that . 
^ i 'm assuming the following are in : 
^ &name &name myself &name &name 
^ if you think anyone else would like to be " in " and is not on the list , get them to tell me asap . 
^ i will buy the stick no matter what by the end of the week . 
^ thanks all and have a nice day , 
^ &name
