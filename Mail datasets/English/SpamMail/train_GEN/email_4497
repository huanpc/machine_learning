^ hi &name , 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ is your brother going to stand for captain for next year ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i think he wants to . 
^ think he would do a good job . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ do you find that you are writing to yourself or your maybe your future self ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that 's a very good question . 
^ i often think about that when i 'm writing . 
^ i write stuff that i definitely would n't want people to know about . 
^ i suppose i 'm sort-of thinking that i might be able to give people certain extracts to read , so when i 'm writing , i 'm partially thinking that someone might read it in the future . 
^ however , mostly i do feel like i 'm writing to a future 'me " . 
^ i am fairly ( even painfully ) honest in the diary , but i know there are things that i do n't even want to put into writing about myself , let alone risk the chance of anyone else finding out ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ anyway mate , sorry if this email is a bit depressing . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name , do n't worry at all - you are talking to &name " what is the meaning of life " &name . 
^ i struggle with this stuff all the time . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i think maybe i have too much time to think at the moment . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yeah , i have to be pretty careful that i do n't think myself into depression - when i 'm on my own for long periods of time , i have to be especially careful . 
^ i 've had some tough times like that recently , especially when i 'm here outside of term time , and there are n't that many people around . 
^ yes , i think girls do have the power to provide serious distraction ( ! ) , but i guess at some point the questions are going to come up again . 
^ in some ways life is inevitably uncertain . 
^ life is such a strange thing - it can feel so different at different times , and seems to be full of these seemingly unanswerable questions . 
^ most of my songs are about questioning of various kinds . 
^ part of the reason i 'm writing the diary is because i feel like this is quite a " transitional " time for me , in my growing-up and thinking processes . 
^ i really have been through some near-rock-bottom times recently , and i guess i find myself clinging onto the belief that there is a &name who will make things right in the end , and who actually cares about me - sometimes it feels like there is n't much else . 
^ then sometimes i 'll feel fantastic , and full of life and energy ( like when i scored my first hockey goal the other day ! ) and everything will seem great . 
^ that 's the way of things i suppose . 
^ i will be thinking and praying about you and &name . 
^ i sympathise with what you 're going through at the moment . 
^ so , some deep and muddled responses from me . 
^ i 've got plenty more where they came from , but that is another ( long ) story ! 
^ i 'm actually in the lab right now , and i 'm going to do some work i think . 
^ my housemate has been keeping me up recently as her room is above mine and she has a friend staying at the moment . 
^ their social hours seem to be between midnight and about &num in the morning . 
^ it 's driving me insane . 
^ anyway , keep well &name , and keep searching , 
^ &name
