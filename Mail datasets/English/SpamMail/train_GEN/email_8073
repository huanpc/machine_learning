^ &name 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name &name , 
<text_embedded> 

^ &name ( in that intensely annoying manner that &name &name excels at . 
^ &name &name &name . 
^ indeed ! ) 
</text_embedded>

^ i have a headache . 
^ i 'd really rather not . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ fine . 
^ your loss . 
^ perhaps . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ but &char is a very special letter . 
^ i do n't think you should curse something just &name * you * do n't quite understand it ... &smiley 
^ &name point . 
^ &name am i feeling stupid now . 
^ what a frilly silly boy i am . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ i 've never seen frills on any of your shorts . 
^ do you wear frilly underwear .. ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ well , today is friday , so no 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name &name . 
^ you must remember that &name does n't give presents to naughty girls , and i 'm not going to finish this sentence just in case i get myself into trouble . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'm bad . 
^ i admit that . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ admission is the first step to getting somewhere . 
^ obviously . 
^ now what ? 
^ yes . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ what do you propose to spend your vouchers 
<text_embedded> 

^ on ? 
^ are they those annoying &num which you have to redeem in a certain shop , but said shop is full of crap ? 
^ maybe they 're special &num . 
</text_embedded>

^ they 're special &name vouchers i.e. not crappy papery things but just the mutual understnading that he owes me one bike-shaped christmas present . 
^ my bike 's knaxed . 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i assume that to annoy &name the most you 'll be going bike shopping with &name ? 
^ expensive bikes make stunts and tricks , well , more expensive ( but they will piss &name off ) 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ my presents were 
<text_embedded> 

^ cool - useful things like lots of &name and jungle socks . 
</text_embedded>

^ what 's &name ? 
^ and why do you need socks in the jungle ? 
^ surely it 's too warm for socks in the jungle ? 
^ or are these , like , mosquito socks or something .. ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name &char , &name &name socks ? 
^ - &name do n't wear socks ! 
^ the only thing i 'm giving mosquitos is a liberal soaking of &char , &name to kill their sorry little asses . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ and i got my presents ( well , the third 
<text_embedded> 

^ attempt ) from sister last night which was nice 
</text_embedded>

^ third attempt at a present ? 
^ so what was it ? 
^ do n't you know &name 's maxims for dialogue , boy ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ should i ? 
^ what tangible benefits do they bring to life ? 
^ who was &name ? 
^ was he subject to numerous cruel rhymes ? 
^ &name were leech-proof boxershorts , plus a mini-travel-game-set-thingy . 
^ i should point out that next do n't market their boxershorts as leech-proof , but they look sufficiently tight to make my ass look good . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ and to answer your question , i 'm not too bad . 
^ i was actually doing okay until today , as it happens : for some reason , despite having been tired enough to fall soundly asleep by about &num : &num last night , i woke up at &num : 30am and did n't get back to sleep again . 
^ which made today .. erm .. interesting . 
^ &num lectures in a row , an hour for lunch , then a &num hour practical lab . 
^ not nice . 
^ i have another lab tomorrow too . 
^ sucky sucky . 
^ this term is so much more work than last , and that was bad enough . 
^ hmph. enough bitching . 
^ although i 'm fucking good at it ... 
</text_embedded>

^ &name 
</text_embedded>

^ bitch . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ touchy . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ it was the american &name . 
^ &name . 
^ seriously though , i 'm sure part of &name burnt down - think it was the old bit , but then maybe you 're too posh for that . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name , that rings a beel now that you mention it . 
^ i think the old part is the good , expensive , fashionable part though , is n't it ? 
^ in any case , i do n't live there and have not burned down . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ talking about anyway ? 
^ there was a fire in &name though . 
^ some shop / restaurant or something on regent &name . 
^ that was last week i think . 
^ &name was hurt i do n't think . 
^ dammit . 
^ pain is good . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ that 's a pretty evil thing to say , &name . 
^ or something . 
^ &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ would you trust &name as a ambassador of the &name ? 
</text_embedded>

^ well , no. ( &name , &name , but no. ) but of * &name * , yes . 
^ &smiley 
^ but 
<text_embedded> 

^ then this &name &name chappy has a crap name ( well , &num first names which ca n't be right ) so maybe they should send &name instead . 
^ gets him out of the office for a bit &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ you 'd think they 'd * want * to get him out of the office for a bit , would n't you ? 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ only until you cc 'd this to &name ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ but anyway , i think &name &name is a nice name . 
^ but , no , &name , i still do n't think he 's fanciable . 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ we do , do n't we &name . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

^ for the whole weekend or the week or what ? 
</text_embedded>

^ yes .

^ &name ... arriving when ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ too many questions . 
^ no answers . 
^ just plain , hearty goulash .

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ and when do you finally bugger off on a plane ? 
</text_embedded>
