^ hey &name , 
^ how are you feeling today ? 
^ is life a joyful event for you ? 
^ hmmmm. i 'm at home for the weekend . 
^ lovely sunny weather up here in &name . 
^ &name is regaining consciousness thanks to a new disk . 
^ yesterday at work i went on a visit to that well-known haunt of mine ; &name university &name department ... normally it 's students who visit industry , but the other way round is just as appealing since it meant i did n't have to get up early to go in to work yesterday . 
^ i have started my revision ( ! ) and am now pushing back the frontiers of my knowledge , daily . 
^ how 's your preparation going ? 
^ hope you have a nice time with &name this weekend . 
^ enjoy swimming , and do n't worry too much about all the environmental health hazards in communal swimming pools . 
^ i 'm sure they 're exaggerated . 
^ anyway , must go and get my hair cut . 
^ have a good day . 
^ &name
