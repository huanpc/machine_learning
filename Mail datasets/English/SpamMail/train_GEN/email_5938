^ hi &name ! 
^ &name the concert went well on saturday- i 'm sorry to have missed it &smiley thanks for your comments , &name ... i see your point , although no one seemed to mind having curry last year , in fact , everyone seemed to enjoy it from what i could tell ... and it 's not so uncommon in &name for performers to pay indirectly for post-concert parties anyway , through their membership fees for eg &name , and some college societies , i think ? 
^ as you say , the problem with providing anything free of charge is money ... but curries are n't really that expensive ... 
^ anyway , do let me know if you still think it 's a really bad idea , or if you have any alternative suggestions ? 
^ see you soon , hope all goes well with the choir tonight &smiley love &name

^ hi guys 
^ thanks for all your efforts . 
^ have just had a useful hour talking through the score with &name who has done the piece many times - very useful ! 
^ i think everything is under control . 
^ all the fun starts tomorrow night ! 
^ &char ith regards to a party , and having spoken to a few musicians , i 'm not convinc &name that everyone would be a ) up for curry or &char ) want to pay for it . 
^ what do you reckon ? 
^ i just feel that i ca n't expect people to give up &num hours of the ir week ( which is what is is for thr choir ) and not do anything . 
^ any thought &char ? 
^ i will happily organise something but the problem ( as we all know ! ) is money . 
^ looking forward to it though ! 
^ cheers

^ the chamber organ has been booked , and will cost &pound; &num all in. &name &char organ people will need to park their van in the car park outside &name 's chapel - apparently they 've always done this before when they 've brou ght the organ to &name 's. 
^ any chance you could sort this ? 
^ the guy 's name &char &char &name &name , and he will be arriving at about 9am . 
^ on this poin &char , do you know what time we can get into the chapel from ? 
^ it would be a huge help if we could get in early on the saturday . 
</text_embedded>

^ great- thanks for sorting that ! 
^ i 'll look into it , if they 've always ha &char this system at &name 's before , it should be a problem ... &name , do you ha ve contact details for the domestic bursar , or do you think this is just something for you and &name to discuss with &name &name when you meet ? 
^ i can certainly be there for 9am- and i expect &name will be there early too 
</text_embedded>

^ ok , i 'll sort this out with &name &name when i e-mail him to arrange meet ing up with him and &name ... that is assuming &name gets back to me soon ... 
^ i expect &name and i will be about all day , and if the chamber organ is coming at 9am , that means we 'll be there at 9am . 
^ as for getting into the chapel we obviously have rehearsals from 10am , but i 'm sure we 'll be able to have access as soon as &name &name is ready on the morning to open the chapel ( i believe he 's not in office until 9am ) .

^ secondly , what 's the situation for post-concert party or the like ? 
^ we ca n't not have one , because as you know , people kind of expect it if they 've given up their time to come and play . 
^ equally , i appreciate &char hat it 's not appropriate to put on a party where everyone drinks way too much like usual . 
^ if you do n't want it to be an " official " thing , then i will put something on for the performers , the only downside being tha &char it 'll cost me a small fortune . . . ...

^ last year we went for a curry- seemed to work well and people appreciat &name having something to go on to- had a good time without lots of alcohol , and there were no complaints that it was n't the usual post-concert party ! 
^ a lso gives time for discussing things arising from the talk- i 'm not sure ho &char much this happened last year , but it certainly did a bit &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'm looking into the possibility of a curry as before - it does have the slight downside that we ca n't pay for the musicians , but there really isn " &char the money about . 
^ however , i think it was reasonably well received last &char ear and enjoyed by those who went . 
^ let me know if you have any objections / have any better ideas . 
^ many thanks and all the best for cums tommorrow , 
^ love &name
