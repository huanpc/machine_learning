^ hi &name - i really enjoyed reading this email . 
^ here are some replies ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ yeah , i thought you would kind of dissapprove of &name . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ actually i really like &name - it was the language i learned to program using . 
^ it is somewhat " toy-town " but that is good if you 're just learning . 
^ it 's certainly a lot easier than c++ ; you 'll soon enough learn the joys of memory pointers and such like ! 
^ &name is great ! 
^ if you ever have any questions , do email me . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ how are you getting on ? 
^ i wonder if &name went to my house tonight as well . 
^ how are you getting on with her ? 
^ i hope things are improving . 
^ still , i do n't really understand why they are the way they are . 
^ my understanding is that she does n't want to see you because it what ? , will make her want to be with you ? 
^ is that right ? 
^ oh , how confusing . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name , if i 'm honest i do n't really fully understand her myself , but yes , that is kind-of it i think . 
^ there is still a lot of " chemistry " between us , but i do n't want to get into a relationship now , and she ca n't really handle seeing me a lot but knowing that we 're not going to get together , although she does n't just want us to get together either , so it 's really not that simple ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ do you ever think that you think about things too much ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yeah , especially when i have n't got lots of other things to do . 
^ it 's fine at the moment because i 'm so busy , but when i 'm not ( such as over the summer ) my mind sometimes plays havoc ! 
^ it 's like a hose pipe that is on all the time , and is fine when the water can be chanelled , but when there is no channel , it can kind-of spray around making a mess . 
^ or something like that ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name said that &name was the same , ie that she thought about things a lot as well . 
^ is that true ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes , she tends to live in a " thoughts world " that &num really ever knows about ( if you see what i mean ) . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i want to get away from the whole term-system and get into the life that so many people are dying to get out of ! 
^ why is that ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ deep questions &name ... deep questions ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ oh , i miss her quite a lot . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i 'm actually quite envious of you that you have a girlfriend like &name . 
^ i often wish that i felt that way about someone . 
^ i hear what you 're saying about the closeness thing though - i guess there 's not a lot you can do about that right now . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i miss you as well , and having a good solid male friend to go and talk to at anytime . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i miss you too . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ do you remember me coming and banging on your door at &num in the morning once ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i think i do remember something about that now that you mention it ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ and on top of the hill that night ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ how could i ever forget that ? ! ? ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ you have been such a good friend to me . 
^ thanks . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &smiley 
^ i had a great time round at your house tonight - the fireworks were truly spectacular , as was the food ! 
^ and i got a new high-score on digger ! ! 
^ on a more serious note , i was chatting to your mum , and mentioned that we were planning to go up to &name in your car with &name . 
^ she said that she was n't too happy about you driving when you might be tired , after having stayed up late in &name , and that she would rather that we got the train . 
^ what do you think ? 
^ speak soon , 
^ &name
