^ call for interest 
^ the &name working group on the representation of &name semantic information , which was established earlier this year and had a small preliminary meeting at &name &num , will hold its first meeting on tuesday , january &num , &num in &name , the &name , in conjunction with the 5th international workshop on computational semantics ( iwcs-5 , january &num ) . 
^ this will be a one-day meeting for discussions on a number of important issues relating to the representation of multimodal semantic information . 
^ working group members and other experts will be asked to prepare position statements on these issues . 
^ we intend to make a website where these position statements will be made available , together with background material that may be useful for preparing the discussions . 
^ the meeting should then primarily consist of structured discussions , fueled by summaries of position statements . 
^ topics to be addressed at the meeting include : 
^ * about the &name in general : 
^ - aims and scope 
^ - objectives and general requirements 
^ + extensibility , openness ,. . 
^ ( see also &name &num workshop paper " towards multimodal remantic representation " by &name &name and &name &name , which can be found at &website 
^ * meaning representation from different perspectives , such as : 
^ - language ( text and speech ) 
^ - language generation 
^ - design of embodied agents 
^ - interpretation of gestures and facial expressions 
^ - fusion and coordination of modalities 
^ - multimodal dialogue system architecture 
^ * what should be represented

^ - information in gestures , postures , facial expressions

^ - social and cultural information 
^ - links to other information 
^ * basic components and mechanisms 
^ - constructs 
^ - mechanisms for linking and sharing 
^ - specific issues , such as + underspecification techniques + flatness of representations 
^ - which representation formalisms should be analysed for best practices , lessons learned , common underlying ideas , special features ,. . 
^ * relation to neighouring activities 
^ - &name , &name , semantic web 
^ - ontologies , domain modeling , user modeling 
^ - lexicon formats 
^ - &name schemes 
^ * action plans 
^ - activities to be undertaken 
^ - who does what when 
^ - &name membership 
^ - &name communication 
^ - next meeting 
^ this &name meeting is open to anyone who takes an active interest in the representation of multimodal semantic information ; the working group also welcomes new members . 
^ if you are interested in participating , and / or in joining the working group , please get in touch with &name &name ( at &email ) who is chairman of this &name and organizes the &name activities together with &name &name ( &name ) and &name &name ( &name ) .
