^ hi , 
^ &website is available ( thanks to &name ) that deals with the buffer size problem by printing out how much space is needed in case of a buffer overrun . 
^ this will keep people from having to guess . 
^ ( &num was the size needed to get all the way through q1 ) . 
^ please copy this new version from 
^ /usr / groups / mphil / xmlrmrs / xmlrmrs. * 
^ and recompile . 
^ &name
