^ the experiments can be run at pretty much any time during normal office hours over the next fortnight and take place in the department of experimental psychology on the &name site . 
^ the only qualifications are that you are over &num and that you have normal or corrected-to-normal vision . 
^ however if you also have normal hearing and normal colour vision and english is your first language then there is a further experiment ( about 1hr , pays &pound; &num ) that you could do on a separate occasion . 
^ if you are still interested let me know when would be convenient for you to come in and i 'll try and arrange it .
