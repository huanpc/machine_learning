^ &name &name ! 
^ thanks for the report on all your doings . 
^ the &num thing sounds very interesting , but then so does &name . 
^ it will be very interesting to see what happens there . 
^ glad to hear you 're still puzzling things through with &name , too . 
^ same here with &name . 
^ we 've been together the better part of a year now so now we 're beginning to ask the tough questions . 
^ some days we seem very compatable , others not . 
^ it 's hard to know when emotions of attachment get in the way . 
^ as you say , giving it to &name and trusting that we 'll somehow stumble onto the right path is all you can do ! 
^ sigh . 
^ / meanwhile , there 's renewed interest in the script . 
^ from an unexpected source . 
^ i 'm meeting with this new " interest " this friday to see what their vision for it is . 
^ i hesitate to say more than that until i know what they 're thinking , though . 
^ it could be great , or simply awful ( or something in between ) . 
^ stay tuned ! 
^ &name bless you , my friend ! 
^ &name 
^ hi &name , 
^ i 've now finished all my lectures , and am just onto the last slog of final exams . 
^ &name ! 
^ still , it will be so nice to finish this undergraduate degree , and find out where my life is going after that . 
^ i think i might have told you that i have applied for a &num digital mapping &name , remaining in &name to do that . 
^ well a couple of weeks ago , it was n't very nice , because i heard that the funding dissappeared due to a huge funds cut in the geological survey . 
^ not good . 
^ so presently i am trying to find a company , probably an oil company , who would like to make me very happy by giving me &pound; &num , &num . 
^ we will see what happens . 
^ i really should be praying about it more than i am . 
^ i now do want to stay in &name more than ever , as things between &name and i are going quite well , and i am keen to pursue this relationship . 
^ i 'm not sure what is going , to happen , in fact , i do n't have a clue , but we will see . 
^ &name knows and i guess i have to trust that he has the best in mind for me , and perhaps he will show me what to do . 
^ i think what is more likely is that i will somehow stumble onto the right path , in a round about way , generally knocking myself around a bit , but i 'll get there in the end ! 
^ i hope things are going well with you . 
^ what is occupying your time now ? 
^ take care , and &name &name , 
^ &name
