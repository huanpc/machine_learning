^ hello my darling child , 
^ today is the last day of term , an in-service day , if i was at work of course , so thoughts are turning to our holiday . 
^ just &num days to go ! 
^ anyway , i 'd like to know that i 'd cleared my debt with you so that i 'm not tempted to feel flush and overspend while i 'm away . 
^ could you send me that number soonest , please ? 
^ how did the meeting go with your advisor ? 
^ is your timetable this year as hectic as ever ?

^ i 'm going to a concert in the &name &name tonight with &name , &name and &name 
^ - &name &name ( rock / blues)- so that should be good if i 'm not deafened like i was after seeing terrorvision there . 
^ &name wants me to join her workmate 's leaving do when we get back to the &name but i 'll think of something to get out of that one , hopefully . 
^ &name passed his driving theory test yesterday but was gutted cuz he only got &num / &num . 
^ i was amazed that he did as well as that cuz he was well wound up and has never seen a computer before ! 
^ at least now he can revert to reading trash newspapers on his way to and from work instead of the theory manual ! 
^ &name continues to be a pain in various parts of my anatomy but &name sez he should be forgived cuz he sends funny emails . 
^ do you communicate with little bro or is it just &name 's persistence that has prevailed ?
