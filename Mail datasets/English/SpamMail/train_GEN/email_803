^ &name my partner in crime , 
^ how 's &name ? 
^ thanks for the card - &name sends her love . 
^ she seems to be rather unstable at the moment . 
^ i have thought a few times , dare i say it , about how nice it would be to 'replace " her . 
^ please keep this quiet as it is a bit of a touchy subject , i 'm sure you can imagine . 
^ ( knowing your experience with women ) 
^ today i was teaching the wee beasties again . 
^ as of this afternoon i decided never to have children ! 
^ &name 
^ i am going to see &name tomorrow , and we will do 'sporty " things like play squash and football . 
^ when are we coming to visit you in the father-land next term ? 
^ did we decide on a date ? 
^ i think we said the first w/end of term ? ? ? 
^ my thumb hurts because my brother kicked a football at me and it bent my hand . 
^ yes , i know it 's a violent game . 
^ how 's the chemistry ? 
^ see ya " 
^ &name 
^ &name , 
^ hi . 
^ the &name code yes , i think it is a hoax probably . 
^ i do n't know an awful lot about it , and i probably think there are significant number patterns in the &name , but i do n't think i like the idea of using word patterns etc. to tell the future . 
^ why do you ask ? 
^ i think you are investigating it . 
^ do you understand the computer-based side ? 
^ i do n't know how much my brother is willing to spend on a guitar - probably a lot if i know him . 
^ what do you mean by " what 's your problem " ? 
^ out of interest , could you tell me your guitar 's model number and details ? 
^ &name seems to think you 're giving it to him . 
^ that 's awfully kind of you &name . 
^ i do n't do caber-tossing . 
^ i do surface chemistry ( at least that 's my aim for today ) . 
^ this afternoon i intend to help my mum paint the bathroom ceiling before going into &name to buy some mother 's day gifts . 
^ i do hope &name gets better soon . 
^ have you got &name &name &name yet ? 
^ incidentally , your storage heater was on , but i 've switched it off now . 
^ &name this is a short e-mail , surface chemistry is calling - faintly . 
^ " till you reply , 
^ &name
