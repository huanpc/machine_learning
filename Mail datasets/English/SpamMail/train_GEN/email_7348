^ dear all , now that i know what i 'm doing next year , i can let you all know more details ! 
^ for those that i have n't already told , i 'm going to &name as a language assistant in &num secondary schools . 
^ the contract is &num hours per week , so lots of free time- a lot of people do some studying , or get another job- i have n't decided yet . 
^ if i find a good church it 'll be a chance to get really involved in that if they 'd find it useful . 
^ i do n't think i 'll know exactly what my responsibilities will be until i get there , or at least till the schools get in touch with me . 
^ the assistants that we had at my school just tended to take groups of &num pupils out for oral practice , and helped 6th-formers with a-level prep , but some of the 4th years at uni who i 've spoken to had far more responsibility by the end , they had entire classes to themselves . 
^ i think it depends what you want- the opportunities are there to be taken ! 
^ assuming it all goes fine , i 'm intending to get quite involved in the schools , it 'll be a really good chance to see properly whether teaching as a career really would suit me . 
^ i 'll be renting a flat there probably , hopefully not with lots of english people ! 
^ would be quite fun if it was with other foreign language assistants though ! 
^ i guess i 'll go over in summer to look for something- that 's what a lot of people seem to do . 
^ i 've already got &num potential christian contacts there , and a lady that i randomly sat next to in church &num sunday last term gave me the address of the austrian &name &name , that i did n't even know existed . 
^ so that 's good . 
^ i 'm assuming that in a city the size of &name there 'll be at least &num good church- i 've never been to &name so i do n't know it at all , so pray that i find somewhere good ! 
^ &name ( world-wide uni christian union movement ) also have a team in &name most years , i wo n't go on it as a full member &name it does n't really mix too well with trying to do another job , but i might well get in touch with them and see if i can help out . 
^ i do n't know what the schools are like that i 've been given- when i write to them , hopefully they 'll get back to me and let me know lots about them ! 
^ the contract is october-may , so i 'll have a huge summer afterwards ! 
^ will probably try and get to &name and do some work there , so as not to forget all my spanish ! 
^ well i think that 's all for now , do pray for me- i 'm not scared at present but i 'm sure i will be when the time draws nearer ! 
^ pray for wisdom to know how to use my time , and that i really give the year to &name , rather than just doing what i feel like . 
^ lots of love , &name 
^ 'most assuredly , i say to you , he who hears my word and believes in him who sent &name has everlasting life , and shall not come into judgement , but has passed from death into life . " &name 5v24- the &name
