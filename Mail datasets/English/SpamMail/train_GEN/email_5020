^ hello everyone ,

^ 
^ - causatives ( and alikes ) : the &name always uses a separate message as &name of predicatives , e.g. ( &char need it on my desk " ) 
^ h0 : _need_prd_rel ( ... , &name h1 ) h1 : prpstn_rel ( &name h2 ) h3 : _on_rel ( ... ) h2 &name h3 
^ we suspected there is a good reason for this ( and that it relates to the larg-ish number of scoping results ) , but what exactly will be wrong about omitting the message and using h3 as &name of need ?

^ my understanding of this one is that every clause needs a message , so if there are &num clauses , there are &num messages . 
^ &name , we ( &name & &char ) could n't imagine what a scope ambiguity between a quantifier and a message could mean . 
^ so , since the value of the &name is directly the handle of the message rel , there 's no additional scopings . 
^ &name , &name
