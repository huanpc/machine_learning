^ that 's rough man ... but i guess your team 's lack of depth ( besides at &num , &char , and maybe ss ) is being exposed now that &name 's out with the injury . 
^ maybe now you know how i felt the past &num years when my of was the bane of my existence . 
^ &char frustrating game , this &smiley 
^ i still do n't understand why you 'd bench &name .. i would play him as much as i can until he goes down with his yearly season ending injury . 
^ to help you with remembering my other address : da ( my initials ) , &num ( my favorite number backwards ) , &num ( the number of fantasy standing positions you are behind me ) , @ ( every email address needs one of these ) , &name ( i go to &name ) , .ac ( &name is an academic institution - ac is the correlate of edu in &name ) , .uk ( &name is locatied in the &name ) . 
^ so that 's &email - which is the short version . 
^ that 's equivialent to &email and also &email . 
^ they all go to the same place . 
^ &name 
^ on &name , &num may &num &email wrote :

^ again not remembering your herpes address ... 
^ &name ( including bench ) went &num for &num with &num run scored and &num &name yesterday . 
^ &num walks , both on the bench . 
^ meanwhile &name pitches &num run ball for &num innings but the &char 's ca n't beat the tigers , &name pitches &num run ball for &num innings but &name shuts down the &name ( which is why &name was on the bench ) , but the impotent &name offense scores enough off of &name for &name to get the win ... on my bench . 
^ &name and &name with good &char / ip , &name not so much . 
^ this game kills me . 
^ it 's a good thing &name got a save or i might really be pissed .
