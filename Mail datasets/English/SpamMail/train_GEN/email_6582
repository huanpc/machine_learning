^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : &name &name &name could enable &name &name ( q328145 ) released : september &num , &num &name : september &num , &num ( version &num ) &name : &name &name , &name office for &name , &name &name explorer for &name , or &name &name &name for &name . 
^ &name : identity spoofing . 
^ &name &name : critical 
^ &name : ms02-050 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ reason for &name : &name normally , &name releases the patches for all affected products simultaneously , in order to provide a complete solution . 
^ however , exploit code for this issue has already been posted , and we are therefore releasing the patches as they become available , in order to allow customers to begin protecting their systems as quickly as possible . 
^ the bulletin has been updated to include patch availability for windows &num . 
^ patches are now available for : 
^ - &name &num 
^ - &name &num second edition 
^ - &name me 
^ - &name &name &num 
^ - &name &name &num , terminal &name &name 
^ - &name &num 
^ - &name &name 
^ - &name &name &num bit edition 
^ patches will be available shortly for : 
^ - &name office &name for &name 
^ - &name office &num for &name 
^ - &name office &num for the &name 
^ - &name &name explorer for &name ( for &name &num to 9.x ) 
^ - &name &name explorer for &name ( for &name &char ) 
^ - &name &name &name &num for &name 
^ customers should also review the caveats section of the bulletin which discusses a warning message that may be displayed after installing the patch . 
^ updated patches are under development to eliminate this side effect . 
^ &name : &name &website certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate . 
^ one of these is the basic constraints field , which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate 's chain and whether the certificate is a certificate authority or an end-entity certificate . 
^ however , the &name within &name that construct and validate certificate chains ( &name ( ) , &name ( ) , and &name ( ) ) do not check the basic constraints field . 
^ the same flaw , unrelated to &name , is also present in several &name products for &name . 
^ the vulnerability could enable an attacker who had a valid end-entity certificate to issue a subordinate certificate that , although bogus , would nevertheless pass validation . 
^ because &name is used by a wide range of applications , this could enable a variety of identity spoofing attacks . 
^ these are discussed in detail in the bulletin &name , but could include : 
^ - setting up a web site that poses as a different web site , and " proving " its identity by establishing an &name session as the legitimate web site . 
^ - sending emails signed using a digital certificate that purportedly belongs to a different user . 
^ - &name certificate-based authentication systems to gain entry as a highly privileged user . 
^ - digitally signing malware using an authenticode certificate that claims to have been issued to a company users might trust . 
^ mitigating factors : &name overall : 
^ - the user could always manually check a certificate chain , and might notice in the case of a spoofed chain that there was an unfamiliar intermediate ca . 
^ - unless the attacker 's digital certificate were issued by &char ca in the user 's trust list , the certificate would generate a warning when validated . 
^ - the attacker could only spoof certificates of the same type as the one he or she possessed . 
^ in the case where the attacker attempted an attack using a high-value certificate such as authenticode certificates , this would necessitate obtaining a legitimate certificate of the same type - which could require the attacker to prove his or her identity or entitlement to the issuing ca . 
^ web &name &name : 
^ - the vulnerability provides no way for the attacker to cause the user to visit the attacker 's web site . 
^ the attacker would need to redirect the user to a site under the attacker 's control using a method such as &name poisoning . 
^ as discussed in the bulletin &name , this is extremely difficult to carry out in practice . 
^ - the vulnerability could not be used to extract information from the user 's computer . 
^ the vulnerability could only be used by an attacker as a means of convincing a user that he or she has reached a trusted site , in the hope of persuading the user to voluntarily provide sensitive data . 
^ email signing : 
^ - the " from " address on the spoofed mail would need to match the one specified in the certificate , giving rise to either of &num scenarios if a recipient replied to the mail . 
^ in the case where the " from " and 'reply-to " fields matched , replies would be sent to victim of the attack rather than the attacker . 
^ in the case where the fields did n't match , replies would obviously be addressed to someone other than ostensible sender . 
^ either case could be a tip-off that an attack was underway . 
^ certificate-based authentication : 
^ - in most cases where certificates are used for user authentication , additional information contained within the certificate is necessary to complete the authentication . 
^ the type and format of such data typically varies with every installation , and as a result significant insider information would likely be required for a successful attack . 
^ &name &name : 
^ - to the best of &name 's knowledge , such an attack could not be carried out using any commercial ca 's authenticode certificates . 
^ these certificates contain policy information that causes the basic constraints field to be correctly evaluated , and none allow end-entity certificates to act as &name . 
^ - even if an attack were successfully carried out using an authenticode certificate that had been issued by a corporate &name , it would n't be possible to avoid warning messages , as trust in authenticode is brokered on a per-certificate , not per-name , basis .
