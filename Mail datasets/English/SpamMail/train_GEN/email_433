^ my dearest &name , 
^ " i could not change , &name loves me the way i am . 
^ i do n't know , do you think i have moral standards or not ? " 
^ - do i have your permission to be " holy " ? 
^ &name loves us . 
^ he does n't like us the way we are , that 's why he wants to change us to be like &name . 
^ i 'm sure you do have moral standards . 
^ not as strong as &name 's, well , perhaps just different . 
^ &name has the effect on me of inducing me to relax my moral standards . 
^ there is something about people with higher moral standards than your own which can be slightly suffocating . 
^ i have not discussed morals at length with you , so i ca n't say very much , except that you come across as being more concerned with being able to get alongside people in order for them to notice that you 're a christian and talk about it in their own time , rather than being more separate from them . 
^ this is good . 
^ it is also good not to compromise your principles - that is what &name does . 
^ i am not saying you do , and i am not judging you - please remember this ! 
^ out of curiosity , and as a topic for conversation , what do you think about my moral principles ? 
^ 'daisy looks forward to the ever-closening day when she gets to know our pet a little better . " 
^ - soon to be . 
^ " no , things are not moving quickly with &name . 
^ they are not moving anywhere at all . " 
^ - have i struck a nerve ? 
^ &name , just joking . 
^ " i would not make myself an object of ridicule just for your amusement . " 
^ - &name i 'm disappointed . 
^ &name did . 
^ " why ca n't i tell &name you went shopping ? 
^ does n't he like you helping old people ? " it was on a sunday , &name i like being patronising to people ! 
^ the story about &name and &name was absolutely hilarious . 
^ you made me laugh a lot . 
^ thank you , you are very funny . 
^ " i have had my hair cut , but it does n't look great , never mind . 
^ i 'll just tie it up . " 
^ - if it 's not as bad as &name 's then it 's fine . 
^ " i have n't done a lot of work yet but i have been out for another run ! " 
^ - do n't worry , you sound as if you 've done more work than &name , and running is good . 
^ have you started your diet again yet ? 
^ " when are we going to connect via the internet , of course ? " 
^ - oh , good ! 
^ well , what about friday evening at &name ? 
^ are you free then ? 
^ can you use &name instant messenger , then we do n't have to bother about chat-rooms ? 
^ it only takes &num minutes or so to download , and it 's wonderful . 
^ if you want the web-address , then ask me for it . 
^ now , what do you think about the following adverts for the &name thing ? 
^ for &name 
^ &name , &name cmt-cpt . 
^ cd-player , hifi , radio , cassette , mini-disk capability . 
^ &name new , barely used , speakers included only &pound; &num 
^ for &name 
^ &name &name guitar . 
^ good condition . 
^ bargain . 
^ &pound; &num 
^ well ? 
^ i should think &name 's guitar is definitely a " bargain " , considering he bought it for &pound; &num in a sale ! 
^ this will be most amusing ! 
^ i 'm going down to &name tomorrow , and will post the adverts then . 
^ i may telephone you from the flat sometime . 
^ is there anything you want done ? 
^ i 'd better do some of my lab-report now . 
^ so long my love 
^ &name 
^ &name april 1st is fast approaching - we need ideas ! 
^ &name i 've just received this news from &name yesterday : " as of this afternoon i decided never to have children ! " very interesting . 
^ &name this is just in from &name too : " i am going to see &name tomorrow , and we will do 'sporty " things . " curiouser and curiouser . 
^ &name &name has made a startling revelation to me . 
^ it is big news , but he wants me to keep it under my hat for the moment . 
^ i am actively seeking clearance , as it could be quite amusing to publish to the world . 
^ ( do n't worry , it 's just ridiculous news , regarding &name . ) i shall keep you updated . 
^ adieu .
