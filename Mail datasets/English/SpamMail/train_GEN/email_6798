^ hi &name &name you 're well . 
^ thanks for the updated version of your talk . 
^ the program editor has suggested to me that the best way to introduce you to the audience would be to put a short piece and a small photo ( ! ) of you in the program , in the same way that there is a short piece about each soloist and the conductor . 
^ if you agree that this would be suitable , would you be able to send me a short piece ( read the program for the format of the pieces on the soloists ) and a small photo , if you have a suitable electronic photo , or could send a suitable &num 1st class in the post . 
^ thanks very much for your help , &name
