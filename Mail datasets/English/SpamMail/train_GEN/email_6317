^ on &name &num &num , &name &name wrote : hi sorry i have n't replied sooner but i do n't have access to e-mail at home . 
^ thanks for your e-mail ; it was good to try and see what &name wanted . 
^ &name and i had decided not to continue going out at that stage , because we both felt that we had issues we needed to sort out , and &name felt that it would be better to sort those out outside of a relationship . 
^ thank you for your prayers and advice , and i hope that our friendship will continue to be strong . 
^ i 'll keep this brief , but hopefully we 'll be able to talk on tuesday . 
^ see you at the houseparty may you know always the peace of &name &name

^ hi ! 
^ how are things with you ? 
^ things any better / different with you & &name ? 
^ hope you had a good day together sailing the other week & you 're able to keep trusting &name . 
^ hope you found something useful within my last e-mail 
^ - i now have passion & &name ( bought it in &name last week ) if you want to borrow it ( not sure if it 'll be any use , but if you feel inclined to read it , i 'll quite happily lend it to you ) . 
^ had a great time in &name last week , seeing family & friends whom we 've not seen for some time . 
^ unlike past occassions where it 's been strained staying with &num particular set of relatives ( in particular because &num cousin there is autistic and the other sharing almost nothing in common with any of others ) , due to the short time we were able to stay and because we 're all older it was a really pleasant time . 
^ and it was good to be able to walk on &name again , which i have n't done for quite some time ! 
^ could i ask you to pray for something myself ? 
^ as you know , we 've started on preparation work for the next &name concert , hopefully &name 's passion in &name 's chapel . 
^ however , despite letters and various e-mails to the person whom we wanted to conduct it ( &name &name ) , we 've not had any response . 
^ therefore it looks like we 're going to have to ask someone else . 
^ this is hard because we need someone who is at least sympathetic to &name 's aims and preferably in line with them , but we also need someone who is very talented musically and highly respected . 
^ so your prayers for wisdom for &name & myself would be very much appreciated . 
^ &name and peace of our &name &name &name be with you , 
^ &name
