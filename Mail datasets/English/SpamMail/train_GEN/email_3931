^ hey &name yeah have n't talked for ages . 
^ i 've got my weeekend off at the moment , which is nice , having worked straight through from the end of august with no consectutive days off until yesterday . 
^ i guess that 's normal , but it has been pretty intense . 
^ the best thing that has happened is that &num kids from the youth group have become christians and we have started a disciple ship course with them . 
^ it has also been great getting to know the staff at the school . 
^ they are really friendly , and have been really encouraging . 
^ it has been challenging teaching &name lessons , but &name has been very good . 
^ i have got some of the hardest classes in the school , but they seem to respond well to having me ( thye are all girls classes and are enjoying doing footie ) also we are totally accepted in the community , and i feel like i am becoming poart of the church . 
^ on the more difficult side , i have also been very lonely . 
^ i get on well with the boys , but i do n't find i chat to them that much . 
^ also because we work together i do n't particularly want to spend my days off with them too ! ! 
^ but we have plans to get to know others in the church and &name the youth worker and i get on brilliantly . 
^ it is hard not having people to mess around with and go for long walks on &name afternoons with ! ! ! ! 
^ i 'm not coming to &name 's party its impossible , sorry , bbut new year sounds great . 
^ glad that things are looking up for you and that you are making friends and doing &name stuff . 
^ i;ll keep praying . 
^ love &name

^ hi &name , 
^ i have n't talked to or e-mail you for ages , and i feel like i have neglected you somewhat . 
^ i am sorry . 
^ i am feeling a whole lot more settled here at the moment , which is good , cause when i got here , i really was n't too happy a &name . 
^ i missed you guys and &name so much , that i got quite lonely , and almost did n't want to make any more friends , because they could n't be as good as my &name &num ! 
^ thankfully i got over that , and am now starting to make friends , and though they are by no means equivalent to you guys , and i really do n't do anything with anyone in the evenings , i dislike it here a whole lot less . 
^ the time seems to fly by . 
^ i was up in &name last weekend , and it was great ! 
^ i went back to claypath , and it was also &name 's 21st birthday , which was great . 
^ it was also &name 's birthday , and my grandad 's 75th ( which we celebrated in &name ) . 
^ &name came to my grandad 's party , which i think she was quite terrified about , but 'did " very well , as i think my relatives liked her . 
^ i can hardly imagine anyone not likeing her though ...

^ i am currently trying to organise a christmas event herre for the cu at silsoe , and am thinking &char seriously about getting the local church involved as well , as it would be great to reach out to more than just the &num people on campus here .
