^ &name ! 
^ and this is you when you 're supposedly not busy ! ! ! ! ! 
^ you are mad . 
^ but i know how stuff piles up . 
^ do n't know where it comes from but there 's always something to do . . ... i am very worried , panicky about my exams in less than &num weeks and revision going soooo slowly . ... aargh . 
^ the maths is just soooo hard . 
^ hope you have fun singing / listening ( was the soul singing or listening ? ) in &name . 
^ and you 're going to &name this summer ! 
^ how exciting . 
^ i 've never been to &name &name . 
^ is this your first trip there ? 
^ you 'll come back speaking portugese . 
^ that 'd be cool , would n't it ? 
^ is there a rambler 's walk on sat , then ? 
^ i 'm on the list but i 've never been on anything . 
^ do you know &name &name ( &name &name ) ? 
^ she 's quite involved in the ramblers . . ... maybe i should go on one of the walks one of these fine summer days . ... no , no , must not do anymore unnecessary things ! ! ! 
^ must work . 
^ must work . 
^ must &name * still not convinced! * great that your int-rep is gonna join us . 
^ look forward to seeing her . 
^ and i 'll see you in a week then . 
^ or something . 
^ yup , the " &name and his friends " is soooo good . 
^ but now i 've twice as much to think about in my prep ! ! ! 
^ &name 's word is so amazing . 
^ you can never get to the bottom of it . 
^ it 's hard to know how much time to give to what in the &name &name everything is just so great ! ! 
^ so , let me know if anyone else decides to come to the conference , &name ? 
^ oh , and you can see i do n't read the &name bulletins terribly carefully as i did n't notice it ! ! 
^ ( though to be fair , i 'd just got the stuff out of my pidge , wed afternoon so it was more of a skim-read to pick up interesting prayer points . ) and there are so many bits that come to my pidge ! 
^ could n't possibly read all of them carefully ! ! 
^ nyways , have a great fun , busy , god-focused , praiseful , joyful week . 
^ ( enough adjectives ? ) 
^ love in &name , &name
