^ &name , 
^ thank you kindly for emailing me with all those fascinating questions . 
^ i will endeavour to answer them now : 
^ &num &num so , how is your first week back in &name going ? 
^ my first week back in &name was not spent in &name , if you see what i mean . 
^ nor was it spent in the bath , if that 's what you meant . 
^ i was away in &name at a christian schools convention , where i judged junior platform events and played the bass guitar with my dad in the evening meetings . 
^ ( we did not play the same guitar , in case that 's what you were thinking . ) 
^ &num &num are you enjoying your job ? 
^ i have not started my job yet . 
^ that begins on monday . 
^ i spoke to my boss today who has decided to take my first week off in &name . 
^ i told him i thought that was a bit of a desperate measure - he disagreed . 
^ &num &num why have n't you emailed me yet ? 
^ i site the answer to question &num as a possible answer to the above question . 
^ &num &num what time is it ? 
^ the time is &num : &num according to my computer clock . 
^ &num &num do you like being asked questions ? 
^ &name , &name i suppose so . 
^ &num &num could you think of as many questions as me ? 
^ almost certainly - for example : how many sheep are there in your house ? 
^ how many sheep are there in your garden ? 
^ how many sheep are there in your village ? 
^ how many sheep are there in your county ? 
^ how many sheep are there in &name ? 
^ i do not expect answers to these questions . 
^ i 'm glad to hear you are learning to cook . 
^ i also cooked dinner last night , and very nice it was too . 
^ you 'll be pleased to learn that i have a 'really useful student cook-book " ! 
^ well , tonight i am going with my family round to a friend 's house for some kind of take-away . 
^ it will probably not involve ravens , but i 'm sure it will be nice anyway . 
^ see you later &name , 
^ &name
