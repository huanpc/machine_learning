^ &name &name ! 
^ i guess while i 'm writing this you 'll be braving the horrible traffic in &name . 
^ &name &name was fantastic - tough work , but i think &name taught me a lot ! 
^ i guess it 's a bit late now to meet before thursday , so i would love to meet after tuesday next week - tuesday itself is actually quite good for me although if not , thursday would be great too . 
^ should be free pretty much all of tuesday ( apart from 6-7pm ) and thursday ( apart from &num and &num onwards ) - so tell me when would be a good time . 
^ see you soon and thanks for offering to meet up with me , 
^ &name
