^ my father 's given me cash , sufficient i think . 
^ according to the timetable my mother gave me there is on bus [ &num ] 1410-)1635 ( 2hr25 ) then another [ &num ] 1510-)1755e ( 2hr45 ) - these are the &num you mean ( i assume ) . 
^ so there 's only 20min between the &num travel times , although of course the &num o' clock &num is an hour later anyway .
