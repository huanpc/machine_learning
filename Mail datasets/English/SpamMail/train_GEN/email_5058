^ hi &name , 
^ that bi-dialog paper that you and &name stuck my name on - is it going to appear in a book soon ? 
^ i was &name on lots of messages but do n't remember seeing the publication schedule . 
^ ( our dept is engaged on yet another publication counting exercise , that 's why i 'm asking . ) i guess at some point having the publication details ( book title etc ) would be useful anyway , so if you 've got that handy somewhere , could you forward it to me ? 
^ &name all is well , 
^ all best , 
^ &name
