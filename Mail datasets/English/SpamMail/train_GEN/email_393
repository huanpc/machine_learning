^ there must be &num member of the male species who is . 
^ airplane is a good film there are more in that genre . 
^ we will rent them next term . 
^ my family liked the idea of my x/mas presents , and my dad found the whole tim-giving-us-photos-hed-taken-himslef thing quite amusing . 
^ my dada can relate to that . 
^ bored , watching lots of trashy tv . 
^ what you up to ?

^ dear &name , 
^ thank you so much for your little note . 
^ it was really nice . 
^ &name , i am not so intuitive as you may have assumed ! 
^ &name told me you liked that kind of thing . 
^ however , i am glad i asked her advice , as i have now found a shop in &name that i really like - unfortunately they do n't take switch . 
^ at least i think i like it , and i shall be going back there later this afternoon to search for christmas presents to give to my family . 
^ i do n't understand why you apologised for saying " thanks for being so sweet " ! 
^ i do n't mind . 
^ i will e-mail you a lot , and i hope you do too . 
^ however , when i look over some of the e-mails i sent you last summer i can scarcely believe i actually sent them ! 
^ anyway , this is not a very amusing e-mail . 
^ &name shall surely follow . 
^ also , i have an idea for an interesting piece of photo-art which i may well conjure up over the holidays . 
^ ( it does not - unless you want it to - contain your picture , but it may well be quite amusing for anyone who knows &name . ) 
^ well , i hope you 're enjoying being at home and do n't miss &name too much . 
^ i know i probably will . 
^ see you next term . 
^ &name 
^ &name i have just watched " airplane " ! 
^ it 's absolutely ridiculous ! ! ! 
^ yes , some of it was extremely amusing , hilarious infact . 
^ other parts were not as interesting . 
^ however , thanks awfully for leaving it for me to watch. ( ! )
