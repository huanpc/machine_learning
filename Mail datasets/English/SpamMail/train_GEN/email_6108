^ hello all ! 
^ i hope you enjoyed a good summer break . 
^ thanks for your help in chapel last year and before - if you would be able to clerk again this year , that would be superb ! 
^ there seemed to be lots of enthusiastic freshers at the first service last sunday evening , many of them signed down to say they would read in chapel - with luck we will be able to recruit a few more clerks ! 
^ if you can persuade anyone ( 1st years or others ) to clerk , then point them in my direction . 
^ i have put a blank chapel clerking rota for this term in the chapel vestry . 
^ i thought it might be a good idea to let people have some choice over which services they clerk , to try to avoid some of the clashes which occurred last term . 
^ if you would like to do this , then just call in to the vestry over the next day or so and sign down for about &num of each type of service . 
^ we might have to make a couple of adjustments towards the latter end of term to accommodate any new clerks though ! 
^ what better time to meet up for a chapel clerks " formal hall than the beginning of a new term and year ? ! 
^ if you can come along to formal hall after evensong on sunday then sign up at the &name machine . 
^ i hope to see you there . 
^ best wishes ,
