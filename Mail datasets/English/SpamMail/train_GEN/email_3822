<text_normal> 

^ &name to hear from you . 
^ we did have a " &name " time at your place and thoroughly enjoyed &name . 
^ it is a great city with incredible history ( the punting tour helped ! ) . 
^ please tell your parents again how much we appreciated their kindness . 
^ just prior to the visit we had spent &num weeks building a playroom loft in the attic space above the bedrooms . 
^ needless to say we all needed a break and it was fun just to hang out with the kids . 
^ i must say that i also had a great time seeing all the sports ( especially hockey ) paraphernalia / memorabilia . 
^ it is not hard to believe that &num active boys / men have grown up in that home . 
^ also great to hear that you had such a great time in &name / &name . 
^ we do continue pray that you will find the right opportunity at the right time with the right kind of funding - that is a walk of faith which we are currently on as well ! 
^ once again , thanks &name for your family 's hospitality . 
^ we look forward to seeing &name when term begins , and also having you in our home when you come to visit . 
^ just let us know ! 
^ with every good wish , 
^ &name 
^ hi &name !

^ i 'm so glad that you guys could come and use our house , and we were very blessed by your thank you letter ! 
^ it was great to hear that you had had a good time , even things like having your own bathroom ! 
^ i 'm so glad you could come ! 
^ and thank you so much , &name , for the amazing lasagne that you left us ! 
^ it was such a wonderful gesture , and so very welcome , as it meant that &name did n't have to cook for us that night , and so she could just rest . 
^ ( she was so grateful , and we all loved it ! ) thank you very much ! 
^ i suppose things are starting to start up again in &name , and i so wish that i could be back there . 
^ i still have n't got stuff sorted for next year , but everyone keeps telling me that &name will provide the right thing at the right time . 
^ i hope tomorrow is the right time . 
^ my brother &name and i had a good time in &name &name , travelling northwards from &name &name to &name &name , through &name &name , &name and &name to some friends cottage for a wedding , then to our old town . 
^ then we travelled south to &name and back to &name &name . 
^ &num weeks and &num miles driving ! 
^ it 's nice to be back home now ! 
^ &name has just been to stay , which has been great . 
^ she has now gone home , and so the search for masters / &name / job etc re-begins . 
^ say hi to all the family from me , 
^ &name
