^ &name , 
^ go ahead and email &name - no problems . 
^ we have talked lots about it , and it does hurt , but we 're both pretty open about that . 
^ what do i think about &name - not sure because i 've only ever seen her in a very limited capacity . 
^ i think you need to see how people act in a number of different and challenging situations before you even begin to get to know who they really are . 
^ she seems nice , but &num thing you can be sure of is that when you get to know her , you will find that she is different than you think now ! 
^ that is the beauty / challenge of relationships ! 
^ speak soon , 
^ &name

^ &name ! ! ! 
^ &name , 
^ my favourite canadian / american / &name . 
^ ( of course ! ) 
^ i am missing you ! 
^ thanks &name , the feeling is mutual . 
^ sometimes i really wish i could just bang my way into your room , and talk . 
^ oh well , i guess i 'll have to wait untill next 
^ te rm . 
^ my trips down to &name will be common me thinks . 
^ does this remind you of the first year ? 
^ ( wow that seems a long time ago ... ) 
^ today is the last day before the end of term . 
^ it has gone very quickly , as always . 
^ tonight &name and &name &name are coming over for a meal and then i am playing in the leavers formal . 
^ how did it go ? 
^ ok , let me tell you about myself and &name . 
^ fasten your seatbelts , here it comes . ... 
^ you remember that i said i was going to talk to you , but then there was n't time so i said i 'd email you . 
^ i was just waiting for a good time , and here it is ! ... 
^ i was wondering if you had forgotten . 
^ first of all , can you remember me telling you at the start that we did n't really know what to do in our relationship , because we did n't feel it was right to just follow society , and at the same time we did n't know what commitment to make , etc. etc. 
^ i remember you saying that , but was it a mutual decision , or one of yours which &name accepted ? 
^ well , we never actually made a real decision about what our commitment was to each other - i never " asked her out " or anything . 
^ however we obviously had a strong mutual atraction and we were n't sure what to do with it . 
^ in the end , people assumed we were " going out " and after a while we just told people that anyway because that was what they understood . 
^ in fact , we started to take on that " couple " sort of image because of different people 's expectations as well as our own . 
^ now , we 'd both been feeling uncomfortable for a while , but we did n't know why . 
^ really ? 
^ i did n't know that . 
^ at this point i 'm going to have to give you a bit of an abbreviated version of my inner ramblings , because otherwise it would take too long . 
^ and we both know just how long those words of wisdom can sometimes take to reach the ears of your listeners , do n't we ? 
^ can you remember when we were walking to college , and we were talking about what to do in your relationship before you are ready to make the marriage commitment ? 
^ we were saying that it is best to stay away from an exclusive marriage-type relationship so that you can hear &name properly before you actually decide to get married . 
^ well , after a number of different conversations ( with my mum , brother , friend from home , you , etc. etc. ) i realised why i was feeling uncomfortable about my relationship with &name . 
^ i realised that for us it was wrong to have an exclusive couple-type relationship when neither of us was ready to get married . 
^ &name , but i did n't think you were very exclusive , and it certainly was n't marrage like , in the physical sence , and you did n't spend huge amounts of time togeather . 
^ i thought you had changed your views on relationships to some degree . 
^ this is a very much shortened version of what led me to this decision , but for the rest you 'll have to speak to me because it would take too long to write . 
^ we 'll certainly do this next year . 
^ i 'll need some excuse to come and see you . 
^ so , i spoke to &name and she knew that it was the right thing as well , and we decided that we should not have a commitment to each other before we were ready to at least plan for marriage . 
^ i spoke to her just around the time you left . 
^ it is not an easy thing for us , and we are still working a lot of things out , but i feel it is for the best , even though it is all quite confusing to me in a lot of ways . 
^ this might throw up quite a few questions for you , i realise . 
^ feel free to email me and ask me anything you want to . 
^ &name , thanks for explaining that , &name . 
^ i know you thinki about things loads , and probably too much , but maybe not . 
^ so i assume you have n't rushed into this . 
^ i 'm sorry you are confused . 
^ i 'm having trouble remembering what i was like when &name and i broke up . 
^ was &num confused ? 
^ i think i probably was relieved ... 
^ how 's &name doing ? 
^ i 'm just assuming most of the leading on this disicion came from you , and even if she agreed i 'm concerned that she 's hurt . 
^ would you mind if i e-mailed her about this ? 
^ feel free to say no , if you think that that would be better . 
^ i wo n't be offended in the least . 
^ now some news from my side . ... 
^ i 've been e-mialing &name very frequently , which has been really good . 
^ when i left , i was concerned that the relationship was getting out of control , ie that i was seeing her lots , and we were going out , even if we wer n't " offically " . 
^ anyway , i suppose when a relationship is based on e-mail it kinda puts a distancce between you , which makes it more .. safe ( ? ) . 
^ still , now that there is this distance , i want to see her more . 
^ weird eh ? 
^ i 'm sure we 've talked about this before . 
^ the whole wanting what you ca n't have thing . 
^ what do you think about &name ? 
^ &name , thanks again for your e-mail , 
^ love from &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ get your free&email address at &website or your free&email address at &website
