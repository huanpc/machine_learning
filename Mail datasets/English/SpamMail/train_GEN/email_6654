^ dear &name , 
^ looking forward to our trip to &name next weekend ; what are your plans ? 
^ shall we see you at the confirmation ? 
^ ( &name i 'm not sure where now , was &name &name but i think its now their church - &name &name &name , is n't it ? ) otherwise / anyway see you on saturday ? 
^ when are you free - to take delivery of bike , coat , tools ( subject to me finding those &num ) and lamp 
^ - anything else ? 
^ - and possibly for lunch ? 
^ &name nothing vital got blown away at the weekend . 
^ no problems here though a tree down on river &name meant that dad had to drive through the garden centre to collect &name from work on sunday ! 
^ &name &name , who had come home to celebrate &num year of going out with &name , had returned saturday night , as sunday trains were cancelled . 
^ &name has now got a room down there , at the top of the same tower &name is in ; i 'm sure that tower would have moved quite spectacularly in the wind , but she was away that weekend too ! 
^ &name and &name staying with &name and grandad at the moment . 
^ the car stopped working yesterday - all fixed now and luckily nothing major . 
^ love , mum & dad
