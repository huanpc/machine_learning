^ just a note 
^ a collection of classes containing syntax errors was committed to the repository last night , causing automated builds to break . 
^ please could all obviously broken code be commented out ( and marked with a bloody great big fluorescent comment ! ) before committing classes to the repository . 
^ if in doubt , it is probably okay to commit code with logical errors ( as long as work is obviously in progress ) , but not okay to commit code with syntax errors . 
^ the particular broken code is question has been commented out and recommitted to the repository . 
^ please do an update before making further changes . 
^ any further offences will be punished with the use of a big stick ! 
^ all the best
