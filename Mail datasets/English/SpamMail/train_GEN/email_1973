" - he cannot think of anything humorous to say tonight so you have been left with aunt  ame 's efforts . ^ after sunday we will not have access to the internet , so if you reply  ame will send a copy to the rest of us from  ame . ^ however ,  ame will be pleased to have correspondence from you also . ^ okay , this is it for now . ^ meantime , look after yourself , enjoy yourself and be good . ^ your loving aunt , uncle and cousins -  ame ,  ame ,  ame &  ame . </text_normal></message_body></message>
