^ hi &name , &name and &name i 'm slightly confused about the issue of follow-up / literature for the concert . 
^ there is now an advert for the witness cafe , for the &name this term and for the &name service on the back page of the program , however it would be good to eitehr flag this up somehow and to have some kind of literature available . 
^ i suggest that you liaise with &name ( this e-mail it to him as well ) re . 
^ the &name 's gospels and see what you can organise . 
^ let me know how it comes along , love &name

^ sorry for all the e-mails today guys ... things are warming up now and so no doubt there 'll be more to come ! 
^ &name just posed a question which i do n't know if you 've thought about at all , or if you 'd like me to think about : 
<text_embedded> 

^ somehow we need to work out how we 're going to follow up . 
^ do we get &name to plug witness cafe for students ? 
^ offer copies of &name 's gospel and &name ?

^ these were our thoughts- i think we 'd decided to put something about the witness cafe on the back page of the programme , and we 've been looking into using any left-over gospels from witness ... what we do with them will depend on how many there are . 
^ what are your thoughts on how we could finance this ? 
^ there 's not really any more room in the budget ( &name , correct me if i 'm wrong!)- or would this just come out of the normal &name literature costs ? ? ? 
^ thanks , &name

^ let me know your thoughts ...
