^ natural language and information processing group seminar &website / 
^ &name : language models for information retrieval speaker : &name &name 
^ &name , &name , tuesday 29th october 
^ &org , &name &name building , &name &name avenue &website 
^ &name : &num of the most difficult problems in information retrieval ( &name ) is to define a good similarity measure between queries and a documents . 
^ the goodness of this measure will depend on several factors , such as its precision and recall , its computational cost , its update time , its interpretability , etc. a new similarity measure has been proposed recently by several authors ( &name &name , &name &name , &name &name , 
^ d. &name and others ) which exploits the " probabilistic language model " paradigm . 
^ this new measure offers new exciting possibilities for &name , as well as some limitations . 
^ its differences with the " probabilistic &name " model ( &name &name and &name &name ) are still subject of debate . 
^ in this talk i will describe the &num models and sketch its differences and similarities . 
^ i will then explore some new venues opened by the language model , in domains on the fringes of natural language processing and information retrieval . 
^ ( all welcome - for instructions on how to get to the &org , please see : &website )
