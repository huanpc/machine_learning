^  ame ^ in my chamber-window lies a book : bring it hither to me in the orchard . ^  ame ^ i am here already , sir . ^  ame ^ i know that ; but i would have thee hence , and here again . ^  ame  ame ^ i do much wonder that  um man , seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviors to love , will , after he hath laughed at such shallow follies in others , become the argument of his own scorn by failing in love : and such a man is  ame . ^ i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the  ame ; and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe : i have known when he would have walked  um mile a-foot to see a good armour ; and now will he lie  um nights awake , carving the fashion of a new doublet . ^ he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose , like an honest man and a soldier ; and now is he turned orthography ; his words are a very fantastical banquet , just so many strange dishes . ^ may i be so converted and see with these eyes ? ^ i cannot tell ; i think not : i will not be sworn , but love may transform me to an oyster ; but i 'll take my oath on it , till he have made an oyster of me , he shall never make me such a fool . ^  um woman is fair , yet i am well ; another is wise , yet i am well ; another virtuous , yet i am well ; but till all graces be in  um woman ,  um woman shall not come in my grace . ^  ame she shall be , that 's certain ; wise , or i 'll none ; virtuous , or i 'll never cheapen her ; fair , or i 'll never look on her ; mild , or come not near me ; noble , or not i for an angel ; of good discourse , an excellent musician , and her hair shall be of what colour it please  ame . ^  ame ! ^ the prince and monsieur love ! ^ i will hide me in the arbour . ^ withdraws ^  ame  ame  ame ,  ame , and  ame ^  ame  ame ^  ame , shall we hear this music ? ^  ame ^  ame , my good lord . ^ how still the evening is , as hush 'd on purpose to grace harmony ! ^  ame  ame ^ see you where  ame hath hid himself ? ^  ame ^  har , very well , my lord : the music ended , we 'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth . ^ enter balthasar with music ^  ame  ame ^  ame ,  ame , we 'll hear that song again . ^ balthasar ^  har , good my lord , tax not so bad a voice to slander music any more than once . ^  ame  ame ^ it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on his own perfection . ^ i pray thee , sing , and let me woo no more . ^ balthasar ^ because you talk of wooing , i will sing ; since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinks not worthy , yet he wooes , yet will he swear he loves . ^  ame  ame ^ now , pray thee , come ; or , if thou wilt hold longer argument , do it in notes . ^ balthasar ^ note this before my notes ; there 's not a note of mine that 's worth the noting . ^  ame  ame ^ why , these are very crotchets that he speaks ; note , notes , forsooth , and nothing . ^ air ^  ame ^ now , divine air ! ^ now is his soul ravished ! ^ is it not strange that sheeps " guts should  ame souls out of men 's bodies ? ^ well , a horn for my money , when all 's done . ^ the  ame ^ balthasar ^  ame no more , ladies , sigh no more , men were deceivers ever ,  um foot in sea and one on shore , to  um thing constant never : then sigh not so , but let them go , and be you blithe and bonny , converting all your sounds of woe into hey nonny , nonny . ^ sing no more ditties , sing no moe , of dumps so dull and heavy ; the fraud of men was ever so , since summer first was leafy : then sigh not so , &  har . ^  ame  ame ^ by my troth , a good song . ^ balthasar ^ and an ill singer , my lord . ^  ame  ame ^  ame , no , no , faith ; thou singest well enough for a shift . ^  ame ^ an he had been a dog that should have howled thus , they would have hanged him : and i pray  ame his bad voice bode no mischief . ^ i had as lief have heard the night-raven , come what plague could have come after it . ^  ame  ame ^  ame , marry , dost thou hear ,  ame ? ^ i pray thee , get us some excellent music ; for to-morrow night we would have it at the  ame  ame 's chamber-window . ^ balthasar ^ the best i can , my lord . ^  ame  ame ^ do so :  ame . ^  ame balthasar ^ come hither ,  ame . ^ what was it you told me of to-day , that your niece  ame was in love with  ame  ame ? ^  ame ^  har , ay : stalk on . ^ stalk on ; the fowl sits . ^ i did never think that lady would have loved any man . ^  ame ^ no , nor i neither ; but most wonderful that she should so dote on  ame  ame , whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor . ^  ame ^ is 't possible ? ^ sits the wind in that corner ? ^  ame ^ by my troth , my lord ,  um cannot tell what to think of it but that she loves him with an enraged affection : it is past the infinite of thought . ^  ame  ame ^  ame be she doth but counterfeit . ^  ame ^  ame , like enough . ^  ame ^  har  ame , counterfeit ! ^ there was never counterfeit of passion came so near the life of passion as she discovers it . ^  ame  ame ^ why , what effects of passion shows she ? ^  ame ^  ame the hook well ; this fish will bite . ^  ame ^ what effects , my lord ? ^ she will sit you , you heard my daughter tell you how . ^  ame ^ she did , indeed . ^  ame  ame ^ how , how , pray you ? ^ you amaze me : i would have i thought her spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection . ^  ame ^ i would have sworn it had , my lord ; especially against  ame . ^  ame ^ i should think this a gull , but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it : knavery cannot , sure , hide himself in such reverence . ^  ame ^ he hath ta' en the infection : hold it up . ^  ame  ame ^  ame she made her affection known to  ame ? ^  ame ^ no ; and swears she never will : that 's her torment . ^  ame ^ " tis true , indeed ; so your daughter says : 'shall i , " says she , " that have so oft encountered him with scorn , write to him that i love him ? " ^  ame ^ this says she now when she is beginning to write to him ; for she 'll be up  um times a night , and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper : my daughter tells us all . ^  ame ^ now you talk of a sheet of paper , i remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of . ^  ame ^  har , when she had writ it and was reading it over , she found  ame and  ame between the sheet ? ^  ame ^ that . ^  ame ^  har , she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence ; railed at herself , that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her ; " i measure him , " says she , " by my own spirit ; for i should flout him , if he writ to me ; yea , though i love him , i should . " ^  ame ^ then down upon her knees she falls , weeps , sobs , beats her heart , tears her hair , prays , curses ; "  har sweet  ame ! ^  ame give me patience ! " ^  ame ^ she doth indeed ; my daughter says so : and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage to herself : it is very true . ^  ame  ame ^ it were good that  ame knew of it by some other , if she will not discover it . ^  ame ^ to what end ? ^ he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse . ^  ame  ame ^ an he should , it were an alms to hang him . ^ she 's an excellent sweet lady ; and , out of all suspicion , she is virtuous . ^  ame ^ and she is exceeding wise . ^  ame  ame ^ in every thing but in loving  ame . ^  ame ^  har , my lord ,  ame and blood combating in so tender a body , we have  um proofs to one that blood hath the victory . ^ i am sorry for her , as i have just cause , being her uncle and her guardian . ^  ame  ame ^ i would she had bestowed this dotage on me : i would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself . ^ i pray you , tell  ame of it , and hear what  har " will say . ^  ame ^ were it good , think you ? ^  ame ^  ame thinks surely she will die ; for she says she will die , if he love her not , and she will die , ere she make her love known , and she will die , if he woo her , rather than she will bate  um breath of her accustomed crossness . ^  ame  ame ^ she doth well : if she should make tender of her love , " tis very possible he 'll scorn it ; for the man , as you know all , hath a contemptible spirit . ^  ame ^ he is a very proper man . ^  ame  ame ^ he hath indeed a good outward happiness . ^  ame ^ before  ame ! ^ and , in my mind , very wise . ^  ame  ame ^ he doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit . ^  ame ^ and i take him to be valiant . ^  ame  ame ^ as  ame , i assure you : and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise ; for either he avoids them with great discretion , or undertakes them with a most christian-like fear . ^  ame ^ if he do fear  ame ,  har " must necessarily keep peace : if he break the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling . ^  ame  ame ^ and so will he do ; for the man doth fear  ame , howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make . ^ well i am sorry for your niece . ^ shall we go seek  ame , and tell him of her love ? ^  ame ^ never tell him , my lord : let her wear it out with good counsel . ^  ame ^  ame , that 's impossible : she may wear her heart out first . ^  ame  ame ^ well , we will hear further of it by your daughter : let it cool the while . ^ i love  ame well ; and i could wish he would modestly examine himself , to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady . ^  ame ^ my lord , will you walk ? ^ dinner is ready . ^  ame ^ if he do not dote on her upon this , i will never trust my expectation . ^  ame  ame ^ let there be the same net spread for her ; and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry . ^ the sport will be , when they hold one an opinion of another 's dotage , and no such matter : that 's the scene that i would see , which will be merely a dumb-show . ^ let us send her to call him in to dinner . ^  ame  ame  ame ,  ame , and  ame ^  ame ^ [ coming forward ] this can be no trick : the conference was sadly borne . ^ they have the truth of this from  ame . ^ they seem to pity the lady : it seems her affections have their full  ame  ame . ^ love me ! ^ why , it must be requited . ^ i hear how i am censured : they say i will bear myself proudly , if i perceive the love come from her ; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection . ^ i did never think to marry : i must not seem proud : happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending . ^ they say the lady is fair ; " tis a truth , i can bear them witness ; and virtuous ; " tis so ,  um cannot reprove it ; and wise , but for loving me ; by my troth , it is no addition to her wit , nor no great argument of her folly , for i will be horribly in love with her . ^ i may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me , because i have railed so long against marriage : but doth not the appetite alter ? ^ a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age . ^ shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humour ? ^ no , the world must be peopled . ^ when i said i would die a bachelor , i did not think i should live till i were married . ^ here comes  ame . ^ by this day ! ^ she 's a fair lady : i do spy some marks of love in her . ^  ame  ame ^  ame ^ against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner . ^  ame ^  ame  ame , i thank you for your pains . ^  ame ^ i took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to thank me : if it had been painful , i would not have come . ^  ame ^ you take pleasure then in the message ? ^  ame ^  ame , just so much as you may take upon a knife 's point and choke a daw withal . ^ you have no stomach , signior : fare you well . ^  ame ^  ame ^  ame ! ^ " against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner ; " there 's a double meaning in that " i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me . " that 's as much as to say , any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks . ^ if i do not take pity of her , i am a villain ; if i do not love her , i am a jew . ^ i will go get her picture . ^  ame ^  ame  ame  ame  um  um  um ^  ame  har ,  ame  ame 's  ame ,  ame 's  ame ,  ame ,  ame  um ^ st.  ame 's college ^  um  ame  ame  ame dh1  ame ^ department of geological sciences university of  ame </text_normal></message_body></message>
