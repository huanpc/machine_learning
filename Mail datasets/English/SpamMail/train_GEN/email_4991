^ hey &name , 
^ sorry for the delay in responding ... as you know , i have been travelling . 
^ &name was really cool . 
^ after i left , &num thought " i do n't even need to see &org - this is where i want to go " . 
^ but i went to &org anyway , and it was potentially even cooler . 
^ so this means that i definitely want to do a phd . 
^ but this also means that i might have to &name a coin to decide the next &num years of my life &smiley 
^ your other email is still in the time-space warp unless it was returned to you . 
^ i never got it &smiley 
^ glad you want to stay in &name with me &smiley &name can be a scary county to tour alone . 
^ those crazy &name might take advantage of me if you are n't there to protect me . 
^ &name , we should probably find a place to stay in &name or &name at some point . 
^ let me know if you find anything , and i 'll look as well . 
^ &name would be good , as we have already spent about $ &num ( $ &num each ) on just &num nights . 
^ oh , by the way , whilst in &name i met this guy from &name ( the capital of &name ) . 
^ really nice guy , and he talked very highly about his city ( it is halfway between &name and &name ) . 
^ i would like to take a day trip there ... also &name ( this guy ) offered to show us around if we wanted . 
^ i think we should take him up on his offer ( but forget the &name girl ) . 
^ let me know what you think . 
^ also , i met a girl from &name . 
^ she said we had to visit &name ( which is conveniant for us since we will probably have to go through it to get from &name to &name ) . 
^ apparently there is some dragon we should see . 
^ she wo n't be in &name when we are there , though . 
^ &name all is well , &name 
^ on &name , &num mar &num &email wrote :
