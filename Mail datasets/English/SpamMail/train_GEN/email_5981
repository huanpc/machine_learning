^ dear &name , 
^ i still do n't know if you are getting these emails , but here 's another try . 
^ &name and &name are thinking of coming up to &name for a day next week because &name wants to see the spring flowers ( snowdrops and aconites ) along the backs . 
^ do you know if they are out now ? 
^ does the park & ride operate daily or only saturdays ? 
^ i saw &name ( &name ) last week . 
^ &name has been taken over by the germans and more or less closed down , so at &num and &num months she has no job , but no intention of accepting retirement ! 
^ the christmas cactus has flowered and is looking lovely . 
^ mum
