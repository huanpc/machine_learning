^ that is exactly the point . 
^ &name is releated to &name - it has the same function . 
^ first , &name 's word processor is called word , not &name ( even though the executable might still be called that , which was done to avoid conflict with the &name version of word unless i 'm mistaken ) . 
^ and even if they are both word processors , i do n't think it benefits a non-technical user to believe &name is word .

^ &website is &name &name ( &num words ) . 
^ they are shortening it into word in official publications only when it can be justified with style . 
^ ad rem . 
^ i like &char convention . 
^ the only better thing with that would be making from &char not only convention but sign of &name quality . 
^ applications designed for &name could have k at the beginning only after audit from usability ( &name ) and programmer ( eg use of kdelibs ) teams . 
^ but because this in unforceable i can only dream ... * sigh * .
