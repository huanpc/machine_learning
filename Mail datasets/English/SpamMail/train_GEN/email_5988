^ sorry to hear you 're not well . 
^ will pray for you & ask others to do so too . 
^ thanks get plenty of rest & do n't worry about post-concert stuff or work or anything .. just concentrate on getting better ! 
^ i will need at some point to get you to sign the thank you cards ( once i 've actually written them all ) . 
^ are you up to having visitors , or would you rather i left them in an envelope attached to your door to deal with when you feel up to it ? 
^ well i think i 'm feeling a lot better today than yesterday when i just slept the whole time- at least today i 've been pretending to do some physics in bed &smiley i 'm kind of hoping that maybe i 'll be up to lectures tomorrow , but i think it 's really a case of taking &num day at a time ... as for cards , you could just see if &char respond to a knock at the door- if i do n't, then i 'm probably asleep and will find the cards when &char wake up- then i 'll sign them , email you , and get a friend to leave them in my p' hole for you to pick up . 
^ but if i do hear you knocking then i certainly wo n't mind you coming in &smiley 
^ and yes , we can praise &name that we were at least ill at different times and so things have been able to keep going - sorry that i left you with the pre-concert rush and i get the gentle post-concert activity !

^ well the hardest thing was trying to stop you from doing too much while you were ill ( i 'm using past tense- but are you actually feeling better now ? ? ) - i 'm sorry to leave you with all the loose ends- but do pass anything on to me that does n't involve going out in the cold ! 
^ and of course , i 'll let you know when i 'm up and about again .

^ hi &name , just thought i 'd better let you know that i 'm not all that well now ( ! ) so i apologise if i 'm slow at replying to emails and doing post-concert stuff ... having said that , do n't just stop writing emails to me- the extra time in bed not working may well just give me more time to think about these things &smiley praise &name that the timing of our illnesses was such that at least one of us was on hand to sort things out ! 
^ see you , love &name
