^ hi &name , how are you ? 
^ hope you 're not too stressed either &smiley my work 's getting on ... slowly ... 
^ glad it was good at barnies , yep , &name was good too , thanks . 
^ it would be cool to meet up some time re long term mission work- although i hope you realise i 'm hardly an expert on the subject , having lots of questions about it myself ! 
^ tomorrow seems to be the only possible day for both of us before &name 27th , which i hope to take off although it may depend on whether i 'll be ready to hand in a lit review the next day ... 
^ then any time after that monday will be a lot easier for me- well , as long as it 's not during my exam week ( end of may ) . 
^ i 'll try to check emails again at least by tomorrow morning , so if tomorrow 's best for you then name a time- although we 're having a small bible study / &name for those of us who are around in college in the evening , so during the day would be preferable . 
^ &name that all makes sense ! 
^ if i do n't see you before , i hope you have a great time at &name harvest ! 
^ take care , love &name

^ hi 
^ hope you 're not too stressed with work at the moment ! 
^ was yesterday evening 's service good at &name ? 
^ &name was very good and i was made to feel very welcome which was nice . 
^ as i said yesterday , i 'll really like to chat with you sometime about long term missionary work and some of the things which are on my mind about it . 
^ i know you 're kinda busy at the moment , and i 'm at &name harvest between thursday and tuesday inclusive . 
^ but i 'm flexible around the rest of the time , so let me know if you 're happy to do so and when you 're free if so ! 
^ take care , 
^ love
