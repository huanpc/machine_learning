^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for the emails - you obviously had a great time away ! 
^ as to the creation / &name earth business . 
^ do n't get too upset about it . 
^ i think people are doing a great deal of harm , but they are usually willing to say &name is white when pressed . 
^ saying that radiometric dating is unreliable is as silly as saying radio waves are unreliable ( when you change to channel &num , you usually get something with pictures and sound , unless there is a freak weather situation ) . 
^ likewise dating . 
^ when several different decay schemes are used on the same rock , each with its own different half life , and give the same age ( concordance ) the method ca n't be said to be false . 
^ the half lives of some decay schemes are among the most precisely measured constants in physics - e.g. the &name clock which now replaces our world 's measurement of time . 
^ &name can go wrong - things such as weathering , or reheating rocks above their &name temperature ( which resets their clocks ) can occur - but they are the analog of the freak weather conditions in the tv example - understandable situations which can usually be checked . 
^ i also do n't believe our &name plays silly games with us . 
^ he would not give us the gift of scientific enquiry only to turn round and say - &name ha ! 
^ i only put those old-looking fossils there to fool you . 
^ i think a lot of the problems people with a young earth viewpoint have stem with a fear that &num day science may pull the carpet of faith from under them . 
^ but if &name has made everything , science will never undermine what he 's done or prove he did n't do it ! 
^ below i have lifted out bits of articles from the christians in science website . 
^ it is well worth looking at some of the material there , and following links to other articles and books . 
^ &name the term goes well ( and exams are not too harsh )

^ unfortunately the 20th century has witnessed a revival of biblical scholasticism in some circles , often alienating the scientific community from the gospel quite unnecessarily in the process . 
^ to take a specific example , following centuries of " industry and &name " the scientific evidence that the earth we inhabit is many millions of years old has become overwhelming . 
^ it requires a deliberate refusal to face the evidence , worthy of an ostrich , &name , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &name &name : from shintaro by tiggr id ( &email ) ; wed , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &name &name : ( &email ) &name : &email &name : &name &name &name &name version &num ( &num ) &name : wed , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &num to : &email from : " &name &name " ( &email ) subject : &name &name &name &name &name : &num &name : text / plain ; charset' us-ascii " &name : found to be clean sender : &email &name : bulk status : ro 
^ please note that that the assessment test will be on tuesday 26th &name at 3.30pm in &name &num and on wednesday morning at &num am in &name &num . 
^ i would like as many people as possible to attend the tuesday pm session in &name to ovoid overcrowding the mineralogy lab . 
^ on wednesday morning . 
^ the test will consist of a polished block containing &num ore mineral . 
^ the optical properties of the mineral must be described and the mineral identified . 
^ in addition there are &num questions based on the lecture and practical material done up until tuesday of next week : that means that material from next tuesdays lecture will be in the test . 
^ in order to make the test consistent with previous years this will now be a closed book test , and no text books or notes , including practical notes will be allowed . 
^ &name
