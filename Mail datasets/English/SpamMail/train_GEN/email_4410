^ dear &name , thank you for your email and text ... we were very envious ; would have loved to join you in the snow ! 
^ we had a tiny flurry , the children went running out into the playground , beside themselves with excitement , made a couple of snowballs , mainly from the grit on the ground because there was n't really enough snow , and then they were back inside freezing cold ! 
^ . . . ... looking forward very much to seeing you this weekend ; your boots have you . . ... mummyxxxxx

^ dear &name , thanks for your email . 
^ so glad the food has been a success . 
^ abi and &char are here on our own as daddy is taking &name back to &name . 
^ the house looks a little different from when you were here last as daddy discoverred yesterday that that pillar in the kitchen that we hoped was holding up the ceiling wasnt at all . . ... it was resting on a piece of carpet alone ! ! ! 
^ so it is no longer in our kitchen and the ceiling is still in place . 
^ trust all is well with you .
