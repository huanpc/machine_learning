^ version 
<text_embedded> 

^ of your " innosetup &name &name " i could bundle with the product .

^ command 
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ line parameters which would be the executable to affect , and the icon to replace with . 
^ i would actually prefer no &name , maybe just some file logging . 
^ if you 're interested we can work out a fair arrangement .
