^ &name : a synthetic talking face as a telephone communication aid for the hearing impaired 
^ speaker : &name &name - university college &name 
^ &name : 
^ it has been well documented that visual speech information is an important addition to auditory speech communication . 
^ for the severely hearing impaired , the visual channel is often the primary means through which phonetic information is transferred . 
^ hearing impaired persons are thus substantially handicapped in telephone communication . 
^ the goal of the &name project is to develop a multilingual synthetic talking face , driven by an automatic speech recogniser , to assist the hearing impaired with telephone communication . 
^ previous experiments with a swedish synthetic face have shown that synthesised visual face movements can enhance speech intelligibility in hearing impaired users ( &name et &name . ) . 
^ i will describe the technology involved in creating a voice-controlled synthetic talking face . 
^ i will also present results from multilingual perceptual experiments indicating the promising prospect of the synthetic face as an aid for the hearing impaired .
