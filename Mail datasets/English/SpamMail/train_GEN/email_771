^ &name , 
^ 'my sister is in love with you &name , she 's not . 
^ - what ? ! 
^ i 'm confused . 
^ does this have anything to do with a certain photograph ? 
^ whether or not the incidents are related , i wish that photo be destroyed instantly. ( ! ) 
^ " it will do you good to get that messy paste all over your hands ! 
^ - i disagree . 
^ my manager disagrees . 
^ the &name 's &name - relations team disagrees . 
^ " you might remember him [ &name ] 
^ - yes , i do . 
^ i had the privilege to shake his hand on the stairs of &num &name &name earlier this year . 
^ " i just do n't want to learn about requirements engineering i just do n't! 
^ - you mean , you do n't want to learn about it ? 
^ subtlety is a craft you have undoubtedly attained mastery of . 
^ now , &name &name 
^ regarding your communication dated 13th december &num in which you stated that ; " &num [ &name ] have similar characteristics to an amphibious-type creature who has evolved &num million years in a few hours and has mysteriously taken on the form of a large slug with uncontrollable mating habits . 
^ these personal revelations slightly worried me . 
^ so much so that i referred your case to the good doctor &name . 
^ so full of humility is she that she denied having any medical skill but nevertheless submitted the following observations to the " what to do about &name 's rare illness board of &name 
^ 'sounds worrying . 
^ we have a slug for a cu rep ? 
^ perhaps worse : a cu rep with the characteristics of a slug . 
^ worse still : you have a flat-mate with the characteristics of a slug . 
^ so , &name is slow , leaves slim wherever he goes , and has " uncontrollable mating habits . 
^ talk to him . 
^ ask him what the problem is . 
^ one of the things i do n't get about guys is the way they bottle things up and do n't talk to others about . 
^ i think that &name has been somewhat stressed . 
^ therefore , &name &name , the board of enquiry hereby diagnoses you with 'slug-stress-syndrome , a rare illness that stems from too much time around " female computers . 
^ the side effects are varied and generally devastating . 
^ the following web-site is available for those who feel that this disease will push them over " the edge : &website . 
^ anyway &name , it was a shame you could n't make it to chat last night . 
^ in the end , &name , &name , &name and i turned up . 
^ we talked for about an hour . 
^ an uninvited guest turned up , calling himself " &name . 
^ we do n't know who he was , but he was very nasty and called us names , like " elitists and " cliquey ( only he called it " clicky and &name corrected him ) . 
^ &name told him she was delighted to be an elitist if it meant she could spell correctly . 
^ then we all told him to go away and learn to spell , and i told him to learn grammar too . 
^ it was quite amusing , and &name was quite rude towards him ! 
^ ( by the way , &name says his computer automatically changes his words to what he really means to say hence the interesting combinations of letters issuing forth from his direction . ) i just hope we do n't actually know &name " &name . 
^ it would be awful if it turned out to be someone we 'd invited to chat it was n't you was it ? 
^ so &name , is &name going to get &name &name &name service ? 
^ i 've got it on &name now it has wonderful potential . 
^ i 'm going down to &name on &name &name , primarily so my grandmother can see where i 'm at university . 
^ is there anything you 'd like me to do ? 
^ well , how are you settling into your house ? 
^ are you looking forward to christmas ? 
^ what will you be doing at &num : &num on the 29th of december ? 
^ do you want to know the history of &name ? 
^ this is a possible version of events 
^ well , a long time ago in the delta &name [ all my stories start there , it 's such a happening place ] there was a young computer named &name . 
^ she was a very lonely computer and often wondered where her future lay . 
^ she desperately wished that she could have a young computer programmer to love and &name . 
^ &num day , she met a raven . 
^ this raven was called " &num [ translates to " &name remember him ] and an aura of &name enveloped him . 
^ in fact , it enveloped him so thickly that young &name could n't even see him , so she relied on her &name &name &name &name system ( logos , greek " the word ) . 
^ anyway , &name and &name had a heart to binary-matrix talk , the outcome of which changed &name 's hard disk forever . 
^ shortly after their conversation ( for &name was very impetuous ) &name successfully pleaded with &name to transport her to earth . 
^ that gallant raven obliged , and , &name met up with a strange young man . 
^ her first observation was that he had similar characteristics to an amphibious-type creature who had evolved &num million years in a few hours and had mysteriously taken on the form of a large slug with uncontrollable mating habits . 
^ however , she could cope with that as she was a very interesting computer herself . 
^ anyway , she introduced herself to the young computer scientist ( for that was what he was ) who fell head over heels in love with her ( he was good at gymnastics ) . 
^ &name ( for that was this intriguing young programmer 's name ) and &name were inseparable after that particular display of gymnastics &name being very impressed with his general humility and speed of speech patterns . 
^ the end or just the beginning ? 
^ &name well , &name , i think i shall do something else . 
^ i look forward with delight and the promise of joy to your next communication . 
^ also , i ca n't believe voyager is not on television this week ! 
^ until the next time of correspondence , 
^ &name [ y] [ o] [ in] [ this list is getting longer ]
