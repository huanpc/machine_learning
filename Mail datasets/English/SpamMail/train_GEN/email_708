^ &name , and welcome to this email on behalf of &name ... 
^ i went up to &name today ( where &name is completing the second part of her training ) to see &name , and she desired me to send you this , as she has little access to email , altho " she will shortly . 
^ apologies for information which some of you know ; it bears repeating . 
^ &name is working for youth for &name doing advanced sports evangelism , and as of next week will be based in &name , en &name . 
^ she will be living with her boss , &name , who is about &num , and the other member of the team , &char / &name , who is about &num years younger than &name . 
^ she has been training with them and &num others ( who will form a team in the &name ) . 
^ ok , i 'm now going to paraphrase what &name asked me to tell you ... 
^ &name is feeling very blessed that &name has saught to use her talents in a way that she will enjoy . 
^ she feels that she has a particular calling this year towards girls , and getting alongside them- she is looking forward to doing &num , and possibly to coaching some hockey as well as football . 
^ she is glad to be in &name , and her time in &name has made her thankful for the great provision &name is making for her . 
^ on a slightly less-good note , she is finding the training quite hard , as the other trainees are all boys , and are from differing backgrounds to herself . 
^ while she is glad that &name is challenging her to come out of her comfort zone , being the oldest , most mature and only female member of the team can sometimes be trying for her . 
^ please ( if you want to ) pray for all of the above , and ask for security for &name as a lone girl , her safety may be called into question . 
^ i had such a wonderful time with &name it was fabulous to see her , and see how faithfully she is prepared to adhere to &name 's plans for her . 
^ her time in &name has developed her leadership skills , and the photos were fantastic- such a beautiful place . 
^ finally , if i have missed anyone vital from the email list , please let me know . 
^ &name will have email next week , so feel free to reply to her . 
^ with love ,
