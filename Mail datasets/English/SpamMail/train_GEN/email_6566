^ okay , 
^ i have n't posted it yet so we 'll forget about it . 
^ regards 
^ &name &name 
^ since neither have i received the processor , nor you the money and i am going down tomorrow , if you have not sent the processor yet , then i think it might 
^ be more sensible just to call off the transaction . 
^ if you have sent it and it has simply not arrived yet in &name , then either i can post you the money ( undergrads do n't have access to &name , only &name which is collegiate only ) or 
^ wait until next term when i can deliver it in person .
