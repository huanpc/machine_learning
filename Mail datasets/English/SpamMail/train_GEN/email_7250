^ i feel that each class in lima.mathematical.factorization and lima.mathematical.utilities needs testing . 
^ and ideally each individual class of &name . 
^ please e-mail sometime tonight about the above and also whether you can make the additional meeting in place of this evenings one you could n't make .
