^ dear chorus members , 
^ tonight the &name school for girls is having a concert in the &name &name , so it 's back to the recital room for us , which means enough people arriving reasonably early in order to shift the tables . 
^ as you know it 's pretty squashed in there and the people who arrive last may find themselves standing up all evening . 
^ on the other hand with a little extra care it might be possible to stack the tables in such a way that there 's a little more room for chairs . 
^ &name has agreed that we can take our break in the concert interval so that if you need to leave the room you wo n't have to be silent , but i 'm afraid there wo n't be any interval drinks tonight , not because of the concert , but because i forgot to go to the cash " &char carry to buy some more mugs - sorry ! ! 
^ please remember that unless both pairs of doors into the rec room are kept shut our sound can be heard on stage . 
^ you actually have to pull the inside door to , because it gets stuck on the carpet ! 
^ i 'm sure we shall manage beautifully and the school wo n't know that we 're there at all ! 
^ cheers , &name
