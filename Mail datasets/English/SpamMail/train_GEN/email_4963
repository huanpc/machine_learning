^ hey &name , 
^ i made a few minor changes and i am sending it back to you . 
^ that way you can send it to &name since you did most of the work . 
^ however , if by tomorrow you still have n't sent it , then i will assume that you ca n't log into the cs server and i will go ahead and send it , but explain that you wrote it . 
^ i will show you the changes that i made on monday - i hope you will agree .
