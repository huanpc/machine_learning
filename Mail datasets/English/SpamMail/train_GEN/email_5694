^ hi everyone , 
^ just to remind you of the brunch details : 
^ it will be held from 12-3pm , sunday 8th , december in the &name &name &name bar - due to increased numbers , we have not been able to host it in the &name as planned . 
^ the bar is the first left after the porter 's lodge , but in any case , the porter will show you where it is - not very complicated ! 
^ please bring cheques made out to " &name &name &name &name " for &pound; &num per person .
