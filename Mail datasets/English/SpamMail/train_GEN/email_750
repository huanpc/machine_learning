^ news is fast coming in of a reported sighting of &name , the raven who doubles as an intergalactic emissary . 
^ an eye-witness source confirmed the sighting to our special reporter . 
^ here are the latest details in this developing situation 
^ date of sighting : saturday 8th july &num &name : in a tree near &name 
^ &name is a little known area in &name 's national park . 
^ exact location : &name : 54 &num ; &num &num &name &name : 1 &num ; &num &num &name 
^ our eye-witness source is a &name &name from &name . 
^ appearing rather bemused she told our reporter she was convinced that i saw him , later making the omission that i may be entirely wrong : it may not have been &name who i saw . 
^ her fascinating ideas on the reason for &name to be so far north are as follows ; 
^ i am sure that he has got wind of the fact that &name is now stationed in &name , and he was on his way there . 
^ as the raven flies , &name is directly midway between &name and &name 's home . 
^ is this just a stunning coincidence ? 
^ when we asked &name to comment he retorted sardonically that any idea that he is making his way to see me is pure speculation and i really cannot comment on what seems a rather absurd notion . 
^ &name 's immediate response to this unveiled attack on her sanity is unprintable . 
^ however , she did later make the following public statement , i have a programme whereby you can distort photos and make people 's noses and ears bigger or whatever you fancy . 
^ when questioned further , she just smiled in an unsettling kind of way . 
^ our editor wisely noted that there could be trouble ahead here . 
^ &name 's account of &name 's behaviour shed 's little light on the situation ; 
^ he was so evidently grumpy ( squawking &name and viciously attacking the surrounding tree branches ) that i can only assume that his tracking devices are causing problems for him . 
^ ( &name is a technical term . ) 
^ what could have made &name so mad ? 
^ is &name telling the whole truth or hiding some vital information ? 
^ &name suggested that you may have to resort to contacting &name &name ( different is spelled r.i.g.h.t. ) about it so that he can telepathically communicate with &name and put him back on the right course . 
^ a very good idea and one which we are following up as you read . 
^ however , there is only &num person who can tell us what we need to know , and that 's &name but where is &name ? 
^ &name is heading the section detailed to locate the renegade raven . 
^ we asked her what her strategy was for finding the emissary . 
^ her spokesman said she has her whole family looking out for a dumb-looking raven . 
^ &char leaked report from &name 's &name &name ltd. later informed us that he had been subsequently sacked for dissing the undefiled name of &name , pending an official investigation by the &name &name council . 
^ we will keep you updated in this important state of affairs . 
^ remember , keep your eyes open for &name . 
^ all sightings should be reported to the official hunt for &name &name &name . 
^ telephone number &num &num &num . 
^ please ask for &name before describing you sighting in detail to those of the establishment without the required security clearance . 
^ thank you .
