^ a copy of something i sent to &char &name . 
^ yesterday was the varsity ice hockey &name . 
^ we left &name at &num : &num after church and got to &name around &num : &num to have some lunch with &name . 
^ he had had a good day on saturday with various events around the game . 
^ the honourary captains from the 1930's teams ( aged over &num ) apparently greatly enjoyed it all and passed on good stories . 
^ had a short walk around &name with &name 's uncle &name and &name and &name 's friend &name both of whom had come with us . 
^ &name came for a brief time then left to get ready . 
^ &name stayed with &name in &name 's room as he said he was n't feeling up to a walk . 
^ got to the game early to find a good sized queue . 
^ met up with the &name and a couple of others inside . 
^ the rink was packed ! 
^ &name first period with missed chances for &name , mostly on &name 's line . 
^ no scoring . 
^ in the second , &name continued to get penalties including a &num minute major which shortly after was followed by a minor . 
^ held off the &num minutes &num men down but then &name scored on a relatively long shot through a crowd . 
^ fortunately , a brilliant individual move by the centre on &name 's line ( &name &name , an american ) tied the score before the period ended . 
^ stage set for period &num . 
^ &name seemed to be creating some chances but could n't score . 
^ finally , &name &name again scored with a very nice shot to give them the lead . 
^ fortunately they did not sit back but kept up the pressure . 
^ twice in the next &num minutes or so , &name got the &name in front of the net , put a deke on the goalie and the &name was in ! 
^ there was a little bit of excitement in our section of the stands ! 
^ &name continued to hold in there , conceded a goal in the last &num minutes , but held on for a well deserved &num victory . 
^ with all the special preparation for this centenary game , and because a lot of the team were playing their last varsity &name , it was a very rewarding win . 
^ on the down side , &name threw up at the end of the game but we did get home without any further problems on that front . 
^ i guess his bug had not quite departed .
