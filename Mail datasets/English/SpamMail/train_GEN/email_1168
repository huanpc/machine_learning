women who were once educators or doctors or simply used to basic human freedoms are now severely restricted and treated as subhuman in the name of right-wing fundamentalist islam . ^ it is not their tradition or " culture , " but it is alien to them , and it is extreme even for those cultures where fundamentalism is the rule . ^ everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence , even if they are women in a muslim country . ^ if we can threaten military force in  ame in the name of human rights for the sake of ethnic  ame , citizens of the world can certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression , murder and injustice committed against women by the  ame . ^ statement : in signing this , we agree that the current treatment of women in  ame is completely unacceptable and deserves action by  rg and that the current situation overseas will not be tolerated . ^ women 's rights is not a small issue anywhere , and it is unacceptable for women in  um to be treated as subhuman and as so much property . ^  ame and human decency is a fundamental right , not a freedom to be granted , whether one lives in  ame or elsewhere . ^  um )  ame  ame  ame ,  ame city , ca ,  ame  um )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca ,  ame  um )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  ame  um )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  ame  um ) . ^  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca . ^  ame  um ) kit  ame ,  ame , ca  ame  um )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  miley  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  ame  ame  ame ,  ame  ame , ca  um )  ame  ame ;
