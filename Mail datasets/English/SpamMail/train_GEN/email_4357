^ hi daddy , 
^ you might be interested in these . 
^ they were entries on the " &name &name " section of a web-site called " friends reunited " which contains lists of old school classes where you can sign-on and find out what your old school-mates are up to . 
^ &num - mr. &name added by &name &name everyone seems to remember the purple-faced ranting &name &name . 
^ he was scary beyond belief , and those of us that were tortured by his maths lessons in that odd " classroom " thing that was in fact partly a corridor ( outside forms &num / &num ) , will probably never forget him . 
^ anyway , in &name &name 's class of &num ( us aged &num ) , we got our own back on &name by singing a version of " &name &name of &name &name " in assembly ( accompanied by &name &name on his trusty guitar ) & changing the words to be rude ( well , rude by our standards at the time ) about &name &name . 
^ he went an indescribable shade of &name if i recall and hid behind the piano ! 
^ oh how we laughed . 
^ &num - &name &num &num added by &name &name my other teachers that i can remember , in order , were : &name &name ( lovely old lady ) , &name &name ( strict , but nicer to the girls ) , &name &name , &name &name ( &name hair ) / &name &name ( not sure of spelling but you know who i mean ) , &name &name ( good fun ) , and &name &name . 
^ thinking back , primary school was n't bad - and loads of my ex-classmates are now primary school teachers themselves . 
^ mad . 
^ lots of love daddy !
