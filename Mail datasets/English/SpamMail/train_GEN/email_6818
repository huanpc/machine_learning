^ hi all , 
^ please see attachment for the paper outline and task allocation . 
^ this draft will replace earlier draft that i have sent . 
^ ( we need flow charts for the algorithms too ! ) 
^ deadline for submitting your part is &name , please ! ! 
^ nb it 's vital that you submit it by saturday so we have enough time to edit it and publish it . 
^ please email it to both &name and &name . 
^ thank you for your cooperation .
