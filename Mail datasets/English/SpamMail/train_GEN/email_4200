^ hi &name . 
^ back here from a short speaking tour . 
^ gosh , very sorry about your " troubles " . 
^ from your description i was n't quite able to understand the exact situation , but then , heartache is heartache ( sigh ) , and there 's no remedy but to cry out ... and live through it . 
^ so , that 's what i 'm praying for &name , that you 'll not deny your hurt but also know that you will survive this , even flourish in time . 
^ it 's been my experience ( after many such heartaches ! ) that &name is always trustworthy . 
^ take care my friend . 
^ &name

^ crapness beyond crapness . 
^ i have had a really emotionally traumatic last few days . 
^ &name , &name &name ! 
^ i fall in love with the most amazing girl ever , &name , and then in order that i can keep seeing her and it not seem too strange , i ask her out , she excepts and we are both very happy . 
^ then i get a book in my pigeon hole ; boy meets girl , which i take as &name saying - go for it , but do it my way . 
^ amen to that . 
^ then , &name &name ( a friend who graduated &num years ago ) comes round and asks me so many questions that i 'm scared to ask myself - now i ca n't even remember most of them . 
^ i feel awful . 
^ then i go a apologise to &name ( an old friend ) , as i might have hurt her after last term , then find &name and say that i want to have an honest chat with her , and so we talk and pray . 
^ and i hold her in my arms as we do so , and neither one of us want to let go , but &name is saying nothing , but there is now no peace . 
^ and so we after praying some more take this &name saying to split up . 
^ and this morning i feel absolutely awful . 
^ i do n't understand why &name did n't say no beforehand when i asked him . 
^ it makes no sence . 
^ the only possible good thing to come out of this is furthur humbling of me . 
^ that is really what i want ! 
^ i mean , i live my life for &name , sure , but sometimes it would be nice if things happened my way as well . 
^ and &name is so wonderful , and i am still absolutely in love with her , and she with me . 
^ &name , i do n't understand . 
^ &name , i just do n't get it . 
^ hope you are well , please pray for me .
