^ &name farewell 
^ exuberantly cheerful , canadian and sometimes rather crazy ( understatement of the year ! ) , &name is , as he says , " a really great guy " . 
^ in &name 's week he " charmed " everyone with his 'so , on a scale of one to &num " ice breaking questions although since then he has extended his repertoire . 
^ first year saw &name setting up the &name 's photographic society and busying himself with such prestigious tasks as &name &name photography . 
^ often seen with a camera in hand and some enthusiastic initiate in tow this is certainly an interest he has developed . 
^ &char keen fencer , in second year &name delighted and amused his flatmates by practising his skilful moves in their corridor . 
^ he also regaled them with truly mind-expanding geology lectures , serenaded them as he practised his guitar early in the mornings and taught them much about economy . 
^ the words " &name &name " and " cu " are virtually synonymous , as he has demonstrated over his &num years at &name 's. 
^ last year also saw him leading &name 's hall worship every friday in the college chapel . 
^ this year &name made his debut on the hockey field , and a truly unique debut it was . 
^ probably best described as a primeval apeman-tiger hybrid , even the referee had to have words with him and ask him to tone down his enthusiasm . 
^ nothing . 
^ however , could ever dampen his enthusiasm for his ( in ) famous sunday afternoon walks ( &name hikes ! ) , and earlier this year , to his great delight , he found himself a willing companion in the form of the lovely &name &name . 
^ &name really is a great , crazy and trustworthy friend to many try as you may , you ca n't help but like this guy - resistance is , indeed , futile !
