^ &name the exams are going ok . 
^ i gather from &name that things are generally alright with you . 
^ here we had a nice weekend with &name &amp; &name , and did that &num hour walk in just over &num ! 
^ mind you we were all pretty shattered afterwards . 
^ &name and &name had to go into hospital as he was not putting on weight ; they are home now and he is putting on weight but they are still not sure whether there is something wrong with his liver . 
^ &name was working in your bedroom this morning and got a nasty shock as a &name nest fell down from under your desk ! 
^ fortunately it was uninhabited ! 
^ we will check the room before you get back . ... 
^ have you got tickets for the concert yet ? 
^ we must book up with &name and kit for the night if possible ! 
^ do let us know where we are to go etc. 
^ see you soon ( ish ) ! 
^ &name just phoned and asked if you wanted to upgrade to a &num year onsite warranty for &pound; &num plus vat ( a big reduction apparently ) . 
^ unless you get back to us soon ( an email saying " yes to warranty " would be enough ) we will assume , as we think , that you do not want this . 
^ love , mum
