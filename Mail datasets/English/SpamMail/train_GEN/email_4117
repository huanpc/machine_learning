^ &name , are you worried about me or something ? 
^ or are you simply wondering whether i 've died so you get a bigger share in the inheritance ? 
^ with a mean business mind like yours , i suspect the latter , but i 'll give you the benefit of the doubt for now ... 
^ actually , at the moment i feel dreadful . 
^ my legs keep buckling " cause i feel so weak and i had to lie down and sleep this afternoon . 
^ i suspect i 'm just exhausted , but maybe i have n't been eating enough green things . 
^ i had a large salad today , so maybe that will help . 
^ we 'll see . 
^ the mission was good here , and follow-up continues . 
^ i 've just spent a couple hours preparing what will probably be the last cu i lead as rep here ... &name ! 
^ we 're still trying to pick out our new reps . 
^ &name last night was absolutely atrocious , not helped by the fact that one of our guys was sent down ( expelled ) on wednesday , and so has to be out of &name by saturday . 
^ i think most of the guys were just in shock , but also half our team is injured at the moment and i do n't know how we 're going to fare on saturday against the air force big guns ( i really hope they do n't bring any ... guns i mean ) . 
^ actually , i very much like getting your emails and i save every single one of them ; you 're one of the few people to whom i accord that priviledge . 
^ so feel special . 
^ &name , hmm , i have n't heard anything about it from mum ( whose birthday , incidentally , is &name &num , shame on you for not knowing that ) . 
^ i 'm still up for going but only if you are ; i really do n't fancy going on my own . 
^ no one on this end as yet . 
^ &name is well ; have n't you been sending her cool poems this term ? 
^ of course , as &name &num approaches i must decide whether to do anything or simply ignore the day ( as i did last year ) . 
^ any suggestions ? 
^ how 's &name ? 
^ how 's bellringer dude ? 
^ have you killed anyone ( him ? ) with your foil yet ? 
^ my co-rep , &name , is going to start fencing . 
^ do you have any handy hints for him ? 
^ well , i think i 'll send this now and hope that maybe you 're online . 
^ i 'll be sending some more emails for the next few minutes so if you log on send me a message saying you have . 
^ wishing we could enjoy an evening of trek , 
^ &name
