^ hi &name , 
^ i am currently applying to renew my english passport ( i received some advice that is much easier to travel around &name with an english passport than with an american one so i figured that it would be useful to have one for next year ) . 
^ in addition to my own signature , it must also be signed by a countersignatory who can certify that that person has known me for more than &num years and that i am not misrepresenting myself to the british government . 
^ according to the form , the requirements are : 
^ " a british citizen , or other commonwealth citizen , who has known you personally for at least &num years and who is a member of parliament , &name of the peace , minister of religion , &name officer , established civil servant , professionally qualified person , e.g. lawyer , &name , doctor , school teacher , police officer or a person of similar standing . 
^ if you do not know a british citizen or other commonwealth citizen locally with these qualifications , the form may be completed and signed by a citizen of the country in which you are residing , provided he / she has a similar standing in that country and the &name considers his / her signature to be acceptable . 
^ a member of your family should not countersign . " 
^ i was wondering if you would be able to serve as my countersignatory given that you have known me for &num years and are of respectable standing in my country of residence . 
^ if you do n't feel comfortable doing this , do n't worry - i am sure that i can ask my doctor or a different professor or somebody . 
^ &name
