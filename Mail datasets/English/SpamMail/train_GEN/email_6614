^ dear &name , 
^ i have now realised we did n't sort out money before you went back ... i think room was &pound; &num , but ca n't remember what fees are due this time . 
^ let me know and i will either send you a cheque or i could probably just transfer it to your account : the number i have on &name ( &num * * * * &num ) is presumably the right one ?
