^ hi everyone ! 
^ note to &name please email me to tell me how events went , so we can pray accordingly . 
^ do email me if there is anything else you would like prayer for . 
^ thursday 's &name &name 
^ " witness : the evidence ... the truth about &name " 
^ - &name &name that the seed was sown in many people 's hearts . 
^ pray that &name will cause this to grow , and that people will respond with repentance and faith . 
^ &name &num : &num " &name then the parable of the sower . 
^ &num when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it , the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart ; this is what was sown on the path . 
^ &num as for what was sown on rocky ground , this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy ; &num yet such a person has no root , but endures only for a while , and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word , that person immediately falls away . 
^ &num as for what was sown among thorns , this is the one who hears the word , but the cares of the world and the lure of wealth choke the word , and it yields nothing . 
^ &num but as for what was sown on good soil , this is the one who hears the word and understands it , who indeed bears fruit and yields , in &num case a hundredfold , in another &num , and in another &num . " 
^ - pray for those who are showing interest or who prayed the prayer last night , that their response will be genuine faith , and that persecutions or worldly cares will not cause them to fall away , but that they will persevere through them and prove their faith is genuine . 
^ - pray for those who have shown no reaction , hostility , or have completely missed the point of what was said , that &name will prevent &name from snatching the seed from their hearts , and that &name will open their blind eyes to the truth of the message and its relevance to them . 
^ - pray for a guy who heard the talk last night and responded that he would try to live a better life . 
^ pray that he would realise that the christian message is of salvation by grace through faith in &name , and not just a moral code . 
^ - &name &name that he answered our prayers , and despite rail delays due to the weather , &name arrived in time for the talk . 
^ - &name &name for the catering team , who at short notice , moved the hot drinks from the end of the talk to the start . 
^ &name &name that everything ran smoothly . 
^ - &name &name that in his soverignty he used a number of factors including road works and the bad weather to bring a &name girl to the talk , who would not otherwise have come ! 
^ friday 's &name &name 
^ " witness : the evidence ... the truth about death " 
^ - pray for &name giving her testimony , that it will point people to &name , and his work in her life . 
^ pray that her friends will come and be challenged as they hear about &name 's saving grace . 
^ - pray for &name &name , that he will speak clearly , and for his friends , that they will come along . 
^ - pray that people will feel free to stay and chat after the talk . 
^ romans &num : &num for while we were still weak , at the right time &name died for the ungodly . 
^ &num indeed , rarely will anyone die for a righteous person'though perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die . 
^ &num but &name proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners &name died for us . 
^ - &name &name for the awesome truth of his love for us , demonstrated by &name 's death for us on the cross . 
^ - pray that &name would explain clearly the message of the cross , why it had to happen , and what it means for us . 
^ - pray that the weather would not prevent anyone from coming tonight . 
^ - pray for those organising the talks , for the &name , &name , caterers , techies , literature people , &name and &name , and everyone else who will be there early , that those they have invited will come , despite not being able to knock on their doors and bring them . 
^ &name college guests
