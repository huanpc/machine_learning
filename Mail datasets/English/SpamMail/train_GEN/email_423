^ my dearest &name 
^ meet me by the willow trees beside the river tomorrow at midnight . 
^ how shall i recognise you ? 
^ anyway 
^ that was a rather psychedelic e-mail . 
^ i hope the colours do n't represent your moods because if so then you changed from a rather girlish pink to a morbid black , then back to the same pink before becoming a very light ethereal sky blue and ending with a more stable medium blue . 
^ you ought to see a psychologist . 
^ i do n't think that counts as orifice checking , but it 's still important . 
^ i 'd just like to point out , &name , that biology is nothing like chemistry whatsoever . 
^ i do n't really even consider biology a science . 
^ all biologists do is draw pictures of rabbits eating carrots . 
^ chemistry is sooooooo much more sophisticated . 
^ we explode things . 
^ i was n't worried about &name taking on &name 's characteristics , more his parents and mine . 
^ no , i 'm not going down to &name especially to place an advertisement in &name . 
^ honestly &name ! 
^ i would post it if that were the case ! 
^ no , i 'm going down to see the flat . 
^ " &name , why are you studying &name ? 
^ - i 'm studying because i have an enormous amount of work to do before the exams and i want to do better than last year . 
^ i know holidays have only begun , but i 'm bored already . 
^ i did n't know you had asthma . 
^ so , you went for a run . 
^ that 's the problem with living in a city ; when you do something , people see you although they probably do n't notice . 
^ here in the country people notice . 
^ " i am going to my friend 's house tonight to say hello and look at her new extension ( fun ) . 
^ - extension of what ? 
^ " the time thing is very very amusing . 
^ - &name thing ? 
^ do you mean &name 's ear ? 
^ incidentally , due to foot and mouth , we now get our post delivered only to the end of the road , newspapers are no longer delivered , and suspicion reigns . 
^ &name . 
^ it 's very cold here . 
^ i envy you the warm climate of &name . 
^ although , you probably do n't think it 's warm . 
^ now , &name is feeling rather unwell these days , and i think i shall send her a get well card . 
^ would you like to do the same ? 
^ &name 's address is 
^ &num &name road &name park &name &name 3pt 
^ he said goodbye to &name today , i quote 
^ 'miss &name has now left , and therein lies a story : 
^ i was taking her to &name to drop her off with her brother , and she assumed that it would be easy enough to find the place because she knew what it was called &name halls . 
^ thus , she did not ask for directions , and upon arriving in &name , she realised that it was somewhat bigger than she had expected and we would perhaps not be able to just " find the place by knowing its name ! 
^ and so , &num people , a number of text messages and an hour later we eventually found our destination ! 
^ anyway , she is there now and i am emailing you from my living room where &name is currently residing . 
^ see you later , 
^ &name 
^ he often calls me " o fair and wondrous &name strange . 
^ " till tomorrow at midnight , 
^ yours with overwhelming affection , 
^ &name
