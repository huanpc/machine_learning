^ yes it 's another random prayer request from me ! 
^ this one is on behalf of a friend from the mission team i have just come back from . 
^ one of his really close friends , who is n't a christian , is really interested in the summer team and &name , and &name has sent her his diary of the team 
^ - please would you pray that it would really make an impact on her and that she would be interested / find things relevant to her / want to ask questions , and also for &name that he would be able to find the right answers & the right things to say to her - he has been praying about her daily for a long time but he really needs extra support right now . 
^ &name ! 
^ i hope everyone is well - sorry i have been so lax in doing some kind of summary of the summer team - i will hopefully be emailing something out at the end of the week or at the weekend . 
^ tomorrow i should be off to &name &name for a wee while , so in the meantime i 'll be thinking of you - take care & &name bless 
^ loads of love 
^ &name 
^ " work like you do n't need money, * * * &email * ) ( ) love like you 've never been hurt, * * &website / and dance like &num 's watching' * * &website / " love your enemy , it 'll ruin his reputation " &name tutu
