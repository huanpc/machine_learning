^ as you suggested , &num downloaded the &num version , but i still have the problem where &name deletes the files before installshield is finished with them . 
^ as far as i know , this only happens on &name me - &website or whatever it 's called included in the installshield kit . ) 
^ i hate to turn off the 'delete files when done " switch , but the only other alternative is to make separate installation kits for &name . 
^ let me know if i can help you debug this , or if you have any ideas . 
^ thanks .
