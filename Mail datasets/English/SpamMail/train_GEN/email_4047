^ hi guys 
^ i heard from &name again today ... he is heaps better and has gone back to work . 
^ only &num hours ago they were trying to hospitalise him , so this is fantastic news ! 
^ i am very relieved as you can imagine ! 
^ he said : 
^ " this morning i went to the hospital again for that stupid &num session and my favourite doctor was there . 
^ she was most surprised to see that i have almost completely recovered , given the fact that only &num hours ago they were still trying to hospitalise me . 
^ so prayers have been answered and i am delighted to be eating and drinking again and also to be back at work ... something i thought i would never say . 
^ &num slight problem is that i have liver damage as a result of the virus , but all i have to do is avoid alcohol ( hurrah ! ) and be aware that i am prone to sudden exhaustion . 
^ i 'm happy ! 
^ so thanks to you and your chain ! 
^ it really is a miracle as the pills they gave me were doing nothing , and even yesterday the doctor gave me into trouble for being so cheerful , warning me that my condition was very serious and that i could end up blind or sterile as a result of it . " 
^ please do keep him in your prayers - he 's back at work though not fully fit , and i know it has been a real shock to him to be so ill . 
^ thanks for all your prayers , you are all stars , and i know &name is incredibly grateful after the scary and horrible time he has had . 
^ lots of love &name xx
