^ you may have met &name &name , a chinese &num &name youth player . 
^ at the &name open , &name &name had a discussion with his father and discovered that &name would probably really appreciate a &name &num &name certificate . 
^ &char &name &num &name certificate would also be worth something if / when they returned to &name . 
^ now the standard policy is not to award a &name &num &name certificate to a player who is already a foreign &num &name . 
^ i believe that the reason for this policy is a scenario like : japanese &num &name comes to the &name , gets told " &name grades are a bit tougher than japanese grades , you had better play at &num &name " , and does so . 
^ later they justify their &num &name grade , however it would not be appropriate to give them a &name &num &name certificate . 
^ however , i do n't think that this applies here . 
^ i see no reason not to award &name &name a &num &name certificate , if he earns it . 
^ so , i propose that council makes an exception , and asks &name to track &name &name 's promotion points as if from &num &name to &num &name , then recommend a promotion if it becomes justified . 
^ from looking over the results on the &name website , it seems that the only tournaments &name has played are &name , &name and &name last year , scoring &num / &num , &num / &num and &num / &num . 
^ &num games is probable not enough , but since most of the losses have been to &num and &num dans , it is probably just a matter of time . 
^ i make it &num promotion points to &num &name ( & &num to &num &name ) . 
^ &name 's father said that they would probably be going to the youth championship ( even thought they know that &name is not eligible to compete for the title ) , and they will probably be going to some other events too . 
^ &name is now a &name member ( well done &name ) . 
^ &name , if i have mis-remembered any of that , please correct me . 
^ what does everyone think ? 
^ as far as i 'm concerned there 's no reason not to do it if it 's going to be appreciated , unless the council is worried about running out of certificates &smiley 
^ ( &name of the grading committee wo n't be able to post to the council-discussion list , send any messages to me , and i will forward them ) . 
^ &name . 
^ &name &name reports that we had &num members at the end of the year .
