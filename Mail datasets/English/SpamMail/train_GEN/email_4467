^ &name , 
^ i think the best thing is if you just remove all the 8-bit characters . 
^ i 'm not sure everyone will have the same problem , so i do n't really want to do this on all the files , but it is n't worth you trying to find out which piece of code is causing the problem . 
^ the easy way to remove the extended characters is to use tr ( maybe evoke it when you do the unzipping ) 
^ tr &char " &name -' &num " 
^ should do the job 
^ if this seems ok to you , let me know , and i 'll email everyone , 
^ cheers ,
