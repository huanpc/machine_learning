^ it looks like sunday suits us both better , so shall we go for sunday ? 
^ let me know how you want to do it timings-wise eg. whether you 'll be going to &name &name 's or &name &name and whether lunch will be at &name 's. 
^ thank you . 
^ if you could also order me a new computer before midnight on wednesday ( tomorrow ) , then i 'd be grateful . 
^ if you go to the dell website and go through the links to &name & &name office , select any computer and choose " customise and buy " . 
^ you can then choose &name your &name in the left column . 
^ the basket no. is &num and memorable word is &name . 
^ i make the total cost &pound; &num , &num all inclusive - you can check it against the attached &name file . 
^ if &name still wants my existing computer , she is welcome to it for free , but may want another monitor as mine is a little temperamental in whether it displays the red colour channel which can be really annoying . 
^ if that is the case , you may wish to edit the above system before you go to purchase it ( through &name ) and add a monitor under the 'second monitor " section . 
^ &name may also want to consider selling his modem ( which i 'm currently borrowing ) to &name ( i suggest about &pound; &num ) . 
^ if he does n't want to , we can get one fairly cheaply ( in fact i 'd probably sell &name the software one that comes with the dell and buy a hardware &num for myself ) . 
^ see you next weekend 
^ lots of love &name
