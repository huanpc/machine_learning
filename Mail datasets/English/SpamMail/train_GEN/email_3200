ame (  mail )  ame : mon mar  um ,  um  um :  um :  um  ame etc /  ame to :  ame  ame (  mail ) subject : [ ouihc-alumni ] 84th  ame  ame  ame :  mail ^ hi all , ^ now that the dust has settled a bit , i attach write-ups of the  ame  ame : a press release from the captain ,  ame  ame ; and a good article penned for the old blues by  ame  ame . ^ i begin with my characteristically rambling remarks ... ^ for me it was a truly outstanding game that eclipsed the  um  um loss as my nominee for the best game in the past  um years , big hits and pretty plays throughout ... i also believe it was the first overtime victory in  ame  ame history . ^ the usual  ame mindgames / poor organisation of recent years marred the start of the match . ^ the  ame  ame skated out with the rink lights all on to the  ame wars " empire death march music ( or whatever it is called ) instead of the music we had selected to skate out to . ^ the  ame  ame came out to a darkened rink and light show , etc , etc. the referee did n't turn up so the  um linesmen had to fill in. the  ame failed to produce an official gamesheet , so the back of a poster was used with our roster print-out . ^ the start , as  ame says , was not great as players panicked with the  ame and the break-out and defensive system collapsed . ^ visions of previous years " disappointments were hard to dispel . ^ however ,  ame read them the riot act ( it was the worst period of hockey we had played all season , so  um was relatively encouraging ) between periods and the team assumed its proper form in the second ... ^ a few interesting notes to add , which may spice the enjoyment of the write-ups below . ^ channel  um ( national ) television was there and filmed the whole game , as they did  um years ago for the  um loss . ^ this time around , we declined the pre-game interviews in the dressing room as that kind of came back to haunt us in  um . ^  ame  ame , rookie defenceman who has worn an a this term , wore a microphone for most of the second period -- an " interesting " encounter between him and the  ame captain following the latter 's crashing the net was poorly censored on the  um mins of tape that was shown between periods of live  ame coverage last night ... several players have taped it and i will try and arrange for a screening at  ame this year , when i come back . ^  ame , one of our top players was recovering from a ruptured kidney sustained skiing at christmas ( which caused him to miss  ame ) . ^ as a result , he was limited to only a few shifts , mainly on the power play and occasionally on the third line . ^ he was the one who was pole-axed by  ame in ot , as he broke  ame  um  ame defenders , suffering a flash knockout which left his jaw bruised , his teeth loose , and his senses muddled ( it took him a few minutes to figure out where he was ) . ^ after some recovery time , he was able to contribute another shift or  um , which showed that he was pretty wobbly , so we sat him down for the remainder ... ^ we also lost  ame  ame  ame to a badly sprained ankle before the game even started -- the injury was sustained when his foot slipped off a helmet as he tried to negotiate his way across the hopelessly cramped  ame dressing room . ^ the linesman who disallowed  ame " 1st period goal admitted after the first period that he blew the call , which was of little consolation at the time as you can imagine . ^ it would have been a very different game had it stood , but perhaps not as thrilling ultimately ... ^ there has been all kinds of fall-out from the  ame . ^ i must say i was convinced that the  ame would take the  um tie and take off back to the fens with the  ame cup . ^ i didn;t know that  ame and  ame had agreed a  um minute overtime ( in writing ) . ^ luckily , when the  ame official asked me whether we wanted a tie or ot , i was able to guess the right answer ... persuading the officials was more difficult as  ame rules sanction only a  um minute ot . ^ both teams pushed for and got the  um minutes they had agreed , thankfully ! ^ my historical perspective ( that both blues teams predate  ame and ahve earned a degree of latitude ) ^ a bit about the  ame captain ,  ame . ^ he is a great player who has probably logged about 40mins in each of the past  um  ame and rung up rather too many points ... however grudging respect for his abilities as a player was tainted by the dislike at the gamesmanship he demonstrated last year and again this year . ^ in the first period last year , seldom-penalised  ame  ame was given  um minutes and a game misconduct for a seemingly innocuous hit along the boards that left  ame writhing on the ice in pain . ^ the  um minute penalty was where the rot set in for last year 's loss , and the swiftly-recovered  ame was able to contribute a sizeable tally ... ^ anyway , we could n't help but feel a certain poetic justice in  ame 's apparent come-uppance this time around . ^ that feeling was perhaps enhanced by a subsequent email that he sent to  ame  ame ( who wore the  har on the day --  ame rules prevent a goalie from being a captain or assistant , so  ame had to transfer his responsibilities ) , insisting that he had seen replays of the hit and it was perfectly clean . ^ ( perhaps , if they had succeeded in securing a referee for the game , it may have been different , but the linesman who called it described it as one of the most unnecessarily , violent hits he had seen ... ) it is uncertain how we should respond to this plea , but i think we are unlikely to send the  ame cup back ... ^ what was a less forgiveable , however , was one of those odd coincidences that happen when you studying out here , reported by in the same email . ^ one of our more talkative players ( who shall remain nameless ) was at the air  ame desk a few days after the  ame , bragging about his feats , and complaining about the dirty  ame captain , etc etc. a couple turned around in front of him and indicated that they were  ame 's parents and did n't appreciate what he had to say ... not that it deterred the  ame  ame in question , rather it apparently stoked the flames . ^ still , we could n't shut that player up all season anyway , so it is unlikely that we will be able to start now . ^ oh , and before i forget . ^ after the ceremonial face-off ,  ame dropped by the affable high commissioner ,  ame wished  ame luck , to which the latter responded with a smirk , 'so , it 'll be the same as last year then [ i.e.  ame loss  um ] ? ^ i think so " . ^ it would have sounded good in the  ame  ame dressing room had it been so , but i suspect that he has n't mentioned it to anyone there yet ... ^ and ,  um final note . ^ the disorganisation of the  ame scheduling saw me award the  ame goalie their player of the game trophy , their coach award ours , and the high commissioner award the man of the match trophy . ^ then the compere for the day thanked everyone for coming our and please leave now as we had overstayed the booking . ^ i rather bluntly pointed out that the  ame cup has been " overlooked " , and so we were even later getting off the ice ( only to discover that we had locked the dressing room key into the dressing room , which took another  um minutes , , , ) ^ it was a very sweet victory indeed . ^  ame ^  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame history with overtime  ame ^ 84th ice  ame  ame  ame ^  ame  um ^  ame  um  har / ot ^ the  ame  ame wrote a new chapter in the history of the oldest ice hockey rivalry in the world . ^ their overtime victory last night in  ame ,  ame was the first game to be decided in extra time in a fixture dating back to  um . ^  ame  um at the first intermission ,  ame came out aggressively in the second period , tying the score at  um . ^ a power-play goal late in the same period handed  ame the advantage heading into the final frame of regulation time . ^ just after the midway point of the third period ,  ame tied the game at  um , forcing a ten-minute sudden-death overtime period . ^ having killed off a 5-minute penalty to their captain , the  ame  ame found it impossible to stop opposing centre  ame  ame , whose highlight-reel goal with  um :  um remaining in overtime returned the  ame cup to  ame . ^  ame and  ame man of the match honours were awarded to  ame  ame and  ame  ame respectively . ^  ame  ame was named overall man of the match for his dominating physical play and game-winning goal . ^ remembrances of the  ame  ame --  um the sun shone down from a clear blue sky and skipped along broad street where it beamed off the golden sandstone of the  ame theatre . ^ in the courtyard , graduates recent and ancient queued in amusement park fashion , shuffling back and forth before entering the  ame school where they cast their votes for chancellor . ^ all in all , it was a magical , early spring day in  ame , bright and sunny with a playful nip in the air . ^ in other words , it was the season for the  ame  ame . ^ the weather turned edgier in  ame . ^ the wind blew too much , the sun still shone but the cold in the air was a bit overdone . ^ the last road sign , announcing this way to the crematorium and the ice arena , set the stage . ^ inside , the same dingy , disco infested duck pond as in years past . ^ after a hearty welcome from their fans during warm-ups , the blues were introduced in semi-darkness . ^  ame , the little joys of a  ame in  ame . ^ the first period was fast paced and began without evidence of the usual nervousness on either side . ^ most of the period was in the  ame 's side of the red line with bursts towards the  ame goal . ^ early on , a few weak pucks made to the  ame 's goalie and  ame . ,  ame watt offering him a gentle warm-up . ^ although the  ame were on the attack most of the time , their efforts were well thwarted by the  ame 's defense . ^ half way through the period , however ,  ame broke into goal from the corner , looked to pass to the front and then short-sided the  ame for a goal . ^  um or  um minutes later , the blues answered with a goal of their own only to discover that the play had been deemed dead although a whistle was n't heard by the crowd . ^ the  ame took a penalty on the play but were able to kill it off . ^ with a minute to go in the period , the  ame struck again and the period ended  um for the home team . ^  har hard fought period that could have easily been  um was now  um , a condition that was too familiar for those who 've seen the last few  ame . ^ the second period the game slowly  har hanged shape . ^ the first half , the teams were even , heading up and down the ice in equal measure . ^ about halfway through the period with the  ame fans standing as they would the rest of the game , the blues broke through and scored their first goal to be recorded on the board . ^ the  ame responded with a flurry including a breakaway stuffed by  ame and the blues hung on . ^  um minutes after their first goal the blues grabbed another . ^ by this time , the first line of  ame ,  ame and  ame were dominating the  ame and the other lines were holding their own if not better . ^ the  ame 's defense , reliably shut down the  ame in the neutral zone and left no one , including  ame , with enough ice to gather a head of steam . ^ the blues had played a dump and chase and check game from the beginning and it was taking it 's toll on the  ame who had a slightly shorter bench . ^ the  ame were bending but they refused to break and struck a counter blow on one of their infrequent attacks during a powerplay that saw the period end  um . ^ the intensity of the third period continued where the second period left off . ^ despite controlling the game , the blues were in a tight spot . ^ they played consistently and tied the game with  um minutes left . ^ the last  um minutes was a contest of  ame , the blues holding the zone , the  ame chucking the  ame to neutral ice and the blues stuffing it back in. rarely , did the  ame make it into the  ame 's zone with the  ame in tow , but as was shown earlier , it only takes one shot to lose a game that the blues had by this time deserved to win . ^ the  ame goalie played his position well handling a blizzard of shots , not getting caught out of position , handling the easy  um simply and being there on  um or  um occasions that could easily have been goals . ^ incredibly , the game ended in a tie ,  um . ^  har  um minute overtime period was put on the clock . ^ the teams rested at the bench for about  um minutes and then headed back out onto the dirty ice . ^ in the opening minutes the  ame showed a little more life an  har then the blues began to dominate again . ^ some excellent individual efforts were capping the  ame 's charges looking for the winning goal . ^ on  um effort ,  ame fought through  um defensemen turned to face the goalie and was sent flying by a high stick , a high elbow and  um foot charge from  ame . ^ after medical staff revived  ame ,  ame , the only true scoring threat left on the  ame side , was given a  um minute major and game misconduct . ^ now the  ame were really " on the back foot . " the  ame were trying to hold on for a tie and the blues were looking for the finishing blow . ^ the  ame killed the major but the pressure did n't slack . ^ in the crowd , fans wondered if the recent jinx was to hold on this occasion too . ^  ame dug the  ame out of the corner , dragged himself away from defender , crossed in front of the net where the goalie sprawled and blocked his access . ^ but he held the  ame , kept moving to the other side of the net and patiently stuffed the  ame over and behind the prone goalie . ^ the game was over . ^ the blues had brought the cup home and the pain of the last  um years drained out of the veterans on the team . ^ the team and fans erupted in an orgy of joy in front of a  ame crowd who had been hoping to outlast the inevitable . ^  ame , the  ame goalie from buffalo , ny won their mvp . ^  ame picked up man of the match and  ame  ame accepted the trophy for the  ame  ame . ^  har thrilling victory . ^ many thanks to the team for a tremendous effort and a very entertaining game . ^ with  ame ! ^ mail you can get a bigger mailbox -- choose a size that fits your needs ^ ____________________  ame blues  ame mailing list ______________________ mailto :  mail with subject 'subscribe " to be added mailto :  mail with subject " unsubscribe " to be removed </text_embedded></message_body></message>
