^ &name &name , sorry i have n't mailed you for so long but you would n't believe how much work they keep loading onto us ! 
^ i 'm knackered all the time , and i can never be bothered phoning home , so dad 's not too impressed . 
^ &name . 
^ anyway , i have been emailing him but the reason i have n't sent anything to you is because my address book somehow got wiped on the computer , and this is the first time i 've actually remembered to bring my paper address book with me to the computer room ! 
^ &name ... so how are &name and &name ( and &name , i suppose ) and yourself ? 
^ has a date been set for our next dress fitting ? 
^ ca n't wait , myself . 
^ i think i 'll probably start having nightmares about it , closer to the time . 
^ do n't tell &name though . 
^ she emails me a while ago , but i accidentalyy deleted the message before i got a chance to take a note of her address . 
^ do you have it ? 
^ i 'm not sure where it was she was sending it from , see ? 
^ she must think i 'm really rude ( me ? 
^ ha ! ) not replying for so long . 
^ oh well , you can eplain what happened when you see her , as you 'll probably see her before any of my lot do . 
^ in case you 're wondering , i 'm making this email last as long as possible , , , , oh , hold on i 've got new mail . ... nothing interesting- just more supervision rescheduling . 
^ what was i saying again ? 
^ oh aye , i 'm making this a long email &name i should really be doing my physics supervision work , but the questions are supposed to be really hard this week . 
^ so i 'm putting it off . 
^ probably not the most sensible thing to do but never mind , eh ? 
^ have you heard anything about the door-kicking thing at mid street over the weekend ? 
^ dad was n't sure which flat was involved . 
^ very interesting . 
^ anyway , i supose i 'd better go . 
^ see you at christmas ( if not before ) , 
^ &name
