" ^ - you know scarily precise information about my doings . ^ i am worried ^ - did  ame tell you ? ^ he 's been watching me with something akin to distrust . ^ i feel i am heading for trouble . ^ i 've no idea what he thinks i 've done - perhaps you could illicit some information ? ^ " i got a massive ( literally ! ) hifi system last friday . ^ it cost all of  ound;  um ( reduced from  ound;  um , which i thought was a bit of a bargain ! ) . ^ it is a cool [ here follows description of cool hifi , verifying that it indeed is cool ] " ^ - well , that sounds lovely . ^ i may also be slightly jealous , i have n't decided yet . ^ i 'll let you know . ^ " our family holiday [ is ] at the end of august ( we 've got it sorted now ! ) . " ^ - where are you going ? ^ anywhere exciting ? ^  ame ,  ame ? ^ or are you going to splash out and visit the delta  ame ? ^ " ' i 'm going off to camp in a weeks time , oh dear ! " - i guess you 're off now then ? ^ have fun ! ! " ^ - no , i am not . ^ hence the text message you received this morning ( at least it should have been if you had your mobile with you ! ) informing you that i was in  ame railway station . ^ i 'm going to camp on saturday , and will return the saturday after . ^ i 'm a bit worried , and i am meant to be leading an " enquirer 's group " sort of thing , so would you pray for me please ? ^ " well , i have n't anything planned for the next few weeks - just to do stuff with my sisters and have some fun ! " ^ - i do hope you enjoy yourself , and manage to go coast to coast sometime , it sounds fun . ^ have fun ! ^ "  ame ( a very dodgy collection of molecules ) " ^ - you are not a shape-shifter . ^ or are you ? ^ i wonder that could explain  um or  um curious happenings , and fit in with  ame 's high regard for you i shall need to contact  ame  ame . ^ in the meantime , i must tread warily . ^ i have been spending most of the last week writing my chemistry dissertation . ^ i have now completed a rough draft , which ( thankfully ) my supervisor is " pleasantly surprised " with - i 'm not quite sure how to take that ! ^ anyway , i have also been finishing my stone circle in our garden , and my dad is going to plant a tree in it next week . ^ apart from that , i have been indulging in lazy mornings and late nights . ^ very bad and undisciplined ! ^ well , i certainly had a busy day today ! ^ i got up at  um o' clock and caught a train to  ame at  um :  um . ^ after alighting at  ame station i promptly made my way to the library . ^ there i worked ( toil such as only  ame would understand ) until  um :  um , after which i felt within me prognostics of hunger pangs . ^ henceforth i skipped gaily along to  ame 's restaurant of fine foods ( no , i have n't moved to the delta  ame ) and procured a high quality lunch . ^ late as it was , the time delay only heightened my appreciation of sumptuous chicken pieces delicately fried in the purest olive oil you know ,  ame only have a bad reputation due to the senior management 's most effective scaremongering tactics . ^ if everyone realised how akin to  ame their delectable morsels were the chief executives would have no where to eat out for dinner . ^ i look forward to receiving both a reply and an explanation of your curious molecular structure . ^ oh , and do spill the beans concerning old q. i 'm desperate to find out how deeply involved you are in his plans . ^ your curiously curious friend , ^  ame ^ (  ame are interesting - just trust me on this one . ) </text_normal></message_body></message>
