^ hello friends ! 
^ i realise that i have been rather silent over the last few months , and this , believe it or not , is quite heavily due to my final year workness of university , although work is not the only distraction from writing to you . 
^ exams , projects , urgh ! 
^ at the moment , the exams are rather looming , but only &num weeks until they are finished ! 
^ then my formal education is finished ! 
^ ( how scary . ) 
^ the queen 
^ hm the &name is in &name today , and so security is very intense . 
^ as the &name was going to drive up the &name , which is the main street in &name , there were lots of crowds on either side of the road . 
^ a friend ; &name , and i decided that we would walk down the &name to see what it was like at the other end , and before we knew it , there were huge crowds on either side of us , separated from us by police . 
^ so we walked on , loving every minute of it ! 
^ and because we were walking confidently , the police did n't even challenge us ! 
^ we got all the way to the market place before we were told that we really should n't be in the road , so we turned around and walked all the way back up the police-guarded path through the people . 
^ i think i would do well at being famous ! 
^ there is a tutor named &name at my college who is canadian , and i have become friends with him and particularly his &num year old son over the last term . 
^ anyway , the &name was going for lunch at the &name , and &name and his family were standing at the gate of the castle , with canadian flags and waiting there . 
^ i was behind the barriers like everyone else . 
^ then &name 's wife waved at me and beckoned for me to come and stand with them ! 
^ so i went over , got past the first policemen , and then the last one said that i could n't go if i did n't have a flag . 
^ grrr. that was so unfair . 
^ the &name talked to that family for almost a minute ! 
^ grrr. 
^ my birthday 
^ oh well , enough about the &name . 
^ my 21st birthday was absolutely brilliant ! 
^ i realised just how blessed i was with a great family and wonderful friends , and that was probably a good thing to realise . 
^ for my birthday party i had a canadian pancake and icecream party - if you 've never tried pancakes and icecream together , do ! 
^ it works ! 
^ ( even better with smarties on the top . 
^ my future 
^ i 'm not sure what i 'll be doing next year . 
^ i hope to be staying here in &name to do a phd in &num digital mapping , which would pretty much involve running around the countryside with expensive technology for &num years . 
^ i just need to find the funding for that , as my project suffered a funds cut - ie they took away all the funding ! 
^ oh dear ! 
^ &name , i really had better go and do some more revision ! 
^ this break has been longer than i intended it to be ! 
^ lots of love ,
