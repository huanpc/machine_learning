^ i might cc this email to &name &name ... 
<text_embedded>

^ admittedly , the demonstrator ( his name is &name : how cool is that ? 
^ i was dying to introduce myself as &name ... ) called us freaky . 
^ bastard . 
^ but i do n't think i 'll be going away for those weeks , no , since i still have lectures . 
^ but just sitting in my room on those thursday and friday afternoons will * feel * like a holiday ... &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name short for fabian ?

</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ for army things ? 
^ i think not . 
^ for normal people ? 
^ i think not . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ on second thoughts , go to &name . 
^ that would be nicer . 
</text_embedded>

^ hmmmm. .. you 're turning my opinion on this whole holiday thing ... 
^ but take me with you . 
^ and feed me chips and 
<text_embedded> 

^ lard , or just lard . 
^ i do n't mind . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name . 
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name i obviously got that wrong then . 
^ did &name do it ? 
^ &name did do it . 
^ in my defence , i would have done it ( &name it was cool , though &name never works for me ) had i been able to do the questions , but &name i am too dum . 
^ it is a clever persons subject . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ says first &name who did &name systems modelling , advanced graphics , &name &name and all the rest ... ! 
<text_embedded> 

^ but it is . 
</text_embedded>

^ what is what ? 
^ &name is spelt &name ? 
^ my dad thought it was spelt &name . 
^ ( the irish are strange , remember ... ) 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ the &name i knew was called &name and not &name . 
^ but then i did know a &name with a &name 
^ the irish are n't strange , they 're just drunk most of the time . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ surely he would n't be able to read at the 
<text_embedded> 

^ moment anyway . 
^ or is he super intelligent as well ? 
</text_embedded>

^ i 've never met him . 
^ he was only born like a week ago and i have n't been home since then , surprisingly enough . 
<text_embedded> 

^ what about &name &name ? 
^ there must be an alternative . 
^ probably made out of mushrooms . 
^ somehow . 
</text_embedded>

^ there probably is . 
^ ca n't i eat chocolate ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ what about your loyalty to other ( albeit twindling posse of ) vegetarians ? 
^ if you insist on eating artificial protein instead of wholesome meat then you gotta eat artificial lard instead of wholesome lard . 
^ give me the chocolate instead . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name open day before we started . 
^ on reflection , i 'm not sure why that did n't put me off . 
^ oh well ... 
</text_embedded>

^ &name i did n't come to any open days or the like . 
^ bit far for me to come , i 'm afraid . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ brave ( some might say stupid , but not me ) lass 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ get the &name &num instead .

</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ why ever not ? 
^ surely the little dears are the cutest things around ( aside from baby lion cubs) . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name lion cubs are cute , yes . 
^ children ? 
^ hmmmm. .. i suppose they * can * be . 
^ but then why not just get a cuddly toy ? 
^ * they're * cute , and * they * do n't scream and spill and poke and puke and everything else so intensely irritating that kids do ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ there 's slightly less interaction with a cuddly toy . 
^ but then they do cost a lot less as well . 
^ you may be onto something ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ and 
<text_embedded> 

^ they 're funny too . 
^ i got a &pound; &num tip off a girl yesterday , who said as was giving it to me ; " this is for you , because i tried your patience " 
</text_embedded>

^ eh ? 
^ what the hell are you being tipped for ? 
^ &name .is this at the bar as opposed to your computer-y crap ? 
^ i hope you spat in her food . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ and given her rabies ? 
^ i do n't think so ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ they do n't scream and shout too much . 
^ do they ? 
</text_embedded>

^ they can , therefore * sometimes * they do , therefore they do it too much . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ philistine 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ can i call you &name ? 
^ of course , though there is a " bag of chips with extra lard " tax to be levied on every instance of " &name " or " miss &name " 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ &name ha ... i had n't thought of &name &name . 
^ i suppose you do have duck-like qualities ... maybe it was a subconscious choice of name ...
