^ you are a lucky man &name ! 
^ let me suggest that when a woman says no , what she actually means is yes ! 
^ if she says " oh no , i do n't want flowers " , what she actually means is " i 'd love flowers " ! 
^ if she says , " oh , do n't take me out for dinner " what she actually means is " i really want you to take me out for dinner ! " , and if she says " let 's not celebrate &name 's day this year , " what she actually means is " please surprise me with a &name celebration ! " .

^ yes , i spoke to her the other day , and she sounded ok . 
^ in regards to &name , if you want to contact him , i would email him if i was you , rather than calling him . 
^ he 's not being particularly open about the whole situation at the moment , so i 'm not sure what kind of response you 'll get . 
^ ok , well i 'm in the lab doing some language work , so i 'll get back to it . 
^ &name &name ! 
^ &name
