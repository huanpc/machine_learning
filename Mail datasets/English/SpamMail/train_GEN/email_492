^ &name , i have not &name 's phone number , and i think maybe we should just cut our losses on this one ; we have plenty of stuff we can do to them later . 
^ if we just admit defeat then &name has to show you where the things is and it 's gone . 
^ it 's not that big a thing really , is it ? 
^ and i am so tired atthe moment ; i should be expending my energy on my revision and nothing else ! 
^ just let them gloat if they want to- we all have to lose sometime . 
^ if &name wants to think he 's got the better of you , let him ; after all , he 'll regret it later in the term anyway ... it might even be a nice device to make him let down his guard a little . 
^ do n't get frustrated ... do n't let him see that he 's made you mad ; just smile sweetly and agree that he 's got the better of us ... and i think he really has- we 're not going to find this without his help anyway . 
^ this is too minor to go into great long investigations over ; we 'll get bogged down by it when we should be revising . 
^ hope your day 's going ok , i 'll see you later . 
^ is tea about &num ? 
^ love &name
