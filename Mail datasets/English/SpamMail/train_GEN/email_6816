^ ( read this ! 
^ it 's long ! ) 
^ hi everyone , 
^ i think most of us are crying out for a break now and wanting to catch up on sleep ... 
^ i think we all deserve it . 
^ but we also deserve to win the prize too ! 
^ so i 'd like to drop a subtle hint about presentation ... &smiley 
^ i have drafted out a very primitive version of the final presentation ( see attachment ) . 
^ i 'd really like some feedback on it please ... i 'd like to present a draft version to &name &name in the review meeting , which is tmr ! ! 
^ another major part of the presentation is the writing up of our technical paper . 
^ we have done fantastic work , but nobody outside &name really knows about it . 
^ we need to shout about it , unashamedly . 
^ instead of &num person writing it all , the best way to go about it is for everyone to mainly write about what they 've done . 
^ because you are an expert in what you 've done and why you 've done it that way . 
^ everyone would be best at describing and boasting about their own little bits . 
^ this way , we are less likely to make technical mistakes or miss out crucial points . 
^ everyone should be involved in producing this because it is our project . 
^ i have drafted a structure of the paper , the paper will be handed out on the day of the presentation to all faculty memebers , so it has to be engaging to read and impressive . 
^ i have attached a framework of the paper , whom i think should write about the individual section and some suggestions as to what need to be discussed in the various sections . 
^ do n't worry too much about writing in perfect english ... what i need is contents and details . 
^ the paper obviously need to be later proofread , amended , added flair and the overall tone needs to be set and unified ... but you do n't have to worry about those details . 
^ i 'd like this done and submitted by sunday please . 
^ please treat this deadline seriously , because we are serious about our presentation . 
^ so far we 've given &num to the project , we 've come so far , let 's end it in style too ! 
^ i know everyone 's tired and have piled a mountain of sup work , but just push it a little bit more ... &smiley 
^ thanks peeps ! ! !

^ [ slide &num &name general : &name logo , distributed probabilistic factorization of large integers . ] 
^ ladies , gentlemen , members of the faculty and distinguished guests , welcome to &name 
^ &name . 
^ our accomplished mission is a software program that will factorise an arbitrary integer utilising probabilistic algorithms and distributed computing methods . 
^ [ slide &num : flow diagram of the system , including names of the algorithms used , how the system is distributed ] 
^ it is an academically impressive and challenging problem , to achieve our goal we employed some of the most leading edge algorithms and tools . 
^ ( discussion of the various algorithms , how they are optimized in our system . 
^ &num minutes ) 
^ but why ? 
^ you may ask , should it interest you ? 
^ how ? 
^ does it affect your life ? 
^ [ slide &num : applications of factorization in 3freal3f life ] 
^ well , we all expect our bank details , telephone connections and online transactions to be secure and confidential , but most of us take for granted the fact that primality factorization plays an irreplaceable role in many of the underlying security procedures . 
^ you may all be aware that the factorization of large numbers is a very difficult problem . 
^ ( some illustrations required here , eg. it takes typically bla amount of time to factorise a number of bla length ) modern cryptography and security systems exploit the fact that large integers cannot be easily factorised . 
^ on a national scale , security systems based on primality factorization are extensively used by governments . 
^ for example , the &name government has been using &num such system -- the &name &name technology to protect its most sensitive information for nearly &num years . 
^ [ slide &num : how our project may be used in a practical sense ] 
^ ( discussion of how our project maybe used in a topical context &num min ) 
^ admittedly , our project is a somewhat primitive realization of this ambitious plan . 
^ the factorisation is only optimised for integers up to &num hundred decimal digits. ( other constraints , eg on the distribution front and tools available to us ) 
^ however given the time limit of just &num week , we are proud of our achievements . 
^ our accomplishment is driven by a genuine interest in the subject , a strong desire to succeed and a well managed and united work force . 
^ the impending war on &name , the increasingly sophisticated nature of global terrorist organizations are no doubt haunting issues at the back of everybody3fs mind . 
^ whilst we leave strategic decisions in the hands of our political leaders , as scientists , we can make significant contributions to the underlying operations that govern all decision makings . 
^ ( invite audience to join &name &name by downloading our client package ! ) 
^ as scientists , war and peace is very much part of our responsibility . 
^ as scientists , war and peace is our prime concern . 
^ thank you .
