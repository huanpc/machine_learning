^ &name &name , 
^ here 's a massive list of books from some of your courses . 
^ do n't worry : you do n't need them all , but i didn;t look at the &website didnt think there was any point just giving me the preferred texts since my library mihgt ( tut tut spelling ) not have them which was true . 
^ i 'll try and put them in order of preference for each course , so if you find one if the top &num from a list , just do n't bother with the rest ... except where i 've put asterisks which means i would n't mind having all the books with asterisks ... and if you get to the end of the list and you 've already found too many books , then i 'm not really bothered about numerical analysis , &name or comparative programming languages . 
^ too late . 
^ oh , and i 'll also have a few books you can try to find for continuous maths , but &name still has my notes so i 'll try and send that as soon as i find out what the books are ... cheers . 
^ &name send those back on another e-mail .
