^ hi &name ! 
^ thanks for the update - we sure appreciate it . 
^ &name to hear how things have worked out for you , that 's what we have been praying for ! 
^ &name has just started and i have not seen &name yet but i 'm sure i 'll run into her . 
^ &num weeks ago i was clearing out my mailbox at &name &name 's and found the card you had written us in june . 
^ you should have seen everyone 's face around the dinner table as i read them your note to each . 
^ &name asked for a repeat performance of hers after we were finished ! 
^ sorry not to have received the card earlier and acknowledged it . 
^ i feel badly about that . 
^ it made our day ! 
^ please keep in touch and let me know your new email at university if you get one . 
^ blessings ,

^ &name all ! 
^ now that i know for sure what i am going to be doing over the next year , i thought it would be good of me to actually tell you . 
^ i know i 've told some people , but ca n't really remember who , as these last few weeks have been quite crazy . 
^ i am doing a masters course at &name university in &name in geographical information management , which is basically mapping with computers and satellites , so it is pretty good fun , or should be when lectures start on monday . 
^ it is a &num year course , and quite intensive , but very applied , so that suits me just fine . 
^ the people on the course sound really nice , and there is &num christian who i have already identified . 
^ so that is good . 
^ the lecture schedule sounds very crazy with long days , but the material looks very interesting , so that is ok . 
^ i at this time , do not have accommodation sorted out , and so am commuting in to &name ~ ( about an hour away ) . 
^ i have found another girl who is doing the same from &name , and so will probably car-pool with her untill some accommodation can be sorted out . 
^ amazingly enough &name provided the funds ( about &pound; &num ) for me to be able to afford this course , which otherwise , i could n't have done . 
^ i have full funding from the university , which , according to the finance lady who processed my form today , is practically unheard of ! 
^ &name old &name ! 
^ am i incredibly blessed or what ? ! 
^ and this after only applying &num or &num weeks ago ! 
^ the only bad side of this course is being so far away from &name , and more specifically , &name . 
^ i do n't like being so far from her , but i guess this will be good for us - i do n't know why , but everyone says that it will . 
^ &name ! 
^ perhaps they are just being nice . 
^ well , i 'll go now , but i am thinking of you all lots , 
^ &name
