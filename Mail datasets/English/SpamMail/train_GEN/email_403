^ hi &name , 
^ it was very interesting to observe the psychology of group interactions in marshallbees on sunday evening . 
^ thanks for providing the opportunity . 
^ here is a brief summary of our chat 
^ &num ) we all talked . 
^ &num ) you insulted me . 
^ &num ) i insulted you . 
^ &num ) i talked to &name in our own language ( i.e. och , it sure is dreight the nicht ) . 
^ &num ) you talked to &name in your own language . 
^ &num ) an unknown and uninvited guest turned up , calling himself " &name . 
^ &num ) he was very nasty and called us names , like " elitists and " clicky . 
^ &smiley you corrected his spelling of " cliquey . 
^ &num ) you told him you were delighted to be an elitist if it meant you could spell correctly . 
^ &num ) we all told him to go away and learn to spell and construct grammatically correct sentences . 
^ &num ) &name was quite rude towards him . 
^ this was amusing , and may prove to be even more so if it turns out we knew the unknown guy . 
^ so , are you still well ? 
^ are you still watching " diagnosis murder " every day ? 
^ i watched it today . 
^ i also watched it yesterday . 
^ however , i did n't get up at &num : 15am , tempting though it inevitably was . 
^ today i synthesised penicillin ( on paper ) whilst yesterday i synthesised &name and &name ( on paper ) . 
^ talking of cocaine and opium it could be quite interesting next term if some of our flat-mates came home to find a " cocaine-laboratory set up in our kitchen . 
^ i can just imagine the scene 
^ over the next few weeks subtle hints are dropped that &name is not quite the na 've chemist he makes out to be . 
^ &num morning when &name is checking the post she finds a parcel for &name from , say , &name . 
^ this is curious . 
^ she leaves it in his room and probably thinks nothing more of it , but perhaps she does later that day she returns from her lecture to find the kitchen work-surfaces covered with complex-looking chemical apparatus containing curious tar-like substances that bubble . 
^ there are some shallow glass dishes containing a white powdery substance , just recrystalising from solution . 
^ the parcel is lying on the table , opened , and a lab-coat is strewn carelessly on the floor . 
^ the phone suddenly rings she picks it up to hear a curiously thick voice with a sinister-sounding message for &name . 
^ i do n't know what could happen next , but it may well be very amusing ( ! ) 
^ anyway 
^ " i am not going to plot to kill you . 
^ why would i make it that easy for you ? 
^ i 'm going to do something akin to chinese water torture heh , heh , heh 
^ - okay now i 'm worried . 
^ what is chinese water torture ? 
^ i hope you have a lovely christmas &name and a most enjoyable birthday . 
^ i look forward to receiving a reply , 
^ &name
