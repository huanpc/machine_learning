^ hi &name ! 
^ just thought i 'd drop you a line to say hi as i have n't seen you about over the past couple of days . 
^ i 'm not sure what happened at the freshers " fair - &num moment you were behind me filling in a form or something and the next moment i turned round i could n't see you anywhere . 
^ i hope you had a more productive visit than i did ; the sheer number of people and the slow speed they insist on going at got me quite frustrated ! 
^ i ended up signing up for a few things with &name : wine tasting , italian lessons , karate ( ! ) ... only time will tell if anything comes of it ! 
^ anyway , i hope to see you around sometime ; perhaps we can all meet up in the bar &num evening ? 
^ see you soon &name &char
