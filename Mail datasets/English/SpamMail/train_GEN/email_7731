^ dear all , 
^ i have prepared , with consultation with yourselves and welfare members of the &name executive a survey of college welfare provision and services . 
^ i would really like it if all welfare officers could fill the survey in in &website i.e. &website and send it back to me . 
^ if you would prefer a paper copy and ca n't print one up , then email me and i will put one in the post for you . 
^ please bear with me , as the survey is a bit long . 
^ it is worth filling in , i promise . 
^ i plan to collate all the results and write a brief report of my findings , to circulate to all of you . 
^ then , more importantly , i will produce the results as a " database " so that you all will have access to each others results ( although no one else will have access ) and you can see examples of best practice , or just some more ideas about how to improve your college welfare . 
^ the questions are designed to be slightly open ended , so please feel free to elaborate on any of your answers . 
^ any questions , please do get in touch , and thanks in advance for filling in the survey , i hope you will find the results useful . 
^ yours ,
