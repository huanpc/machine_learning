^ i have installed &name a couple of days ago , and have been delighted at the results of my first experiments done with it . 
^ &website ( or the directory in which it has been installed ) does not reveal the presence of the virus . 
^ as of the time of this writing , &name 's virus encyclopedia has no additional information about this virus ( aside from saying that their latest virus definition file will detect it ) . 
^ i would very much appreciate a response from you , as i would very much like to use &name in the near future ! 
^ thank you for your prompt attention ! 
^ &email &name search , le moteur de recherche qui pense comme vous !
