^ &name , 
^ oh my , i 'd like your version of the story much better than mine ... if &num paintings was all there were ! 
^ however , i have yet to do the last &num , which tie all the elements together . 
^ so , picture if you can # &num - the rock is now lying on yet another beach , &num very strange feet and a hand positioned over the rock such that they mirror " young &name &name " in # &num , and # &num , a wide shot revealing that yet another " child " has found the &name &name on a different planet in another galaxy a billion years later . ... 
^ you got something of the concept even without the last bit , though . 
^ cool &smiley 
^ sorry about your being so far from &name . 
^ had a glimpse of her in one of the photos your dad brought . 
^ very nice . 
^ &name well , guess you 'll find out if there 's any truth to the saying " absence makes the heart grow fonder " . 
^ will pass on the rest as it arrives ... 
^ your 'spacey " friend ,
