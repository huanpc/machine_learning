" i 'm sure i 'm a much worse friend than you are . ^ i ca n't wait to live back in college , it makes life so much easier . ^  ame , i 'm so lazy ... ^ oh well , i must get on with some more reading - i 'm going home on saturday , for a week and a half and then back to  ame and on to  ame . ^ i 'm absolutely livid that it effectively takes out a week and a half out of the  um weeks we have left before our exams ! ^ but now it 's not compulsory for me (  ame ! ) i might actually enjoy it ! ^ might see you in  ame in the holiday if you happen to be wandering around , remember to relax mentally as well as not doing any work ! ^ love and plagioclase , ^  ame . </text_normal><text_embedded> ^  ame  ame wrote : ^ dear  ame , ^ how are things going for you this holiday ? ^ i 'm back into the swing of things here in  ame , although i have yet to start any serious revision . ^ this is not good , but i fell that i needed a bit of a rest after this last , very hectic , and enjoyable last term . ^ i do n't feel rested , but i have had a break from work for a while , and so i guess that that counts . ^ one of the things i 've liked least about these last  um terms is how little i 've seen everyone else . ^ with us all working so much harder now , ( i think it would be safe to say that  ame and i are working stupid amounts - he even took a break from the  ame  ame to work ! ^ freak ! ) and that combined now with  ame , means that i get out and see my other friends not nearly often enough . ^ that is something that i shall have to try and do next term . ^ i 'm sorry if i have n't been a great friend . ^ i hope this holiday is relaxing for you and that you can get refreshed for the  ame exams that are coming up . ... ^ lots of love , ^  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
