^ hi all , 
^ remember recreational tomorrow &num and practice &num . 
^ it 's quite good to get there early since we warm up a bit and get to wake up before the practice . 
^ also , the more girls we are , the nicer it is to take part in the recreational , since we get the guys to play * with * us and not despite us . 
^ so : come come come ! 
^ ( subliminal induction that lacks a bit of subtlety ) . 
^ to increase our motivation further : we are playing against &name college on sunday at &num ( sorry &name , i said the wrong hour before ) and it is very important that we play together more and that we get to work better as a team . 
^ now , the &name &name affaire . 
^ the date that was carved in stone a few days ago for our gathering was next wednesday . 
^ i think the lists are up by now . 
^ i 'll randomly pick &num names from the guest list : &name and &name , so that we keep some record of who 's been signed in , and put our names down today . 
^ ( &char & &char , please let me know if you want the vegetarian meal or do n't want wine with the dinner before lunchtime today ! 
^ my default action will be to put you as debauched carnivores ;- ) , though we probably can change that ) . 
^ that 's it . 
^ see you tomorrow in court or today in disguise , 
^ &name
