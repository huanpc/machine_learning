^ hi &name , just realised i have n't asked you for any tickets yet ! 
^ please could you get me one of them ( nus)- &char only have &num people definately wanting to buy them at the &name but if &char actually have them on me , i think it 'll be easier to sell them &smiley how you want to get them to me is up to you ... i wo n't be at ht in the morning this week , but i will be in the evening ... &char may be at flt tomorrow ... i 'll definately be at the prayer meeting , so if you 're coming to that you could give them to me there ... or just go with the standard method if that 's easier &smiley thanks !
