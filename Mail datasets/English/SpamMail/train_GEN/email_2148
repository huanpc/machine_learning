^ - as i said , i 'll see what can be done . ^ let me know any more details though ! ^ well , as you know , on tuesday i managed to clean most of the flat . . . . ... and also cleaned my room with the utmost thoroughness . ^ - oh yes . ^  ame the murderous bacteria-slayer struck again ! ! ^ i had to rush frantically to the railway station . ^ i arrived on the platform , much out of breath ^ - what , you ? ^ that would have been an interesting sight . ^ calm and composed  ame out of breath ? ! ^ to see the train pulling out of the station . ^ my heart sank ^ - all the way to your cats ? ? ^ thankfully it was not my train , which had been delayed by the ineptitude of  ame by  um minutes . ^ - consider yourself fortunate not to have to travel by virgin . ^ they 're even worse . ^ my train was then delayed by vandalising children on the railway track . ^ - tut tut . ^ the  ame kids ? ^ ( they 've all been reunited ! ^  ame says so ) ^ were you around when  ame 's ear was cut ? ^ - no. i just saw the aftermath ! ^ anyway , are you well ? ^ how is your statistics project going ? ^ still coughing , but slowly ( i 'm being positive here ) improving . ^ as to statistics . ... do n't even go there ! ^  um days ago i was in the middle of a power cut . ^ - how exciting , but i think we 've been through most of this before . ^ i do seem to rememebr something about you never getting power cuts in the country side ( despite that being the reason you moved there ) , so i can only imagine that the event brought much warmth to your heart . ^ at  um :  ame i was gaily about to check my e-mail , when the computer switched off and i was plunged into darkness . ^ - now , that is interesting . ^  ame 's  ame embarks upon some deep psychological adventure and your goes into a huff and blanks out on you . ^ oh dear . ^ only goes to show ,  ame are more trouble than they 're worth . ^ my wonderful  ame would n't dream of going wobbly on me ( i think , actually , it would be too scared to ! ) ^ also , if you want  ame  ame  ame service , it can be downloaded from . . ... ^ - well ,  ame  ame . ^ it 's all very well for you people who have free internet access , but we do n't. ^ also , as i explained in my other email , my connection cable is in  ame so  um cannot use my machine for email . ^ as a consequence , i am constrained to use this computer only when my dad is out - which is pretty rare at present as he is busy producing a christian manifesto ( " a vision for our nation " : very grand ! ) for the elections . ^ he 's not standing for anything , it 's just meant to be as a guide for christians to help them choose the right party to vote for . ^  ame , probably makes no sense , but that 's beyond the point . ^ back to the point . ^ as i can rarely get on this machine , i see little point in  ame  ame for me . ^ also , my dad probably would n't let me download it onto his machine . ^ he 's very protective of it . ^ if you want to chat , phone me ! ^ that 's maybe not so exciting or novel ! ! ^ anyway , it is extremely cold here . ^ i woke up this morning and the temperature was only  um degrees  ame . ^ it feels like i 'm back in january ! ^ - you 're definitely becoming a southerner  ame . ^ feeling the cold of your homeland . ^ oh dear . ^ letting the good old hardy scots down there lad ! ^ however , i will agree with you , that if it 's anything like  ame , it 's been freezing ! ^ today , however , is a different story . ^ spring seems to have arrived , and i hopwe this time it decides to stay ! ^  ame please could you send  ame (  ame 's computer ) a get well card , as she 's a bit under the weather . ^ - absolutely not ! ^ never heard so much nonsense in all of my life ! ! ^ kinda funny though ! ^ " eat one live tree frog first thing in the morning | and nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of the day " ^ -  ame , what exactly are you on ? ^  ame , are you going to be in  ame any time towards the end of next week ? ^ if you are , then perhaps we could meet up . ^ let me know . ^ - very possibly . ^ i have to  ame and get this  ame done before i go to  ame as otherwise it will be doing my head in all holiday ! ^ today i had my hair cut ^ - by your mummy ? ! ^ any ear-chopping there ? ^ and i 've spent most of the afternoon painting the bathroom . ^ -  ame  ame strikes again ! ^ you 're always doing doors or painting at home ! ^ i look forward to receiving an e-mail from you when you can . ^ - well , here it is . ^ i managed to get on the computer last night actually , but the silly connection was busy or something so refused to let me connect . ^  ame . ^ more naughty computer antics , although to be fair , this was  ame 's fault . ^  ame what flowers are in your sitting room ? ^ - the  um  um gave  ame ! ^ the  um that had been sitting looking pretty on your flats wimdow-sill for the past  um or so weeks . ^ they were still ok-ish when i left on wed ( they 're dead now ! ) , and as  ame did n't want them , i took them . ^ however , if you are wanting an up-to-date on what flowers are in our sitting room , i can inform you that  ame 's have gone and some lovely white and red carnations have replaced them :  um we gave to my mam for mothers  ame . ^ does that clear up your curiosity ? ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ so , my sister arrived in  ame at  um on sat and i went and met her on the pretence that i was getting my train tickets for travelling down to  ame . ^ we got home and had all the surprise and joy that we 'd intended ! ^ mam was really pleased to see  ame , especially as she was n't feeling very well this weekend . ^ we had a greast time and went out to  ame and walked around the little set of shops there ( fields being no-go areas , shops have to do instead ! ) . ^ yesterday was good . ^ church was lovely . ^ loads of kids came from the local school ( dad is the chair of the governors and a lady called  ame who comes to church is the deputy head there , so they arranged for some kids to come ) and we have a few more people coming now too . ^ there is a lady whoo teaches piano in  ame  ame school who comes ( ! ) - she lives in  ame though , and there is a guy who lives up the street in one of the block sof flats who has been coming for a few months . ^ he came as a result of getting one of the gospels through his door . ^  ame me moaning that we did all those gospels and put them through all those doors and had no response , well , he is coming now . ^ however , he was a christian already , but had been going to a different church where he 'd not really settled in. he is called  ame and used to work with a missionary in  ame  ame for  um yrs ! ! ^ he got back a few years ago and came back to  ame as it was where he was born and lived as a young man . ^ bet it 's really different from what he remembers . ^ anyway , it 's nice to have him coming . ^  ame 's train was at  um this morning as she had to be back in  ame to start work at 10am . ^ oh , nasty . ^ so , i got up at half  um and went with her , mam and dad (  ame was too lazy to get out of bed ) to the station . ^ when i got back i really did n't feel like going to bed so stayed in the sitting room for an hour or so and read some more of my " is  ame true ? " book and am even more convinced that it is not . ^ i think i may send it to  ame and ask him to read it . ^ what do you reckon ? ^ it 's a great piece . ^ tell you what , i could send it to you first instead if you like . ^ dad has supplied me with a whole load of books on the subject . ^ will never be able to read them all , but am going to read the  um he recommends . ^ so , having stayed up to read , i then got really knackered at about  um ( when my sister was getting uo to get read for school ) . ^ so , i went back to bed and only got up at  um . ^ shocking , but it is the holidays ! ^ i plan to do some  ame revision today ( hopefully to give me inspiration for my project ) and also to do some stuff on the computer for my mam . ^ she wants some pictures for her surgery walls . ^ ok , i 'm going now . ^ i 've gone on for far too long ! ^ enjoy ! ^ have fun  ame , bye for now ,  ame ^ ps - what flowers are in your sitting room ? ? ! ! ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
