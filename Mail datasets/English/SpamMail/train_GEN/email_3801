^ i emailed most of you a week or &num ago about my friend &name who was suffering from bad chest pain , well , this is an update and a further request ... 
^ i just spoke to &name online and he is still not at all a happy chappy . 
^ i asked him what was up and he said " cold , flu , tiredness , depression , sore throat , chest infection , skeletal muscular disorder ... etc , etc " ... not a good little list really &smiley 
^ i think he 's going through a bit of a difficult patch 
^ - and i do n't know if he 's really talking to people about it much , so everyone carries on as usual and he is miserable &name he thinks no one cares . 
^ he was hoping to help out with sound at &name survivor and got a place , then the opportunity was taken away because he could n't do the whole thing - which he was indredibly gutted about - and then he had problems because the school lost his &name certificates ... i think just that and lots of little things have got him really down . 
^ so further prayer would be much appreciated ... 
^ he is really not himself at the moment , and i think maybe that 's getting to him most of all . 
^ apologies to everyone for not being a better correspondant - i am trying to catch up slowly but surely ... 
^ thanks guys . 
^ lots of love , 
^ &name xx
