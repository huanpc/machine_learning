^ unfortunately there was a disappointing episode of vandalism in the &name &name over the weekend that has just been reported to me . 
^ a rather nice old chair was smashed to pieces , quite wantonly . 
^ unfortunately this raises problems about leaving the &name &name open at all hours . 
^ i am reluctant to stop doing that , because the &name &name is a useful safety valve , but if there is further vandalism when the &name is relatively empty we will have to think hard about it . 
^ do you have any information on this ? 
^ please remember that such acts are completely unacceptable , and any repetition may put our &name privileges in jeopardy . 
^ &name ( &email ) &name &name &name president &name &name college &name &name &name
