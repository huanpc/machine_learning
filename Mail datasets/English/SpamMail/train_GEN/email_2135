" ^ - what on earth are you talking about ? ! ? ^ - myself . ^ it 's another of those favoured expressions in our family . ^ i think i got a hold of it from my grandad . ^ so , how do you like your new camera ? ! ^ have you taken pictures yet ? ^ i <text_embedded> ^ look forward to seeing it on return to  ame . ^ - my camera is  ame ! ! ^ i 've taken quite a lot of pictures , but have no idea how they 'll come out . ^ i 'm still not all that clued up on this 'shutter-speed " ans " aperture " malarky . ^ when i took photos with  ame 's camera , he was always there to tell me what to do and help me : i 'm a bit flummoxed at times , but i 'm trying to learn how to use it properly myself . </text_embedded>^ well , this is how my day went : i got up at 9am and looked out of the window to see snow ! ! ! ^ ( double-triple-back-flip-handstand and joyous shout of exultant delight ! ) yes , i had a white christmas . ^ - now  ame , i 'm going to tell you a profound truth . ^ that rates much higher on the jealousy scale . ^ i would have loved a white christmas and to be able to sledge and make snowmen . ^ as it was we just froze . ^ however , we did wake up on boxing day to  ame : but it all melted by 11am . ^ anyway , christmas day was great . ^ we opened our stockings at 8am , then went to church at 10am . ^ then came home and me and  ame did the dinner ( yumyum ! ) . ^ then we all ate the dinner ( even yummier ! ) before opening our pressies . ^ other than the camera and it 's case , i did n't get much - but i do n't mind a bit . ^ oh , i got some  ame tokens which i 'll probably use to get more stuff for making cards , or use to buy some camera films . ^ in the evening we watched " chicken run " - great stuff . ^ yesterday , as it was  ame  ame 's day as well as  ame  ame , we had a church service - as our church is called  ame  ame 's. ^ i 'm not convinced by this whole special saints day malarky , but we have a service on  ame  ame 's day every year , so i went along as i always have done . ^ we had a great time in our house afterwards when some people from church came back for tea and coffee . ^ i took loads of pictures of them and we chatted for ages , which was really nice . ^ then in the afternoon we went to  ame hall for a walk . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ today i 've been sale shopping . ^ enough said . ^ did n't get anything . ^ tomorrow we are going down to  ame to stay until sat . ^ the funeral is on friday . ^ well , i must dash as  ame is yelling for me to come to tea . ^ have fun pal , from  ame . ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
