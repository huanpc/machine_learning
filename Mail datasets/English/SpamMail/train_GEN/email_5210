? ? ? ^ breast cancer is linked to estrogen . ^ what mimics estrogen in the female body , soya ! ^ but i never suspected soya because until now i never once found a single article that stated soya could be dangerous . ^ women who took soya prior to thyroid problems will continue to take it after if they are not aware of what soya actually does , what it contains and how it reacts in the female body . ^ i think this is the reason that women with thyroid cancer often develop breast cancer later . ^ my co-worker is big into soya and i see her losing hair and gaining weight despite a walking workout during her break and after work , and apples and oranges for lunch . ^ she just had cysts removed from her uterus too . ^ i warned her to stay off soya . ^ i refered her to websites but until it is on the evening news on all  um networks , women will suffer . ^ since the thyroidectomy . ^ i do not touch soya , have n't for  um years . ^ dear readers , please use my story in any way you can . ^ there are so many young girls who are consuming soya because they think they are taking care of themselves , and women taking soya because they want to be healthy . ^ it is so unfair that the information about the dangers of soya is n't more widely circulated . ^ it is sad . ^ there are many out there who feel this way and it is a terrible blow when you realize you are not as healthy as you thought and that the information that you depended on was wrong . ^ some references ^  ebsite ^  ebsite ^  ebsite </text_embedded></message_body></message>
