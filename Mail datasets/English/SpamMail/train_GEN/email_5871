^ hi , maybe you 'd like to have a look at this before the meeting -- some points we should go over tomorrow . 
^ you may also have received an email from &name &name saying we ca n't have the slot at 4pm on friday 31st . 
^ i think it 's still too early to book for a slot -- &name is not yet taking bookings that 's why she suggested contacting &name directly . 
^ we will get back to &name again soon .
