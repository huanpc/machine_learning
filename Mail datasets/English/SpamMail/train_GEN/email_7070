^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your email , and interest . 
^ the best thing to do is to book a time in for the first session , and take it from there ( if we go ahead with the main study ) . 
^ i normally test between &num & &num monday - friday with occasional exceptions . 
^ would you be able to do the first session next tuesday , wednesday or thursday within these times ? 
^ it takes about &num hour at the most . 
^ if you can suggest a couple of times within these hours then i should be able to confirm it ! 
^ look forward to hearing from you , 
^ thanks ,

^ thanks for your e-mail . 
^ i 'd certainly be interested in helping , but the difficulty will be trying to find some mutually acceptable time over the next week . 
^ should we be able to find some time , then i 'd be more than happy to help . 
^ let me know the sorts of times that are available and i 'll see what i can make of them .

^ dear &name , 
^ i am writing to see if you would like to take part in a study that i am running at the cognition and brain sciences unit in &name . 
^ the study involves coming in for &num 30min-1hr sessions - twice a week for &num weeks ( or &num sessions within a &num day period ) is best . 
^ the tasks involved are : 
^ - reading text on a computer 
^ - filling in missing words on a computer 
^ - answering comprehension questions about the text and 
^ - answering some personality questionnaires 
^ we will pay a lump some of money at the end of the last session , which will be the sum of the time you 've spent here each time , plus travel , which should equate to around &pound; &num in total . 
^ participation in this experiment is dependant on a certain factor which cannot be determined until the first session ( determined by questionnaire ) , so we also have an alternative task set up if we decide not to go ahead with the above experiment . 
^ this is a one-session experiment . 
^ in this case you will just be paid for that session , plus travel . 
^ i am looking to begin testing straight away , but the study will be ongoing for the next month or so , so if your not available straight away , you can still contact me . 
^ if you would like to take part in the study or want further details , please contact me by email , or phone ( below ) . 
^ many thanks , 
^ &name &name .
