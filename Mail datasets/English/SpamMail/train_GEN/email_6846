^ hi &name , glad to hear you 're ok now- or at least " a bit better on track " &smiley was great to see posters up in the &name today ! 
^ i 'm afraid tomorrow 's really no good for me- i 'm rather snowed under at the moment and do n't have many gaps in my day tomorrow anyway ... i might not be able to do much until the weekend ... 
^ as for prayer meetings , i 'm afraid this friday 's out for me- food for thought kind of arranged for after &name and next friday i 'll be at the rehearsal &smiley i guess i could possibly do thursday before risky living ( after &num ) or friday before &name 's ( hmm ... after 2.30?)- but the weekend would be better- do you think there 's any chance of having it saturday afternoon or even sunday ? 
^ sory , i know i was supposed to look into this- only problem was that i could n't find much free time this week ! 
^ and i 'll chase up the gospel issue too , and see how many they 've got left after witness ... 
^ i think that 's all- thanks for all you 've been doing ! 
^ take care , love &name ps- i saw &name yesterday night ( we , together with &name &char , spent almost &num hours bowing parts ... ! ) and he said the placing of the talks has all been finalised- so hopefully he 'll be able to reply to &name " email about that &smiley also all the fixing 's done apart from &num double bass- &name 's reluctant to get the list to &name before it 's completely finished ... but i do see that we originally decided to have the progs completely finalised by tomorrow . ... 
^ oh- just realised why saturday 's not such a good idea for the prayer meeting- cums ! 
^ but could sunday work ?

^ hi &name , 
^ i 'm going to be brief , because i need to get to bed , but just to say sorry i have n't been in contact properly over the last week . 
^ i 've been somewhat snowed under with work and getting progressively more tired and hence i did n't make evening witness things at all or church on sunday " &name i just needed sleep . 
^ anyway , things seem to be a bit better on track now - i just need to watch the work to ensure i do n't let my group down or let supervision work fall behind . 
^ hope you are feeling better than yesterday morning . 
^ do get plenty of rest and let me know if there is anything i can do . 
^ publicity is all in order ( we 've got a great publicity team ! ) . 
^ i 'm doing &name road area on wednesday afternoon if you are able and want to join me . 
^ programmes are coming on ok , once provisions in my e-mail to &name have been sorted . 
^ &name &name started in &name today without any glitches - once posters go up then we might actually sell some &smiley finances are ok ... see the website for revised budget to accomodate the organ . 
^ could you please chase up the gospel issue ? 
^ i thinks that everythings is generally coming together ! 
^ we need also to sort out a prayer meeting . 
^ my evenings are generally all booked up . 
^ i know this might not be brilliant for you , so feel free to say no , but would it be possible to have one on &name 7th and one on &name 14th after &name 's ( time and venue your choice ) ? 
^ otherwise we 're onto daytime slots . 
^ take care and hopefully see you soon , 
^ love &name

^ hi &name , have n't heard from you for a while , and i do n't know what i can do to help ... had a worried-sounding text from &name this morning , asking if i could find out what 's happening with the programme when i saw you at church today- but i 've only just got that and as you know , i did n't see you at church &name i was n't there &smiley do please let me know if there 's anything i can do- and please could you let &name know what 's happening , he 's &char worried that &name wo n't have enough time to prepare properly .
