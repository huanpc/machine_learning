^ hi &name , 
^ &char couple of questions regarding the first c++ practical : 
^ in the af_player program , the final loop continues while the number of samples written is ) &num . 
^ when the &name method reaches the end of the file , would n't it return &num , denoting that it has n't got any more samples to write ? 
^ if this is the case then the loop in af_player will be non-terminating . 
^ also , can we assume that the audio file contains continuous samples , meaning that the &name method will write framesize samples until reaching the end of the data , or might it contain " holes " , requiring the number of samples written to be calculated from the data itself ? 
^ regards , 
^ &name &name
