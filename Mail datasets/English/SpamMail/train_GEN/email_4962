^ as &name started to say , timestamps are already there , we just have to hide them from the user by editing the queue viewer and workload generator . 
^ strings are already there , the &name just does n't deal with strings with a size ) &num well . 
^ stream id will be an int , not a string , and has to be generated by the workload generator ( for now ) . 
^ besides editing the queue-viewer ( which is easy ) these tasks do n't really fall into a domain that we have been playing around in ( &name and workload generator ) so it is probably best to ask them for a time estimate . 
^ also , either the &name or the fieldext method have to be edited to start all user offsets at &num bits ( &num bytes ) but i am not sure where it is best to hard code this system offset .
