^ you missed some features 
^ - the left and right as rest to resizing policy 'minimum " so the center takes all available space 
</text_embedded>

^ i do n't want the center to take all available space . 
^ in fact , if anything , the third panel should take up more space so as to provide room for content . 
^ there is nothing special about the centre column. . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i disagree ; the amount of different templates per " category " can grow quite 
^ easily . 
^ you do n't want it growing vertically when it can grow horizontally . 
^ remember that a company can easily create &num templates for their styles whi ch have to be viewed correctly .

^ 
^ - the open button should be right aligned ( its a bit too big now ) that 's sort of the point . 
^ it 's in an out-of-the way place , so &char wanted to make sure it is noticeable . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ this just makes me think its positioned wrong ; you are prepared to break standard &name rules to make it look different since ( as you allready found ) &char &char is out of place ... 
^ never a good idea . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - you miss the location label ( for recent files ) 
</text_embedded>

^ that would appear in the third pane in the description area . 
^ &char &name tends to get quite long , and spanning it over &num lines surely does &char ot increas readablility . 
<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - you miss the intro text 
</text_embedded>

^ third pane . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ surely not ; the intro is about the whole dialog . 
^ its an intro on what you a re doing in this dialog and should be a &num liner that does not go away ; that 
^ has no place in a context sensitive panel ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &website 
<text_embedded> 

^ i do n't like the header " categories " . 
^ first it should be clear without that header and second it stops me from looking for recent files there . 
</text_embedded>

^ yes , you 're probably right on that one ... 
<text_embedded> 

^ i think you want a normal list here with icons _above_ the names . 
^ just like the panels that group config dialogs ( the kword config for example ) 
</text_embedded>

^ &char want them beside the words ... this keep the relationship between icon a nd text completely unambiguous , since we have different background colors per row this is not any better ab &name my proposal . 
^ plus that the concept of icon above text is pretty omnipresent 
^ in every &name . 
^ saves vertical space ( allowing larger icons &char / out a vertical scroll bar ) and preserves the left-to-right nature of th is dialog . 
^ see the macos &char finder for examples of this ... 
^ but the horizontal space is always more expensive then the vertical space &char &char a computer screen . 
^ so this does not make any sense . 
^ amazingly enough ; whenever you see a screenshot of konqueror you see the ic ons view . 
^ the icons there are above the text . 
^ as people only make screenshots &char &char things they think are beutiful ( for the purpose of demo-ing anyway &smiley i thi nk you are wrong in your assumptions . 
<text_embedded> 

^ you made the same mistake using the open / open existing file buttons i posed in the email you replied to . 
</text_embedded>

^ the wording of the button in the third frame sucked &num ) i hope i 've impr oved that somewhat ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ thats not the point . 
^ it is about what the button is for relative to the placement of the button . 
^ if i make an outline of the dialog ( only the panel outlines and lines plus 
^ the buttons , and absolutely no text ) people will not expect the usage you want this button to have . 
^ any texts , colors or other goodies are no substitute for correct placement of buttons . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ and just to be a broken record , this should be embedded right in the kword / kspread / kpresenter / etc window and not a stand-alone modal dialo &char . 
</text_embedded>

^ maybe that last point is the real solution ; just show the template chooser in the main window and have a button on top to open an existing file using an external &name . 
^ this steps around a whole lot of problems ... 
</text_embedded>

^ i think so ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name that you get some ideas to finish this . 
^ my &name does not seem able to open kde widgets anymore .. &name ( no -kde optio &char for configure ) .
