^ hi &name , 
^ we here at lake software provide a virtual keyboard designed for the physically disabled , free of charge . 
^ you can check us out at &website many free add-ons and language packs . 
^ because many of our users are relatively unsophisticated with regard to computers , we have to distribute everything in self extracting format , with automatic installation . 
^ &name &name is just what we need . 
^ especially with its choice of language , and wide range of extraction options . 
^ without &name maker we would n't be able to offer click-n-type as freeware . 
^ we thank you very much . 
^ over the past &num weeks or so we 've been getting many complaints , from potential users , about these self extracting files being infected by random viruses . 
^ &name reported one , pc-cillin ( trend ) and a french &name program reported another in a different file , and now a completely different file is being reported as infected by yet a different virus by &name / 9x ( &name from &name ) . 
^ of course all these alarms are false . 
^ the files clear the latest &name and &name , not to mention we 've triple checked our registries . 
^ we contacted ca about inoculateit and they corrected the problem , but would n't give us any clue about what caused it .. the other companies wo n't give us the time of day . 
^ has any &num else had this problem using &name &name ? 
^ do you have any ideas what could be triggering so many false alarms from such a wide variety of " cheap " &name programs ? 
^ we 're getting to be known as the virtual keyboard with a new virus each week . 
^ &smiley 
^ any help would be appreciated . 
^ thanks , &name the lake software folks &website
