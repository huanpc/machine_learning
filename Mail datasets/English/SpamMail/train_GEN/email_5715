^ dear all , 
^ for any rambling club members still in &name tomorrow ( saturday 14th december ) , we are planning a short walk followed by a pub lunch , as a final end-of-term gathering . 
^ we will meet on the quayside next to &name bridge at 11.00am tomorrow , and walk &num miles down the river to &name , following a route similar to that of our " introductory " ramble in october . 
^ the whole walk will be along the &name towpath , which is not too muddy , so boots should n't be necessary . 
^ then we 'll eat lunch at one of the pubs in waterbeach village , before taking the train back to &name mid-afternoon ( arriving &num : &num or 
^ 15: &num ) . 
^ we are buying lunch at the pub ( and eating indoors ! ) , so please do n't bring a packed lunch . 
^ please accept my apologies for the short notice of this announcement . 
^ as usual however , there 's no need to sign up in advance ; we 'll phone the pub en-route to reserve a table , just in case it is full . 
^ wishing you all the best for christmas and the new year , &name &name . 
^ nb the one-way train fare from waterbeach to &name is &num pounds with a railcard .
