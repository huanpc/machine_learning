^ hi &name , 
^ thanks very much for providing that information concerning the telephone bill . 
^ well , how are you ? 
^ i sent you a text message this morning , but you did n't reply . 
^ are you enjoying the summer weather ? 
^ i am - we are living under a thick and chilly sea fog , and have been for the past &num days . 
^ i 've just finished my week in my dad 's bookshop . 
^ it was quite good . 
^ i read some books , listened to music , did some work , sent some text messages , etc. oh , and sold books too ! 
^ next week i 'm painting our sitting room and starting to make a cobbled path . 
^ i 'm also meant to finish off our stone roundabout thingy , but it 's boring ! 
^ i 'm quite happy today ! 
^ tomorrow i shall hopefully go for along cycle ride in the morning and attempt some of my dissertation in the afternoon . 
^ my parents areaway to visit my grandmother for the weekend , so it 's just me and my brother at home . 
^ i got back from &name last sunday evening . 
^ i said goodbye to the flat and handed in the keys ( or rather , my parents did as they were staying in &name 's for a few days and there was no one at reception when i was leaving ) . 
^ the end of a chapter ( and a gloriously enjoyable on at that ) in my life . 
^ that means i get to turn over the page . 
^ i 've never thought of that before ! 
^ so , what are you whiling away your time with ? 
^ have you found any jobs you want to do this summer ? 
^ are your various computers all well ? 
^ have you heard from &name ? 
^ i think it must be time for another mass-update . 
^ definitely , i 'd guess tomorrow . 
^ well , i 'd better go 
^ very best wishes , 
^ &name
