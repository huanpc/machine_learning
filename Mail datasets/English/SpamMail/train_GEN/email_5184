^ ok msgs seem to keep crossing - i assume that what &name did will have solved the immediate problem , but you need to liaise with &name ( &name &name ) who is also routinely using postgres on opus so that you ( pl ) make sure you ( pl ) do n't leave lock files around or otherwise get in eachother 's way . 
^ note the man page for postmaster about &name . 
^ &name to &name - if this is too terse could you talk to &name please ?
