^ i will be sending a letter to welfare officers tomorrow , so please read it , put the dates in your diary and fill in the reply slip ( and return it to me) . 
^ anyway , here are the minutes ! 
^ welfare officer &name 27th november &num

^ &name : &name ( &name ) , &name ( &name ) , &name ( &name ) 
^ &num &name : a lot of people are in the process of handing over of having their elections ( &name , &name , &name , &name , &name , &name . 
^ &name said that because of this , she was planning to hold welfare officer &name &name during next ( &name ) term , it was agreed that saturdays would be the best day , and that offering &num days , that people could choose from would be a good way of maximising turn-out . 
^ &name also reminded people that some disability awareness training had been arranged with &name at the &name for the very start of &name term , tuesday january 14th 3-6pm , she will be sending out a letter at the start of december to remind people of these dates . 
^ attack alarms and personal safety were things &name , &name and &name have been working on . 
^ &name said that welfare officers could buy attack alarms from &name in bulk , and then sell them onto their students . 
^ she also said that because of the interest this term , she was planning to run an awareness campaign about this next term . 
^ this is something that the women 's &name is currently doing , to a certain extent , with the " &name the night " and " street lighting " campaigns . 
^ &name has been putting together a report for &name about their exam stress relief work , she said she will pass it onto &name when completed and taken to college council , so that other welfare officers can use it if they want to . 
^ &name and &name have been doing some stuff for &name aids &name . 
^ &num as a result of what came up in the previous week 's meetings , &name &name &name &name , &name of the university counselling service to talk about " peer supporters " . 
^ &name introduced the &name by saying that it does a certain type of work that can help some people , but that there is a range of support systems in place for students and that often in the front line of students support is their peers . 
^ &name has been running a " peer supporter " scheme for a number of years . 
^ the scheme start when a few colleges approached their counselling service to ask for some extra training for some students , so that they could support their peers and give some level of support that is between counselling and being a welfare officer . 
^ this has since expanded and now nearly every college sends &num students a year to be trained ( &num hours a week for &num weeks ) , the colleges identify the students themselves and pay for each students training . 
^ after completing training , the students are identified within the college ( e.g. notice in p'lodge ) as " peer supporters " , they then get monthly " supervisions " where the group meets again with the &name service to ensure they are supported themselves . 
^ issues that welfare officers highlighted were not wanting to upset a college 's current provision for &name ( e.g. &name have their own college &name ) , and just generally the ability of the college / &name / mcr for finding the money to cover costs of training and supervision . 
^ it would be important to ensure continuity e.g. getting people involved early on in their time at &name . 
^ the formality of the system is something that might scare people off getting involved ( e.g. the time commitment ) , as well as possibly scaring people off seeking " peer supporters " . 
^ there is also the concern with balancing ; training fewer people to a higher level , or training more people on a more general level ( e.g. &num person within friendship groups) . 
^ the scheme could be started on a smaller scale as an extension of a college " parenting scheme' . 
^ it might also be possible to reduce running costs by getting trainers in for free ( although this would work for a " one-off " training session , it is unsure whether trainers would regularly volunteer their time) . 
^ the support system for such " peer supporters " could be more general e.g. the welfare committee in colleges . 
^ training could take place on a weekend ( before the start of term ) rather than consistently throughout term . 
^ it was decided that &name would email the welfare officers and exec with some outline plans for a possible scheme and then a group of interested people , could formulate more defined plans and work on them . 
^ &num &name &name &name &name gave out ribbons and collecting tins / boxes to the welfare officers there , which she had brought from aware . 
^ welfare officers can put these in the bar / p'lodge etc to collect money and sell ribbons to increase awareness . 
^ they can choose which charity they would like to donate the money to , or they could donate to " &name &name / aids &name " and send the money to &name at &name to send onto a aids &name ( probably national aids trust) . 
^ &name reminded everyone about the conference and looks forward to seeing you all there ! ! ! 
^ then lots of chocolate biscuits were consumed .
