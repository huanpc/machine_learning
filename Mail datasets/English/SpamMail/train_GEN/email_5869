^ ( &name , &name said &name had n't given you any work to do for the 2nd supervision - we 've got &num next week , this is what he gave us , presumably in addition to the 1st lot ) 
^ monday at &num is fine , and so is wednesday at &num . 
^ i give you some more work to ponder about . 
^ please hand something in on monday morning before &name .

^ but is it more powerful ? 
^ - the head can never replace symbols ( every cell can be written on only once ) 
^ this machine is ( clearly ?
