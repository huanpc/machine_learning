^ it provides a safe namespace to avoid collisions with other binaries when using common words ( mail , word , node , ppp , print , calc , gpg , etc ) and was something of a tradition . 
^ of course we also have megami , juk , lskat , quanta , umbrello , &name , etc. even then , i do n't see the issue with app names such as kopete . 
^ there is greater creativity occuring with application naming as time goes on ... 
^ and do people really get concerned over the word " &name " ? 
^ or " &name " ? 
^ you said that they are disappointed when &name does n't look / work the exact same was &name &name . 
^ i 'd say that at least they were able to make the connection that it 's a word processor .

^ i 've have people ask me about problems with kswapd in &name channels on &name thinking it was a &name application , but i 've never seen it actually lead to a problem where the user simply could n't figure out what to do or was even half-concerned about it . 
^ and removing the " &char " from those apps that have one in their name would n't help with identity issues , anyways ...
