^ &name &name , 
^ as i mentioned a few hours earlier , and about a hundred miles further southward , the flat account is still open and has our money in it . 
^ i am waiting for our esteemed colleagues , &name and &name to send me a list of which calls they think they have made . 
^ &name , i wait , i wait , i wait . 
^ perhaps you could engage in some subtle hinting ? 
^ anyway , once i receive that information i shall speedily conclude working out the telephone bill and calculate how much we all owe . 
^ following that , i shall draw our final bills ( or cheques , as is more likely - i hope ! ) and send them to you all . 
^ i hope that is to your satisfaction . 
^ what have you been encountering this week in the way of &name , academic work , fun , or anything else remotely interesting ? 
^ thank you for your attempts at solving the username puzzle . 
^ i have not given up yet , but must confess i am currently without leads and pretty much at a loss . 
^ do not fear though , it will be solved before i leave &name ! 
^ ( brave words for a chemist . ) 
^ i have been spending most of the last week writing my chemistry dissertation . 
^ i have now completed a rough draft , which ( thankfully ) my supervisor is " pleasantly surprised " with - i 'm not quite sure how to take that ! 
^ anyway , i have also been finishing my stone circle in our garden , and my dad is going to plant a tree in it next week . 
^ apart from that , i have been indulging in lazy mornings and late nights . 
^ very bad and undisciplined ! 
^ well , i certainly had a busy day today ! 
^ i got up at &num o' clock and caught a train to &name at &num : &num . 
^ after alighting at &name station i promptly made my way to the library . 
^ there i worked ( toil such as only &name would understand ) until &num : &num , after which i felt within me prognostics of hunger pangs . 
^ henceforth i skipped gaily along to &name 's restaurant of fine foods and procured a high quality lunch . 
^ late as it was , the time delay only heightened my appreciation of sumptuous chicken pieces delicately fried in the purest olive oil you know , &name only have a bad reputation due to the senior management 's most effective scaremongering tactics . 
^ if everyone realised how akin to &name their delectable morsels were the chief executives would have no where to eat out for dinner . 
^ very best wishes , 
^ &name
