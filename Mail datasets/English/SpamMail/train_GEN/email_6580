^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : unchecked buffer in profile service could allow code execution in commerce server ( q322273 ) &name : june &num , &num &name : &name commerce server &num , commerce server &num &name : &num vulnerabilities , each of which could run code of attacker 's choice . 
^ &name &name : critical bulletin : ms02-033 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ &name : 
^ commerce server &num and commerce server &num are web server products for building e-commerce sites . 
^ these products provides tools and features that simplify developing and deploying e-commerce solutions , and provide tools that let the site administrator analyze the usage of their e-commerce site . 
^ &num vulnerabilities exist in the commerce server products : 
^ - a vulnerability that results because the profile service contains an unchecked buffer in a section of code that handles certain types of &name calls . 
^ the profile service can be used to enable users to manage their own profile information and to research the status of their order . 
^ an attacker who provided specially malformed data to certain calls exposed by the profile service could cause the commerce server process to fail , or could run code in the localsystem security context . 
^ this vulnerability only affects commerce server &num . 
^ - a buffer overrun vulnerability in the office web components ( &name ) package installer used by commerce server . 
^ an attacker who provided specially malformed data as input to the &name package installer could cause the process to fail , or could run code in the localsystem security context . 
^ this vulnerability only affects commerce server &num . 
^ - a vulnerability in the office web components ( &name ) package installer used by commerce server . 
^ an attacker who invoked the &name package installer in a particular manner could cause commands to be run on the commerce server according to the privileges associated with the attacker 's log on credentials . 
^ this vulnerability only affects commerce server &num . 
^ - a new variant of the &name &name vulnerability discussed in &name &name &name ms02-010 . 
^ this variant affects both commerce server &num and commerce server &num . 
^ mitigating factors : 
^ profile service buffer overrun : 
^ - the affected &name calls in the profile service are not exposed to the &name by default . 
^ the administrator must set up a commerce server site and include profile service calls as part of that site . 
^ - the &name tool , if deployed using the default ruleset for commerce server , would make it difficult if not impossible for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to run code , by significantly limiting the types of data that could be included in a &name . 
^ it would , however , still be possible to conduct denial of service attacks . 
^ - best practices for web site design can prevent this vulnerability from being exposed by limiting user input that can be accepted by input fields . 
^ &name package buffer overrun : 
^ - for an attack to succeed , the attacker would need to have credentials to log on to the commerce server &num computer on which the &name package installer is kept . 
^ - best practices suggests that unprivileged users not be allowed to interactively log onto business-critical servers . 
^ if this recommendation has been followed , unprivileged users would not have access to commerce server machines . 
^ &name package command execution : 
^ - for an attack to succeed , the attacker would need to have credentials to log on to the commerce server &num computer on which the &name package installer is kept . 
^ - best practices suggests that unprivileged users not be allowed to interactively log onto business-critical servers . 
^ if this recommendation has been followed , unprivileged users would not have access to commerce server machines . 
^ new variant of the &name filter buffer overrun : 
^ - although commerce server does rely on &name for its base web services , the &name &name filter is only available as part of commerce server . 
^ customers using &name are at no risk from this vulnerability . 
^ - the &name tool , if deployed using the default ruleset for commerce server , would make it difficult if not impossible for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability to run code , by significantly limiting the types of data that could be included in an &name . 
^ it would , however , still be possible to conduct denial of service attacks . 
^ - an attacker 's ability to extend control from a compromised web server to other machines would depend heavily on the specific configuration of the network . 
^ best practices recommend that the network architecture account for the inherent high-risk that machines in an uncontrolled environment , like the &name , face by minimizing overall exposure though measures like &name 's, operating with minimal services and isolating contact with internal networks . 
^ steps like this can limit overall exposure and impede an attacker 's ability to broaden the scope of a possible compromise . 
^ - while the &name filter is installed by default , it is not loaded on any web site by default . 
^ it must be enabled through the commerce server administration &name in the &name &name &name ( &name ) . 
^ &name &name : 
^ - &name systems : critical 
^ - &name systems : critical 
^ - client systems : none
