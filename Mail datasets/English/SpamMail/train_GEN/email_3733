^ hello all and welcome to a chance of a lifetime ( and no i 'm not advertising porn or debt consolidation like the other &num emails in your inbox ) . 
^ i turn &num on october 25th and i have a question for you all . 
^ who would like to join me in parachuting around that date ? 
^ if you 've always thought about parachuting but never really imagined it happening , let me tell you something , it 's now or never . 
^ when else would you do it anyway ? 
^ the bargain : &num of course would not pay for you but &name ( &name university freefall club ) offers the best deal , one that you would n't find outside university . 
^ there are &num options : 
^ &num ) &name : &num minutes tuition , you are then strapped to an instructor , freefall &num seconds from &num , &num feet , followed by &num minutes descent ( unless the parachute breaks and then it might be quicker ) 
^ &num ) &name &name : &num hours training ( &num or &num evenings ) , then solo jump from &num , &num feet , parachute opens as you jump away from the plane 
^ basically , if it 's a one off , tandem 's the way to go : &pound; &num with no cheap 2nd jumps . 
^ if you want to take it further , &name is the way to go : &pound; &num with any further jumps in the future only &pound; &num ! ! ! ! 
^ working towards solo freefalling after &num jumps . 
^ i 'm keen to do either but want to know which you 'd prefer . 
^ my big question to you ! 
^ is will you rise to the challenge ? 
^ i do n't want to jump alone and this is an excuse to &name and fulfil a destiny ( goran ivanisevic ) , and i invite you to join me . 
^ i fear costs will be a barrier , but let me say this : it wo n't be getting any cheaper we have &num weeks , and we all can cut corners and save enough if we really wanted to do it . 
^ your choice . 
^ let me know yes or no and then we can go along to the freefall club in &name week to sign up . 
^ hope you 're all well . 
^ &name 
^ ps oh , &num thing , do any of you guys feel a barrier to getting in touch with people over the holidays , kind of like either they should be too busy , or you should , or you kind of forget how good friends they are ? 
^ strange really , &name 
^ &name a lot of you are n't &name , but you are still more than welcome , only of course you would have to come up to &name to do the parachuting ( and would be welcome to sleep on my / a friend 's floor ) . 
^ i 'll also make sure it costs you no more to parachute than it does us through &name , bye ! ! 
^ ring me for enquires ! : &num &num anyone i know not on the email list is also welcome , invite them . 
^ get your free download of &name explorer at &website
