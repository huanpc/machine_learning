^ hi all , 
^ as many of you probably know ( hopefully when your virus scanner started beeping ) there 's a nice new virus currently infecting the network - a worm called &email or one of its associated names . 
^ the virus generally comes from " user " or 'single user " but can also use real names as it copies whatever values it finds on the previously infected computer . 
^ what arrives looks a bit like this : 
^ from : [ registered windows user name ] subject : [ registered windows company name ] 
^ message body : product name : [ &name version ] &name &name : [ &name &name ] &name &name : [ &name ] process list : [ list of processes ] 
^ all of the information inside the brackets is taken from the infected computer . 
^ the worm is attached to the email message ( generally in the form " &website " ) and if the email message is viewed on a system without an up to date virus scanner , the worm will run automatically . 
^ [ puts on computer-officer hat ] to quote the network 's terms of use " &name software should be installed and kept up to date " on any computer attached to the network . 
^ so make sure you have it ! 
^ go to &website . 
^ anyway ... 
^ as long as you do n't open the message , you wo n't get your computer infected . 
^ unfortunately , &name and &name &name will attempt to open it for you if you have the preview pane active . 
^ wonderful wonderful &name &smiley 
^ &website in the system folder , edits your registry and will probably make your computer crash amongst other nasty things . 
^ to remove the virus , follow the instructions below , but do n't edit your registry if you do n't know what you 're doing ! 
^ &num &name your antivirus software 's virus definitions . 
^ &num &name your computer in 'safe mode " 
^ &num run a full virus scan , and repair all files that are detected as w32.funlove.4099 . 
^ delete all files detected as &email or &website . 
^ &num delete the value 
^ regedit 
^ that the worm added to the registry key 
^ hkey_local_machinesoftwaremicrosoftwindowscurrentversionrun 
^ if the worm is resident in memory , however , it may disable your scanner so you may need to delete the entry first , then reboot . 
^ for more in-depth info and removal instructions , check out 
^ &website 
^ thanks , 
^ &name
