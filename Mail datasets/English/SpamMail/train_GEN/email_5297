^ natural language and information processing group seminar &website / 
^ 12pm , tuesday 21st january , &name 
^ &org , &name &name building , &name &name avenue &website 
^ &name : grammatical relations , &name &name and question answering 
^ speaker : &name &name - university of &name 
^ &name : 
^ in this talk , i will give an overview of my phd thesis work on automatically finding grammatical relations to verbs in english . 
^ grammatical relations ( &name ) , such as subject , direct object , temporal or locative adjunct , are interesting from a theoretical as well as from a practical point of view because they constitute a link between syntax and semantics . 
^ &num approach to finding &name is to have a parser construct a full parse of a sentence and to extract &name from the parse tree afterwards . 
^ by contrast , our relation finder directly extracts grammatical relations from part-of-speech tagged and chunked text . 
^ the relation finder is implemented through a supervised machine learning algorithm , viz . 
^ &name &name . 
^ i will briefly explain &name &name , show how &char derived training and test material from the &name &name and give a summary of results . 
^ in the second part , i will show how &name can be used for open domain question answering ( qa ) on the &name . 
^ i will introduce the &name task and its evaluation , explain how &char implemented a &name prototype and show examples of successes and failures . 
^ ( all welcome - for instructions on how to get to the &org , please see : &website )
