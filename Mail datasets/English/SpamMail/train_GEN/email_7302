^ no further things for me to say about stuff for the &name int slot plan this week ( week &num already ! ! ) , but there 's a copy down the bottom of this email if you want it and you 've lost it ! 
^ the main plug of this email is to say it would be wonderful if you could advertise the first meeting of the &name cultural missions group which is happening this sunday , &num : 30pm in the world missions office at the &name &name &name ( signposted when you get there ! ) the &name cultural missions group is a group , similar to what used to be called &num : &num , for christians who are thinking of working cross-culturally in the long term , however vaguely . 
^ it would be really good if you could advertise this to your college groups , maybe particularly mentioning it to people you know who might be interested . 
^ below is &name 's email explaining whats happening , which you might like to copy and paste and send to anyone you know who might be interested ... would be &char helpful if anyone thinking of coming on sunday could email &name &email

^ dear all , 
^ i 'm writing to you to tell you about the &name cultural missions group which is starting this term , and to invite you to come for tea on sunday 24th november at the &name &name &name - &name &name 's office - at &num : &num to find out more about it . 
^ the main aim of the &name is to enable people who are interested in cross cultural mission - whether that means in &name or abroad , working for a missionary organisation or as a christian within a secular organisation - 
^ to meet up and pray , to focus our thoughts and plans , to think about some of the issues involved , to envision and encourage one another , to explore the specific resourses available on cross cultural opportunities , to hear speakers who have direct experience in the relevant areas , to put people in contact with people who work in the area they are interested in , where possible . 
^ i hope that it can be very much developed around the specific needs of whoever comes and so will be a very practical and applied encouragement . 
^ we will meet only once or twice a term , and hopefully we will have a meal each time and then pray and talk . 
^ please come along on sunday , and bring anyone who you think will be interested . 
^ please let me know if you think you can come so i have a rough idea how many muffins to buy ! 
^ i look forward to seeing you , love &name 
^ &name : &num &name &name college

^ and here 's the week &num plan ... 
^ week &num : praying for &name 's work worldwide ... pray for the spread of the gospel elsewhere in the world ... if your college group has a certain place they always pray for then introduce that , otherwise operation world or &name leaders ( details from &name &name ) or the weekly &name prayer diary are 
^ all good resources . 
^ why not pray for the cu in &name ? 
^ if you have been to the intbrek in week &num then you will have fodder for this ! 
^ thats all !
