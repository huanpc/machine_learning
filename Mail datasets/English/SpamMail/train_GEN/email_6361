^ hello mr. &name ! 
^ i like your program " icon replacer " very much and because i 've just found out about the fascination of programming a few months ago , i 'd like to request whether you could perhaps give me a little hint on how to replace the icon of an .exe file . 
^ i 've searched the internet for some examples , but i have n't found one yet . 
^ of course , ( or perhaps ) you do n't want to give away your idea to anybody you even do n't know , but it would be really very nice if you could give an unexperienced programming newbie a small tip &smiley . 
^ thank you very much ! 
^ greetings , &name
