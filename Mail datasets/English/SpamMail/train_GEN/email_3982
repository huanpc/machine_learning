^ hi &name , 
^ well , life is full of surprises , as i found out yesterday morning when i saw &name and &name in my sitting room . 
^ i was speechless and very very shocked , but very very happy . 
^ anyway , i 've had an absolutely wonderful &num days and really really enjoyed seeing them both again . 
^ we went a walk along the coast , played biblical trivial pursuits ( very hard questions and &name won but not by much . 
^ she was really surprisingly competitive without you or &name there to eclipse her ) , went to church , ate nice food , watched &name &name , talked , watched &name play with my brother 's gun ( she 's a natural disturbing really ) it 's made me remember why i want to come back to &name to see all my wonderful friends again ! 
^ " how are you feeling ? 
^ do you want me to pick up lecture notes for you ? 
^ who from and for what ? 
^ when are you coming back ? 
^ i miss having you here 
^ - i 'm feeling very well . 
^ imagine i feel normal and then take away the fact that i have not got quite perfect energy levels and still a few wounds to finish healing and my right chest is still a little tender . 
^ apart from that i 'm doing well . 
^ i 'm hopefully coming back on saturday the 26th of january , but that is still to be confirmed not the least of which by my consultant at the hospital ! 
^ thanks very much for offering to pick up lecture notes . 
^ &name is photocopying hers for me , but i 'll just wait until i get back until i get them as i still have lots of work from last term which i can be getting on with . 
^ anyway , i am praying for you and hope you are soon feeling your old self again . 
^ i look forward to seeing you soon . 
^ &name 
^ &name if you feel like it there is a letter , which will be arriving in my pigeonhole on tuesday morning . 
^ it 's from the university and if you would n't mind could you open it for me and tell me how much they think they 're talking out of my bank account to pay my tuition fees ? 
^ that would be great !
