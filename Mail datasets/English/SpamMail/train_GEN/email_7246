^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : &name &name &name could enable &name &name ( q329115 ) released : &num september &num &name : &num november &num ( version &num ) &name : &name &name , &name office for &name , &name &name explorer for &name , or &name &name &name for &name . 
^ &name : identity spoofing and , in some cases , ability to gain control over a user 's system . 
^ &name &name : important 
^ &name : ms02-050 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ reason for &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d the original version of this bulletin was released on &num september &num . 
^ on &num september &num , we updated the bulletin to advise customers that a microsoft-issued digital certificate , used to sign device drivers , did not meet the stricter validation standards established by the patch . 
^ as a result , customers who installed the patch could see unexpected error messages when installing new hardware , or in some cases might be unable to install new hardware altogether . 
^ on &num november &num , we released an updated version of the patch that not only eliminates this problem , but also eliminates a newly discovered variant of the original vulnerability . 
^ &name : &name &website certificate standard defines several optional fields that can be included in a digital certificate . 
^ one of these is the basic constraints field , which indicates the maximum allowable length of the certificate 's chain and whether the certificate is a certificate authority or an end-entity certificate . 
^ however , the &name within &name that construct and validate certificate chains ( &name ( ) , &name ( ) , and &name ( ) ) do not check the basic constraints field . 
^ the same flaw , unrelated to &name , is also present in several &name products for &name . 
^ the vulnerability identified in the original version of the bulletin could enable an attacker who had a valid end-entity certificate to issue a subordinate certificate that , although bogus , would nevertheless pass validation . 
^ because &name is used by a wide range of applications , this could enable a variety of identity spoofing attacks . 
^ these are discussed in detail in the &name , but could include : 
^ - setting up a web site that poses as a different web site , and " proving " its identity by establishing an &name session as the legitimate web site . 
^ - sending emails signed using a digital certificate that purportedly belongs to a different user . 
^ - &name certificate-based authentication systems to gain entry as a highly privileged user . 
^ - digitally signing malware using an authenticode certificate that claims to have been issued to a company users might trust . 
^ the newly discovered vulnerability announced on &num november &num is closely related to the one discussed in the original version of the bulletin and , like that vulnerability , involves a flaw in the way certificate validation is performed . 
^ however , this vulnerability could enable an attacker to gain control over a user 's system . 
^ because a fix for this vulnerability was not included in the original version of the patch , &name strongly recommends that customers install the new patch , even if they installed the original version of the patch . 
^ only &name &name &num , &name &num second edition , &name &name &num , and &name &name &num , terminal server edition are affected by this variant . 
^ mitigating factors : &name overall : 
^ - the user could always manually check a certificate chain , and might notice in the case of a spoofed chain that there was an unfamiliar intermediate ca . 
^ - unless the attacker 's digital certificate were issued by &char ca in the user 's trust list , the certificate would generate a warning when validated . 
^ - the attacker could only spoof certificates of the same type as the one he or she possessed . 
^ in the case where the attacker attempted an attack using a high-value certificate such as authenticode certificates , this would necessitate obtaining a legitimate certificate of the same type - which could require the attacker to prove his or her identity or entitlement to the issuing ca . 
^ web &name &name : 
^ - the vulnerability provides no way for the attacker to cause the user to visit the attacker 's web site . 
^ the attacker would need to redirect the user to a site under the attacker 's control using a method such as &name poisoning . 
^ as discussed in the &name , this is extremely difficult to carry out in practice . 
^ - the vulnerability could not be used to extract information from the user 's computer . 
^ the vulnerability could only be used by an attacker as a means of convincing a user that he or she has reached a trusted site , in the hope of persuading the user to voluntarily provide sensitive data . 
^ email signing : 
^ - the " from " address on the spoofed mail would need to match the one specified in the certificate , giving rise to either of &num scenarios if a recipient replied to the mail . 
^ in the case where the " from " and 'reply-to " fields matched , replies would be sent to victim of the attack rather than the attacker . 
^ in the case where the fields did n't match , replies would obviously be addressed to someone other than ostensible sender . 
^ either case could be a tip-off that an attack was underway . 
^ certificate-based authentication : 
^ - in most cases where certificates are used for user authentication , additional information contained within the certificate is necessary to complete the authentication . 
^ the type and format of such data typically varies with every installation , and as a result significant insider information would likely be required for a successful attack . 
^ &name &name : 
^ - to the best of &name 's knowledge , such an attack could not be carried out using any commercial ca 's authenticode certificates . 
^ these certificates contain policy information that causes the basic constraints field to be correctly evaluated , and none allow end-entity certificates to act as &name . 
^ - even if an attack were successfully carried out using an authenticode certificate that had been issued by a corporate &name , it would n't be possible to avoid warning messages , as trust in authenticode is brokered on a per-certificate , not per-name , basis . 
^ &name &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d 
^ - important 
^ note : responding to customer feedback , &name updated its severity rating system november &num , &num . 
^ security bulletins that originally posted under the old system - before november &num , &num - and are later re-released under the new system , will reflect the severity rating assessed under the new revised system severity rating criteria 
^ &name availability : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d 
^ - a patch is available to fix this vulnerability . 
^ please read the security bulletin at &website for information on obtaining this patch .
