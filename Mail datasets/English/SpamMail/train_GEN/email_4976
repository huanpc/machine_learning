^ i do n't think i will be going . 
^ i doubt they will need all &num authors to present . 
^ plus i will still be in &name next june , in the middle of my &name dissertation . 
^ very funny ( but somewhat true ) about not really needing good english skills in my field . 
^ but , i also think that other coutries " education system is the more likely reason . 
^ they start maths and computers earlier in school , and place a more important emphasis on them . 
^ plus , it is " cooler " to be a computer-scientist in other coutries than it is in the &name ( where it has been stigmatized as being a nerd profession ) . 
^ finally , other coutries seem to understand that in order to compete in the 
^ world economy in the future , they must be on the forefront of current technologies . 
^ i figured out why they do n't have groundhog day in &name . 
^ there is n't any question of whether the groundhog will see its shadow or not . 
^ everyday 
^ is so grey this time of year that the probability of shadow-seeing is almost &num .

^ very nice . 
^ while you 're there , see if you can get me an autograph from m r. ( i think ) &name ... and time how long it takes him to sign . 
^ it 's really amazing the extent to which foreigners have taken over the field . 
^ i read a report in a magazine ( i think either business week or the &name &name ) about how the industry is being taken over by non-americans . 
^ it said that foreigners who are uncomfortable with the english language and / or the american culture have been able to find refuge by working in the international languages of math and computers where they have limited interpersonal interaction and that usually comes with nerds who are similiarly uncomfortable in social relationships . 
^ i was amused . 
^ it seems i have another publication ... yes there were &num other names listed on it ... but the name " abadi " comes to the rescue ! 
^ this is not the same as my &name journal paper , which would be a much bigger deal if it gets accepted ( the one i was working on in september instead of getting ready for &name ) .
