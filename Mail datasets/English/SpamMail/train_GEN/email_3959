^ i think we 're all aware that &name is particularly bad at replying to any form of communication , however lovely he may otherwise be . 
^ it was not slander , but &name fact . 
^ additionally , &name has nothing on me ; thus why he can reveal nothing . 
^ love to all !

^ ladies and gentlemen , 
^ i would like to distance myself from a particularly nasty remark made by a certain miss &name , insinuating that i am , how shall i say , " bad " at replying to emails . 
^ i would just like to make it perfectly clear that i am great at replying to emails , and that you are welcome to put me to the test . 
^ i would like to return the complement to miss &name by revealing some shocking item of underhand information that i am privy to , but i guess i 'll rise above it ( or at least save it for a rainy day ) . 
^ regards and all , 
^ &name
