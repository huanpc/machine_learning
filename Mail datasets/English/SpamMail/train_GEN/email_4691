^ &name &name , 
^ i am writing the beginning of this letter to you in a strange , impersonal , robot-like fashion because : 
^ &num ) you actually are a robot . 
^ &num ) you secretly wish that you were a robot . 
^ &num ) you have at some point in your life been significantly affected by a robot . 
^ if none of these apply then you are a small-minded sad little man . 
^ the reason for my impersonal email was that i sent it to load of people , but to your old email address , so i then had to send it to your new one , which was why you might possibly have been fooled into thinking it was a personal email . 
^ anyway ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ so , enough cheek to my older and wiser friend ! 
^ well done on the results . 
^ i imagine that you expect to get over &num in your last assignment , will this lead to your average being over &num ? 
^ would this put you top of the year and be enough for funding ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ so many questions ... 
^ i 've got some possibilities on the horizon , but it 's too early to say for sure about anything yet , so i 'll leave it until i see you in person on the &name trip ( which i 'm very glad your coming on by the way ) . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i expect your anxious to know whether or not &name has spread to the city where i live . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ you guessed it &name ... 
^ glad to hear you 're ok . 
^ i 'll trust you 're taking all necessary precautions . 
^ it sounds pretty bad from the news reports . 
^ when you get back , you can look forward to many green places &name ... 
^ love &name
