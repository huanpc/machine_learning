! ^ be consistent ! ^  ame , you 've been to  ame how cool ! ^ did you see our chips ? ^ so , have they finally got the address lists printed now ? ^ did you manage to get a copy of it ? ^ you could n't send / scan / e-mail me a copy of it possibly could you ? ^ you do n't have to , but do so if you would like to as  ame and i could do with one so that we can send christmas cards to our fell group . ^ now that you have your computer connected you may wish to consider " netscape instant messaging service . ^ no , i do n't work for them ! ^ forgive me for trying to be so intuitive , but could you possibly , feasibly , be looking forward to seeing your sister  ame on saturday ? ? ? ^ no , i thought not . ^  ame . ^ well , my shift in the shop was great fun ! ^ i got lots of chemistry done ( ! ) and had a generally good day . ^ yes , i sold quite a bit which is always quite nice . ^ yes , i like operating the till , but i do n't tend to salivate over it as it would appear you did strictly reading between the lines . ^ however , the till made a funny noise at me yesterday so i do n't know if it still likes me . ^ glad to hear you 've been till-trained . ^ so few people are these days . ^ it is a dying ritual . ^ perhaps when you are being rude to yourself you are really being honest about yourself yes no. oh , i 'm sure you 're not ! ^ anyway , have you heard the latest from  ame ? ^ quite a stunning revelation if you ask me , but i could see it coming . ^ he 'd been acting quite strangely in our flat for some time . ^ he 'd also been acting quite strangely in your flat too ask  ame . ^ he accompanied me downstairs to get a bin liner from her  um day . ^ curiouser and curiouser . ^ anyway , his latest personal statement ^  har quote from  ame ; " i have similar characteristics to an amphibious-type creature who has evolved  um million years in a few hours and has mysteriously taken on the form of a large slug with uncontrollable mating habits ^ well ! ! ! ^  ame of that what you will , but the consequences are perfectly clear to me ! ^ actually , they are not . ^ do you have any ideas ? ^ let me know quickly , before it 's too late ! ^ now  ame , a request do you have any pictures of characters from  ame  ame /  ame  ame  um ? ^ i was especially looking for  ame ,  ame , the  um little aliens ,  ame , and basically everything . ^ also , do you have the kind of " picture that says "  ame  ame  um kind of like the same thing as you had for " voyager ? ^ if you do have any of the above stuff , then would you e-mail it to me ? ^ i think that the final outcome of my little project in computer-animation land might quite amuse you ! ^ anyway whatever ^ so , i 'm working again tomorrow . ^ today i was wallpapering very tedious ! ^ what have you been up to ? ^ well , i look forward to hearing from you again soon . ^  ame ^  ame did you see any germs around  ame  har ? ^ i hope not . ^ you see , i think they will see these holidays as an opportunity to attempt to take over the flat . ^ we shall have live next term in fully protective biohazard suits . ^ i hope the girls do n't mind being ever so slightly unfashionable but high strength germ-resistant plastic is coming in , is n't it ?
