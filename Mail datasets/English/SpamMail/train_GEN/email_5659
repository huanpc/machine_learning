^ &name
^ this year we plan to organise an &name &name in the &name &name ( near the welsh border ) . 
^ the provisional dates for the &name are saturday 12th april to thursday 17th april i.e. the last week of the &name holiday ( &name sunday is on 20th april , and full term begins on tuesday 22nd april ) . 
^ this is slightly later than usual due to the fact that &name is late this year , and so the hostels wo n't be fully open until mid-april . 
^ the cost should be approximately &num pounds per person , including accommodation and food ( both provided by youth hostels ) . 
^ this does not include transport costs for getting to and from the area . 
^ there will also be some additional transport costs during the holiday , as we cannot always walk directly from hostel to hostel , so will take the bus or train part of the way . 
^ i estimate these costs to be about &num pounds . 
^ the walking will be fairly strenuous , as we will be walking between &num and &num miles a day carrying fairly heavy rucksacks , but hopefully the scenery should make up for this ! 
^ the provisional itinerary is as follows : 
^ sat 12th april : meet in &name . 
^ stay overnight in &name &name &name 13th april : walk to &name along the &name &name , going over the &name ( a &num foot " hump " with views of the &name hills to the south , and the flatter land to the north ) . 
^ stay overnight in &name &name . 
^ mon 14th april : continue along the &name &name , through the medieval market town of much &name , and along &name &name . 
^ stay overnight in &name manor &name . 
^ &name 15th april walk from &name &name to &name , over the &name &name ( a range of hills with spectacular views ) and on to &name &name where we spend the night . 
^ wed 16th april a circular walk from &name &name , taking in the stiperstones . 
^ stay overnight at &name &name . 
^ &name 17th april returning to &name , from where people will travel home . 
^ this is subject to the hostels having enough spaces available , and public transport running on the appropriate days . 
^ places will be limited to about &num , as beyond that booking hostels will become difficult . 
^ if you are interested in coming please reply to this email by &name 7th &name , and i will make provisional bookings during the christmas holiday . 
^ i will need a final decision as to whether you can come at the beginning of &name term and payment for the accommodation in january . 
^ best wishes 
^ &name ( secretary ) 
^ if you would like to be removed from this list , please send an email to &email
