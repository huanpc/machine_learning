^ hi &name , 
^ i 'm going to &name with &name tmr for &name interview ... could you write to dr &name and &name about formal , ( separately but mentioning that we are inviting the other person as well ) 
^ i think &name mentioned that he ca n't do formal on thursday ... could you check with everyone as to which day they prefer ? 
^ friday is the weekend which might be good for us , but then you have to consider whether dr &name / &name would prefer to spend it with their family ... stuff like that . 
^ monday might be good since it 's close to the presentation and we can do a lot of heavy hinting / propaganda and get &name to come to our presentation ... 
^ could you write the email signed as all group memebers . 
^ &name
