^ hi professor &name , 
^ just got back from &name - talked to christian , &name , &name , and &name . 
^ anyway , &name and &name brought up the point that &num advantage of going to &name over an &org or &name would be that it would be easier to differentiate oneself from the other students to get a good recommendation , should i want to apply for faculty positions after i graduate . 
^ i had n't thought of this , and was wondering what you thought , given that you went through the application process recently after graduating &name . 
^ do you think you would have done better if you went to a school with a bigger name , or did being one of the best students at &name help you ? 
^ sorry to bother you ... there 's no rush to answer this question . 
^ either way , &name and &name convinced me that &name should still remain in consideration . 
^ anyway , it was nice to see you today and catch up . 
^ &name
