^ hi &name , 
^ as &name found out , sentence [ &num ] in &name has &num bytes and is too long for the current memory buffer ( default &num bytes ) . 
^ so use the constructor with a buffer size : 
^ &name rmrs ( &num ) ; 
^ instead of 
^ &name rmrs ; 
^ and slowly upgrade this should you run into this problem again for future sentences . 
^ - &name
