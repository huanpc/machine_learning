^ that was quite good , especially for a free event ! 
^ also had quite a &char ot of garden parties over the last few days as well as &num concerts i 've sung in and &num concerts i 've been along to , so alongside organisat ion for next year 's &name concert and various other bits and pieces , it 's been quite a busy may week ! 
^ it 's been great though to catch up with friends who i saw very little of over the exam period and to be able to relax with no pressure of work !

^ as for me , i 'm hoping to ge &char a job and work over the summer to earn enough money to pay through my financial shortfall for next year and hopefully have enough left over to do some extras such as &name houseparty and &char may ball . 
^ it 's local evangelism in the work-place ! 
^ i shall also be going to &name for ju st under a fortnight with my family where we should be doing a fair bit of walking which should be good . 
^ not sure yet where we are going in &name nce ; my parents may have decided by now , but given that we 'll be camping , the decision can be fairly last-minute . 
^ take care and all the best for the summer ,
