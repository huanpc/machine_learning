^ hey thanks for sorting this all out . 
^ i 've got completely confused about who 's supposed to be coming and who is n't, but i think the numbers are about right and we 'll see who turns up . 
^ anyway , how much do we owe you ? 
^ you actually managed to choose a great time to come round the other day- you got the very slim time slot between us getting back from &name &name and my dad finding out he had tick bite fever . 
^ i know , i know . 
^ it 's just another day in the &name house . 
^ i go back to &name next saturday though . 
^ see you thursday at &num : &num &name 
^ hi ! 
^ just to confirm that i 've got the tickets for thursday 's performance at the &name &name . 
^ it starts at 7.45pm - shall we therefore meet there at &num ? 
^ sorry i managed to choose a bad time to come round the other day , i realise that after travelling you do n't tend to be in the best frame of mind . 
^ did you go anywhere interesting ? 
^ see you soon , 
^ &name
