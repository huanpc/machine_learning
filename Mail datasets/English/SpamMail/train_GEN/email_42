^ natural language and information processing group seminar &website / 
^ 12pm , tuesday 28th january , &name 
^ &org , &name &name building , &name &name avenue &website 
^ &name : document filtering : tasks , models and implementation 
^ speaker : &name &name - &name research 
^ &name : 
^ much information retrieval research revolves around a canonical model of a search task : a user issuing a query to a ( temporarily static ) document collection , and being presented with a ranked list of documents ( with perhaps a feedback loop ) . 
^ this model informs many aspects of the work 
^ - - the kinds of theoretical approach taken , many implementation issues including the design of efficient , fast-response systems , the measurement of effectiveness and the qualitative testing of systems . 
^ however , we may take a number of different views of the information task itself and the user context in which that task occurs . 
^ &num alternative is represented by the filtering task , as defined for the &name exercise . 
^ here filtering is seen as a content-based , adaptive task applied to an incoming stream of documents , involving user needs represented by profiles . 
^ in this talk , i will explore the nature of this task , and some of the ways in which it must be treated differently from the canonical model . 
^ i will address both conceptual and implementation issues , and discuss some experimental results from &name . 
^ ( all welcome - for instructions on how to get to the &org , please see : &website )
