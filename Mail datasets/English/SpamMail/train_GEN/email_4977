^ so given that last names are often derived from what profession that family used to be in ( e.g. &name , &name , etc. ) , what do you think that dr. &name 's ancestors used to be ? 
^ &name 
^ announcement and call for papers 
^ 9th international conference on fuzzy theory and technology ( &name &num ) 
^ september &num , &num &name , &name &name , &name 
^ program chair : &name &name &name ( &email ) 
^ ft&t &num is part of the 7th joint conference on information sciences ( &name ) , that will be held in &name , &name , &name , from september &num till september &num , &num . 
^ ft&t &num will concentrate on the mathematical foundations of fuzzy logic in a broad as well as in a narrow sense and all kind of application domains of these theories of fuzziness . 
^ more particular we will welcome papers on the following theoretical issues and their applications : 
^ - fuzzy topology including fuzzy metric spaces and smooth topological spaces . 
^ - fuzzy algebraic structures such as fuzzy groups , fuzzy rings , fuzzy vector spaces . 
^ - fuzzy numbers and arithmetical operations , including ranking procedures for fuzzy numbers . 
^ - fuzzy intuitionistic sets . 
^ - interval-valued fuzzy sets . 
^ - &name sets , fuzzy rough sets . 
^ - l-fuzzy sets . 
^ - links between different models of imprecision and uncertainty . 
^ - fuzzy relational structures , including fuzzy relational equations , fuzzy similarity relations and fuzzy orderings . 
^ - fuzzy geometry . 
^ - uncertainty theories including possibility and necessity theory , plausibility and belief measures , imprecise probabilities . 
^ - logical operations , including t-norms , t-conorms , implications , fuzzy quantifiers . 
^ - measures of fuzziness . 
^ - defuzzification techniques . 
^ - fuzzy measures and fuzzy integrals . 
^ - &name multivalued mappings . 
^ - fuzzy differential calculus . 
^ - fuzzy mathematical morphology . 
^ as practical applications we will especially welcome papers on fuzzy relational databases , fuzzy image processing , linguistic variables , fuzzy decision making and preference structures , fuzzy expert systems , fuzzy reliability theory . 
^ we heartily welcome organizations of special sessions on specific topics containing &num to &num contributions
