^ hi &name , thanks for your &num letters . 
^ we always enjoy knowing how life is going over there and what is new with you . 
^ we hope that you had a wonderful birthday . 
^ i did n't know where to send your birthday card as i did n't know where you would be . 
^ i sent it to &name and it probably arrived right after you left . 
^ oh well , i 'm sure you will get it sometime . 
^ everyone is fine over here . 
^ i ca n't remember if i told you our plans for the summer yet or not . 
^ &name also got accepted to work as a &name at a catholic boys camp and he is really looking forward to that . 
^ it sounds like a great program and he even gets paid for it . 
^ &name is still waiting to hear whether his camp job at the same camp will be as a tripper to &name park with the campers or as swim staff or counsellor . 
^ he really wants the tripper job ! 
^ i 'm sure some fo the farewells would be very envious if he was in &name for a summer . 
^ so - that means that &name and &name will be gone for the whole summer other than a 3-day trek home in august ( &num - &num ) . 
^ &name is back at school after his jaunt over to &name a week ago . 
^ he had a great trip and really enjoyed himself . 
^ he says that so far school is pretty good . 
^ since the boys seem to be settled for the summer , &name and i have decided to take a trip in august . 
^ our school board and another &num are sponsoring a trip to &name in august to the holy land . 
^ it is a &num day &name &name and goes to most of the places that &name visited . 
^ we go on august &num and return august &num . 
^ it sounds like a terrific trip and we can hardly wait . 
^ we will take lots of pictures and will have to tell you all about it when we return . 
^ the tour guide is someone that has spoken at a couple of retreats that i have attended . 
^ she is a wonderful , very funny , irish lady who is a retired teacher . 
^ luckily , not everyone on the trip is a teacher or i do n't think that &name would be able to put up with us all . 
^ well i must go and get some work done around here . 
^ take care and good luck with your exams ! ! ! ! ! 
^ &name hard ! ! ! 
^ love &name and boys
