^ just a couple of nominations from the club curry : 
^ &char &name &name for &name himself  &num ; &name can take his pick from comments such as  &name needs a social life? &num ; and it was much more chilled during my first time &num ; . 
^ a junior &name &name for &name . 
^ this one might seem a little harsh , but it 's tough catching &name , and &name needs some company on the mungo charts . 
^ having been given the responsibility to organise the curry with a simple mandate to find a place with a meal deal ( to make paying easier ) , what did i have to personally negotiate with the manager for on arrival ( yes you guessed it &num ; ) . 
^ &name first denied any record of being asked to sort out a meal deal , then admitted that i may have mentioned it , then a few minutes later recalled calling around about it but , in the last act of dodgy memory , forgot what the outcome had been &num ;
