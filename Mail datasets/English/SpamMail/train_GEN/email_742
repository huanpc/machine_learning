^ &name ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ it has been quite a long haul , but i 'm really glad i 've done it . 
^ who knows what doors it will open in the future as well . 
^ &name is good like that . 
^ today my brother and i drove back to the house we used to live in &num years ago . 
^ we met some of our old neighbours , who at first asked us if we were lost , and then when we told them who we were they ahhhed and oohhhed , and then invited us in for a drink . 
^ we have not seen them for &num years ! 
^ it was really great . 
^ my new sound module sounds great . 
^ i 've got some excellent piano sounds - thought you might be pleased to know that . 
^ so , i hope your one-day-a-week job is not taxing you too much &name . 
^ listen , do n't tire yourself working so much - it 's just not worth it . 
^ anyway , enough of the sarcasm . 
^ &name all is well . 
^ we must talk about flat stuff soon . 
^ large it &name , 
^ pb 
^ &name oh , by the way , i would treat reports of &name frying ravens ( or whatever it was ) with very great suspicion . 
^ let us not forget that she has attempted to trick us in the past ( and failed ) and very likely will try again . 
^ i 'm sure if there was any danger to &name himself , his ambassadors would have her eliminated before you could say " &name 's claw " .
