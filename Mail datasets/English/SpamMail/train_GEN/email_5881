^ hi everyone 
^ i 've just had a look at " &name " 
^ it appears that everything is still working , except for a " public static void main ... " method that is being used for testing . 
^ the version in the repository , at the time of writing this email , does not compile , but these lines are not required for the class definition anyway , so we should n't worry about that . 
^ &name - keep looking at gaussian elimination - why not get in contact with &name to work out where this process is happening . 
^ this leaves the problem of finishing the distribution of quadratic sieve . 
^ unfortunately , i wo n't be available on monday afternoon , due to unavoidable committments . 
^ i am available however on monday evening , and will be in the intel laboratory then . 
^ &name - i gather you are really busy at the moment . 
^ &name , if you or anyone else is available to look at the quadratic sieve distribution - the problem is nearly complete - please have a chat with &name . 
^ see you tomorrow ... 
^ all the best 
^ &name

^ i 've just checked in a working version of the distribution system , &name . 
^ it passes the tests i wrote , and there is thus no more to do on it until we can break it . 
^ what is the status of lima.m.f.quadraticsieve. * ? 
^ the version &name showed me yesterday was working , but the current version does n't compile . 
^ i am down to sort out the gaussian elimination side of things , but i ca n't find the code that is doing it . 
^ we should meet in the intel lab after monday 's lectures and and get everything ready for tuesday 's hand-in deadline . 
^ &name " nothing would please me more than being able to hire &num programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software . " - &name &name &num
