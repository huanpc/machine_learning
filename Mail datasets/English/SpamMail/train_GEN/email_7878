^ " &name n't very nice but oh well . 
^ at least she had n't slashed her wrists like i was told . 
^ scary stuff . 
^ i also suppose you 've been told we 're getting new &name tickets . 
^ beauty ! 
^ not that it affects you coz &name &name 's getting your ticket . 
^ only jokin " , &name . 
^ mind you , i should give him it since you were slagging my football team . 
^ for your information , we are a brilliant team this season buthave only played really good teams which is why we 've been losing . 
^ and my head has n't grown any bigger since i 've been getting my name in the paper all the time .

^ &name , i hear you say ! 
^ maybe not , then . 
^ at &name on saturday i was speaking to &name , &name &name , &name and &name &name ( who is soooo nice by the by) . 
^ " &name rather excellent . 
^ until someone pinched &name 's top ( a &name strip i might add-how sad ! ) and he wandered about topless . 
^ what a poser ! 
^ although i ca n't say he probably noticed coz he was kinda bleezin' . 
^ i have way too much homework right now and i 'm going to fail all my courses . 
^ i have a programming assignment to finish for the end of november , my &name 1st draft to do for the 3rd december ( which i have n't started - i 'll start the night , i 'm sure ) and my &name &char and computing investigations to do . 
^ i 've hardly done anything for my computing one . 
^ it 's not very funny . 
^ that 's why i think i should go and do some homework but dad is asking if you want your mail sent down to you - you 've got some letters ( &num on her majesty 's secret service , minus the " secret " - it 's from the student awards agency ) and a certificate , do n't know who it 's from .
