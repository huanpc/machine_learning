^ i 'll try &smiley 
^ when you construct the historgram , you go through a training text and count how many words have the angles between them and their histories in the range of &num through &num / &num degrees . 
^ lets call this set1 . 
^ then you count all the words with angles in the range of &num / &num through &num * ( &num / &num ) . 
^ let 's say this is set2 . 
^ and so on up to set200 . 
^ then you normalize these counts ; i.e. &char ( setn)|setn|/ ( &char ... +|set200 | ) . 
^ to compute a prob of &char ( &char , &char ) , you compute the angle between &char and &char , then find the &name to which this angle falls and assign &char ( &char , &char ) &char ( &name ) . 
^ &char ( &char , &char ) in this email is denoted as &char ( &char ( &char , &char ) ) in the text . 
^ after this you do further normalization ( &num ) to get &char ( w|d ) . 
^ does this help ?

^ hi , i going through your thesis on &name . 
^ i was wondering if you could explain to me how &name 's method to find the probability works . 
^ you have a histogram of number of occurences of that angle ( &char -axis ) and the angle between the word and the document ( &char axis ) of the training data . 
^ could tell me how the probability &char ( &char , &char ) is calculated from this graph . 
^ if possible give me an example . 
^ it is mentioned in the middle of pg &num . 
^ thanks ,
