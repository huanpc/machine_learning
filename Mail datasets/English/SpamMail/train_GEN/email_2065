" . ^ this struck me as rather odd . ^ to say the least . ^ i decided to continue my stalking and discover what else he had to say about  ame . ^ i soon discovered a deep dark secret which this quiet green-hatted guy was concealing . ^ as far as i am aware , the following quote is accurate , word for word : 'so i killed him . ^ i fed him my almond slices . ^ however , he was not aware that the almonds were filled with cyanide . ^  ame ,  ame . ^  ame is dead ! " . ^ the girl only laughed ( innocently ) . ^ she obviously thought he was joking , or was refusing to believe that her friend could be a murderer . ^ i decided there and then that i would follow my trail to the end , and discover the truth at all costs . ^ i also knew that it was essential for me to keep an eye on the girl as , if what the guy said was true , she may be his next victim . ^ i could not follow most of their conversation for the rest of the day as they walked so incredibly fast that i found it difficult to keep up . ^ they went to a place called 'st  ame 's college " and asked about some shirts belonging to a guy called " his lordship " ; they went into a bank where the girl nearly fell asleep ( as did i ) while waiting for the guy to finish talking to the assistant ; the girl ate a whole  ame bun ; the girl was informed by a certain gardener that she has huge feet . . ... etc. throughout the day i kept hearing the name of  ame , but could never catch the rest of the talk - until about 4pm -ish when i heard the guy clearly and distinctly say "  ame must die ! " . ^ this threw me a bit , as i had earlier heard him recount how he had killed the creature . ^ however , it is evidence , and is therefore essential to this tale . ^ i could only assume that he was , yet again , re-living ( with relish ) his murderous plot and execution of it . ^ throughout , the girl was laughing and mocking his speeches , so i can only assume that she is naive enough to think that he was only joking . ^ however , i knew better . ^ i am highly regarded for my judgement of character , and could see by the dark and sinister look in this guy 's eye that he truly meant what he said . ^ another interesting twist follows . ^ on their return to the station , the guy stopped and pointed at a black feather on the ground . ^ i heard none of their conversation at this point , but could see by the fear in the guy 's eye that he was worried by the sight of it . ^ he absolutely refused to handle it , but decided that he would mail it to someone called "  ame  ame " . ^ you may know of this person . ^ i had never heard of him before , but concluded that he must be a good guy as he has such a title ( although these things can often be deceptive ) , and the guy and girl both spoke well of him . ^ i would not trust the opinion of the guy - murderers are evil - but the girl , i knew , could be trusted . ^ anyway , the girl was forced to carry this feather to the station , but there it was abandoned . ^ this puzzled me , but i soon realised why . ^ the guy had planned to send it to "  ame  ame " as evidence that they had sighted  ame . ^ however , on the girl mentioning that the feather was rather battered and showed evidence of  ame being in a fight , the guy changed his mind and decided that "  ame  ame " would n't want it . ^ so , it was discarded on the platform . ^ not known to either , i picked it up as i followed them onto the train . ^ i have not mentioned , for fear of my safety , that i am actually a fully-trained crime detective who used to work for the police force . ^ this information is essential for you to believe the following . ^ i carry with me a small bag of useful items , of which is included that wonderful stuff know as " finger-tip dust " . ^ while the guy 's back was turned , i carried out a finger-tip test on the inside door on the train which the guy had touched as he went to find a seat . ^ i kept a copy of the prints which i found there . ^ at the first station we came to , the girl disembarked . ^ i followed , knowing she was now safe from the clutches of her murderous friend . ^ the last thing i saw of him was his sinister and smug expression as the train groaned out of the station . ^ i lost all track of the girl as i was distracted by the exiting train . ^ however , i knew it was not important to follow her . ^ she , i am certain , was innocent of any involvement . ^ it is the guy in the green hat who is guilty . ^ and i have proof . ^ at no point did the guy actually handle the feather which i managed to save . ^ however , on my getting home and conducting a finger-tip search on it , i discovered an exact match with the  um of the guy 's from on the train door . ^ how could they be there if he had n't handled the feather ? ^  ame . ^ he had obviously handled  ame at some point , and that would have been at the time of his murder . ^ how the feather got to where it was , we shall probably never know , but it is clear that the guy had had some contact with it in the past . ^ a very dangerous guy he is indeed . ^ i include a description of him for any photo-fits that may be necessary to be published : ^ - short , gel-less , mousey-brown hair . ^ this hairstyle , i heard him mention , has been the same since he was little . ^ -  ame and  ame ^ - black shoes ^ - navy blue coat ^ - light brown jeans ^ -  ame full of all sorts of stuff : box of tissues , towel , pen , notepad ,  ame ( for measuring cracks in the walls of his flat ) . . ... ^ - spoke with a mild scottish accent : seemed to turn irish when he said the word "  um " ^ - seemed to condescend to answering to the name of "  ame " ^ i urge you : if you see this guy , do not approach him . ^ he is highly dangerous . ^ you should call the police at once . ^ as i said , as far as i am aware , all the above facts are true . ^ i hope my tale sheds a little more light on the mystery of  ame . ^ i can only assume that he lies in some small grave somewhere . ^  har grave of  ame 's making . ^  ame  ame . ^ yours anonymously ,  ame ^ well , what do you think of that ? ? ? ^ my initial response was to regard this as a hoax , or the crazy ravings of a poor disillusioned person from  ame who has lost it somewhere . ^ however , we can never be too sure of these things . . ... ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
