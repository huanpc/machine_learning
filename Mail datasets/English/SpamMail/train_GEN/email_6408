^ assuming you are here next year and do take up the int rep role , you might find this site interesting ( although it is aimed at the uni-wide int person rather than on a college level ) : 
^ &website 
^ just clearing out my old bookmarks on my computer , so thought i 'd let you have it before i deleted it . 
^ you 'll be given an int reps guide as well as lots of really good advice at the training session first thing next term so you should be fairly well equipped . 
^ i 'll also sort out the college int rep folders over &name and let you have them first thing next term which gives you various resources . 
^ have a great &name , 
^ love
