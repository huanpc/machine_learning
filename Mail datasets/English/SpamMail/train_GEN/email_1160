" ( i hate mice ) but then went to sleep . ^ early the next morning , i was woken by the sound of the evil mouse , amplified by about  um times , in my room . ^ understandably , as i was trying to recover from my cough , and desperately needed rest , i was saddened . ^ both  ame and  ame had very smug looks on their faces that morning . ^ i am pleased to note , however , that the entire evilness of their plan did not bear fruit . ^ the plan originally involved repeatedly waking me during the night , by the use of  ame 's task manager on his computer . ^ fortunately for me , his is an incompetent oaf , and i was only woken , when  ame manually sent it off in the morning . ^ one of the fun things about fencing is that it is sometimes possible to say to your opponent , " i 'm gonna hit you on the head " and then you actually do it . ^ much more rewarding than not saying anything ! ^ i was telling  ame about this , and thought that i might worry him , by saying the " plans " i had for him ! ^ i told him that i would enter his room  um night , and squirt his face with squirty cream . ^ i even told him the night that this would be done . ^ i would say now , that at this time i had no intention of actually doing such a thing . ^ later on that evening , i was in  ame 's room with  ame , and for some reason or another , i was purifying  ame . ^ this usually involves pain , but his has grown resistant to that , so " emotional battering " was taking place . ^ this involved chucking his sterilized keys ( no kidding ) out the window into the contaminated world . ^ at this  ame flipped , and ordered me to " fetch them " . ^  ame at this time signaled for me to change my key with  ame 's, and this was the moment at which i started to think about actually getting some justice done . ^ that night , i went to bed with  ame 's key on my key ring , and mine on his . ^ as  ame is paranoid about germs entering his room at night , he always locks his door . ^ the key was needed to gain access to his room . ^ my plan was as follows , ^  har ) wait until it is late ( or early )  har ) unlock  ame 's door  har ) place my sabre on the floor , as a sign that i was there , and  har ) take a picture of  ame asleep to prove it . ^ my plan relied on the following assumptions : ^  har )  ame would not know the number inscribed on his key  har )  ame would not spend the night in  ame 's bed . ^ unfortunately , neither of these assumptions were met . ^ i know the latter one is shocking , but we need to face up to the truth . ^ my plan went well , and i returned to bed , feeling very much like  ame , after he cut the hem off of  ame 's robe when he was sleeping . ^ ( you can read about this in  um  ame ) ^ unfortunately then next morning , the following revelations were brought to light . ^  har ) both  ame and  ame had known that i was going to do something that night . ^ this , admittedly , was not surprising , as i had said that myself ! ^  har ) both  ame and  ame were awake when i took the picture of "  ame " in his bed . ^  har ) they had stolen my sabre . ^  har ) and after my shower , locked me out of my room . ^ evil people . ^  ame of the jury , i ask you to bring down fire upon these  um sinners heads , and if not that , at least water balloons . ^ thank you , and  ame  ame . ^  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  um  um  um ^  ame  har ,  ame  ame 's  ame ,  ame 's  ame ,  ame ,  ame  um ^ st.  ame 's college ^  um  ame  ame  ame dh1  ame ^ department of geological sciences university of  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
