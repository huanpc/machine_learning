^ hi &name , sorry i did n't say before that i was going home- i only knew myself friday morning when i got an email from a couple of friends who 've hired a car for the weekend and are staying in &name . 
^ when they offered to bring me home with them , i could n't refuse- i reckoned i 'd rest a lot more here than in &name ! 
^ feeling a lot better now so i think it was worth it . 
^ thanks for sorting the cards and generally doing everything this week- a " sorry to have left it to you , if there 's anything left to do just let me know ... i 'm just about to write a long-overdue letter to our prayer supporters- was meaning to do it earlier but then got ill and spare moments were taken up with postponed sup work and sleep ... take care , see you soon , love &name &name &num &num , &name &name wrote :

^ hi 
^ sorry i did n't get this e-mail until too late for risky living , so i did n't get there until shortly before it begun hence i did n't get to speak to you . 
^ anyway , you neighbour said you 'd gone home for the weekend 
^ - hope all is well - so i could n't get them signed before i wanted to get them out . 
^ therefore i hope you do n't mind , but i took the liberty of signing your name on your behalf for the remaining cards . 
^ you 've seen the bulk of the text before anyway . 
^ take care , 
^ love 
^ &name 
^ on thursday &num &name &num &num : &num , you wrote :

^ hi &name , thanks again for coming over last night with the flowers- a lovely suprise ! 
^ &name all 's well with you , do let me know if there 's anything you can pass on to me , i 'm feeling much better today , even if i ca n't quite manage to stay awake ... i do n't know whether you 'll get this in time- i will be going to risky living tonight , so if you have anything else for me to sign- or blank cards for me to start off and then give you to sign- do bring them ! 
^ think that 's all , see you soon , &name
