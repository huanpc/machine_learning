^ - why yes , naturally ! ^ " if your question is genuine , and your concerns are real ^ - of course my concerns are not genuine or real . ^  ame is quite sane as far as i am aware . ^ i am perfectly certain his statement was written in a moment of impetuous thinking . ^ "  um of the things i do n't get about guys is the way they bottle things up and do n't talk to others about things ^ - as you said , this is a generalisation , but on the whole i think you are quite correct in saying so . ^ but to whom would guys tell something like that ? ^ i presume girls would confide in a very close friend . ^ guys do n't talk about that kind of thing , generally . ^ it seems to be more difficult for us to make ourselves emotionally vulnerable . ^ how come girls have such close friendships ? ^ i mean , they quite often phone each other every day ( like  ame and  ame told me they do over the holidays ) . ^ that is quite difficult to understand . ^ guys seem to be the complete opposite they do n't seem to have the same need to communicate as frequently or intimately at all . ^ i 'm not trying to say that guys do n't have close friendships , it 's just that they seem to have a different mode of friendship , perhaps a different way of getting to the same objective . ^ but why do guys bottle things up ? ^ perhaps because they think they can cope with it themselves ? ^ perhaps because they 're not used to sharing things as much as girls may be . ^ i do n't know , but it cannot make them very happy . ^ [ re : gullibility ] " i am not . ^ that hurt . ^ - i 'm sorry  ame . ^ this confuses me . ^ sometimes i say things to you in e-mails that i think you might take offence at . ^ i am therefore am slightly worried at their reception , but they are quite often accepted as perfectly appropriate by you . ^ then i say things like the above , which i assumed you would realise was absolutely sarcastic , as i think you are generally anything but gullible . ^ it is difficult ! ^ anyway , i 'm sorry if i hurt your feelings . ^ " constantly teased you 'll insult me etc. ^ - do you really not like me teasing you ? ^ i think i do it quite often . ^ do you mind ? ^ should i try not to ? ^ " how come a till is an inanimate object , but "  ame is treated as an individual ? ^ bit of discrimination there i think . ^ - my answer is that i have never met a till with personality , whereas  ame most certainly has personality and sometimes not too nice a one either ! ^ i quote from correspondence with  ame 'she [  ame ] seems to enjoy showing a certain photo of a certain person i know , dressed in a certain white coat with a certain bottle of shampoo in his hand . ^ in fact she keeps showing it to all the people she knows i 'm beginning to wonder whether it 's a bit of an obsession . ^ suffice it to say that i sha n't regret my little excursion into  ame  ame world with  ame 's pictures after reading something like that ( ! ) ^ well  ame , it would have been nice if you had been online last night as some of us chatted for a while in the 'marshallbees chat-room . ^ in the end ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame and i turned up . ^ we talked for about an hour about various things . ^ an uninvited guest turned up , calling himself "  ame . ^ we do n't know who he was , but he was very nasty and called us names , like " elitists and " cliquey ( only he called it " clicky and  ame corrected him ) . ^  ame told him she was delighted to be an elitist if it meant she could spell correctly . ^ then we all told him to go away and learn to spell , and i told him to learn grammar too . ^ it was quite amusing , and  ame was quite rude towards him ! ^ ( by the way ,  ame says his computer automatically changes his words to what he really means to say hence the interesting combinations of letters issuing forth from his direction . ) i just hope we do n't actually know  ame "  ame . ^ it would be awful if it turned out to be someone we 'd invited to chat ! ^ so , are you okay ? ^ what have you been doing for the past few days ? ^ i 've been doing something i never thought possible . ^ i now actually enjoy organic chemistry ! ! ! ^ this is wonderful news and means that i might not fail my exams at the end of the year ! ^ i did absolutely none of it all last year ( even though it counted for a third of the course ) but have now found that it is actually quite simple and good fun ! ^ this afternoon i synthesised cocaine and opium ( on paper ) . ^ i did n't work today even though i thought i was going to be . ^ instead i am probably working tomorrow and wednesday . ^ did you get your cards made for the 3rd world shop ? ^ are they good ? ^ i think no ill of you for not being stupid enough to walk through  ame at night to post your christmas cards . </text_normal></message_body></message>
