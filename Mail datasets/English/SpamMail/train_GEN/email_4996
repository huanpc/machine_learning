^ hi dr. &name , 
^ my name is &name &name - we met very briefly at sigmod last june ( at your demo session ) . 
^ i am currently trying to decide where i want to to a phd - i have been accepted at &name , &org , and &name . 
^ i am having great difficulty making this decision , as all &num are great schools . 
^ people from &org and &name told me that you interviewed there , and i know you went to &org as an undergrad and &name as a grad . 
^ as a &name person , the database community at &name and &org would look a lot more appealing to me if you ended up going there ( there is no real community at &org right now , and if you joined &name and &name at &name , that department would be significantly improved ) . 
^ i know you are still going through interviews and have no idea where you will end up , but i was wondering if you had any initial preferences going in ( especially now after you spent the day at &name ) and what you think might be the general likelyhood of going to one of those &num schools should they both give you an offer . 
^ i know this is a very difficult / awkward question to answer , so if you ca n't answer it , i understand . 
^ anyway , if you have any other views of &name vs. &org for grad school , let me know &smiley 
^ thanks , &name
