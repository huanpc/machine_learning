^ hi &name , 
^ taking a bit of inspiration from your suggestion i did the following with success : 
^ &num . 
^ copied application off disk &num and all good data files onto &char : drive in an empty file ; &num . 
^ ran &name disk doctor over only file areas of disk &num , repairing what could be ; &num . 
^ saved recovered file from &char : to &char : &num . 
^ ran application file on &char : 
^ seems to have got all my data back although an error message says some was lost . 
^ &name , the files were mainly &name &num and &name &num stuff . 
^ if someone else reports same problem , trust this might work for them too .

^ i 've been using &name maker for a year or so but have recently come up with a problem on disk &num of a &num disk spanned archieve due to bad disk sectors . 
^ i 've attempted to repair the disk with scandisk on &name me without luck and the files wo n't extract without the last disk . 
^ is there any way i can extract the data that is good on the other &num disks ?

^ &name the last disk is the most critical one as it contains a lot of the information required for processing the archive . 
^ you could try to copy all the fragments ( which you can read ) into &num directory on the hard drive , bring up a command-prompt and use the command &website ( obviously replacing ... with all the other files and filename with the actual name of the file ) . 
^ then try using &name or &name to attempt to &website . 
^ it probably wo n't work , but it might be worth a try . 
^ sorry i ca n't be of more help . 
^ yours , 
^ &name &name &name &name &name 
^ &name &name : &name , free & easy for file sharing &website 
^ - &name &name & fingerprint - &website aaa8 95a1 cc07 &name &name &name &name &name &name 5d3f
