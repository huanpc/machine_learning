^ hey mate , 
^ how 's things ? 
^ i 'm really tired out having spent the last few weeks being very busy , but im closer to the &name holidays now ! 
^ i might have to get a job but atleast it will be a change and therefore a break of sorts ! 
^ i need the money because i broke my mobile phone ! 
^ how wierd is it that &num or so years ago i did n't have a mobile phone and did n't ever really need one ! 
^ now though , it has become my lifeline and i have had to replace it ! 
^ not that i 'm really complaining because i am about to get a really nice new &name phone , but it is nevertheless a phone that i ca n't afford ! 
^ the other &num was cutting out all the time and seemed to never charge up any more . 
^ &num day , i got a bit annoyed as it turned off when i was talkign to &name so i threw it against an amp ! 
^ i do n't think it liked that much ! 
^ anyway , i 'll let you have my new number when i know it ! 
^ are you staying in &name for &name ? 
^ i hope you are giving yourself a bit of a break ! 
^ how 's all the work going ? 
^ have you played any more football / hockey ? 
^ have you heard the eurovision song ? 
^ i actually have n't heard it yet but it was written by one of my tutors ! 
^ i bet he 's gonna a make a fair bit of money out of that ! 
^ &name things are well anyway mate , &name
