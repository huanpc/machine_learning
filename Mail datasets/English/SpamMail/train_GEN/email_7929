^ dear &name &name , 
^ i have suffered yet another defeat at the hands of the bank of &name &name banking service and find that i have to pester you again to make this money transfer thing happen . 
^ sorry ! 
^ what they said today is i need &num things : 
^ &name : &num ( all present and correct ) 
^ account no. : please write it down for me again . 
^ it has &num digits . 
^ reference no : which may be up to &num characters 
^ this is really bugging me now because you 'd think that it should be so easy and it 's obviously proving not to be ! 
^ it would also help , i think if they knew what kind of egg account it was ( &name etc ) because they ask me things i do n't know . 
^ the &num numbers will do the trick though , i 'm told . 
^ going to &name 's dad 's funeral today so i 've heaps to do as i 'm going out to school after it to pick up the mound of marking that 's left on my desk . 
^ do n't see why it was left for me to mark when someone else was paid to set and oversee the work but them 's the breaks . 
^ must make a start ! 
^ heaps of love , 
^ mam xx 
^ get your free download of &name explorer at &website
