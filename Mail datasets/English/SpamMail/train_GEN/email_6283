^ hi &name , 
^ how are you ? 
^ how was &name and whatever else you 've been up to since ? 
^ thanks for your postcard - i 'm sorry it 's taken me aaages to reply . 
^ i 'm back at work now and it went really well this week &smiley i 'm feeling a lot more like i know what i 'm aiming for now , whereas before it was more 'do this for a few days to get the hang of it and learn some computing . ... " . 
^ now i have a code all of my own that models particle trajectories in a spinning magnetic dipole field , with associated magnetic field , like you get rould a pulsar ( apparently . ... ) . 
^ it 's really cool , it 's all position- and time-dependent and can iterate and includes special relativity and all sorts of exciting things ! 
^ &name , sorry . 
^ anyway , my supervisor seems to be quite pleased as he said today " now i know that you work hard i wo n't have to look for a summer student next year if you want to come back " , which i think works out as a good thing ! 
^ so it looks like i 'll be back at &name next year , hopefully understanding a bit more physics and without having completely forgotten everything i ever knew about computers . ... hmm . ... 
^ what have you been up to then ? 
^ &name sounds good ; i hope the weather was ok for camping ! 
^ i was youth hostelling in &name with my brother for a few days , which was good but not quite as planned ! 
^ we spent less time walking and more time waiting for buses than i 'd have liked , but never mind . 
^ the weather was n't great either - really foggy , so so much for the beautiful cornish caost views ! 
^ it 's probably better than walking in really hot weather though i guess . 
^ we came home a day early in the end and stayed with my grandparents in &name , as we were meeting up with my parents there the next evening anyway . 
^ in the end that turned out really well and we had a lovely time with them . 
^ they 're amazing : we took them up a tor ( hill with rocks ( granite , of course :- ) ) on top if you 're not in the know ! ) and they still wanted to play tennis afterwards ! 
^ did n't ask how their joints felt the next day though . ... oops . 
^ anyway , it 's been a lovely summer but i feel like it 's nearly the end now . 
^ do you have stuff to do before term starts work-wise ? 
^ i did n't have any which makes me feel like i 've missed something somewhere ! 
^ i 'm going to be really good at vector calculus next term though - i spent yesterday morning finding the curl of the curl of some nasty expression , which gave the time-dependent magnetic field around the pulsar . 
^ i think i got it right in the end . . ... 
^ see you soon , and enjoy the rest of the summer !
