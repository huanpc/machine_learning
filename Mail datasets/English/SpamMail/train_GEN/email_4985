^ &name ! 
^ your email had me laughig so hard , i was getting rude looks from everyone else in the computer laboratory ! 
^ the thought of an email suck in a space time continuum is just too much &smiley 
^ was the email you sent large in size ? 
^ or was it a regular text email ? 
^ given that i have never met &name , i ca n't compare this &name girl with him . 
^ but if she is as evil as &name , she certainly hid that well . 
^ anyway , let me know what you think about meeting up with them , i does n't matter to me either way . 
^ i had to give a presentation in one of the classes i am taking today . 
^ &name is , one of my group members ( the one who was supposed to bring the slides ) did n't show . 
^ what a disaster ! 
^ what made it worse was that i had never actually seen the slides - the plan was to just organize my presentation around the contents of the slides , on the fly . 
^ so without the slides , my talk was so terrible , the professor actually interrupted me mid-talk and took over . 
^ quite embarassing . 
^ but at least i 'll get a free drink out of it ( the group member who flaked definitely owes me a drink ) . 
^ anyway , &num for hours from now i will be on a plane to the &name ! 
^ i ca n't believe how fast this term has flown by &smiley

^ forwarded warning as you wish ! 
^ it scares me a bit . 
^ too serious for my taste . 
^ apparently your mailbox is actually full ! 
^ i could n't even fwd . 
^ the old email because it does n't show up in my 'sent mail " folder . 
^ this means that my email is stuck somewhere between the transitory time and space continuum . 
^ if you dare venture out there you can only see it at dusk betwixt it 's continuous planetary rotation . 
^ &char really need to eat . 
^ mmmm .. sooooo hungry . ... &name you 're having fun in class ! 
^ ; &char &name
