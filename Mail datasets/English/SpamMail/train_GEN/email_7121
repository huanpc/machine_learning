^ hi &name , thanks again for coming over last night with the flowers- a lovely suprise ! 
^ &name all 's well with you , do let me know if there 's anything you can pass on to me , i 'm feeling much better today , even if i ca n't quite manage to stay awake ... 
^ i do n't know whether you 'll get this in time- i will be going to risky living tonight , so if you have anything else for me to sign- or blank cards for me to start off and then give you to sign- do bring them ! 
^ think that 's all , see you soon , &name
