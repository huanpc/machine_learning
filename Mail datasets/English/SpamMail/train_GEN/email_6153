^ thanks for that advice , i 'll keep it in mind , but i have now almost finished packing and i have filled up about &num big big bags so i am not sure whether i 'll find room for a pillow ! ! ! 
^ by the way i have another question , but do n't worry it really should be the last one this time ! 
^ i was wondering if it is complicated to have friends staying for the week end in the college with us or not . 
^ &name i have a friend i have n't seen for years who 's told me he was gonna come on the 11th of october and it is stressing me out as i have no idea how all that works , and also because i think it is too early as i would just start to know people . 
^ i am asking you that because &char read that we were allowed to have guests only &num nights each year , and i was wondering it is was just to let us know that it was n't a hotel or if they really check . 
^ &name now that 's it for my little problem i will really let you enjoy the end of your holidays ! ! 
^ see you soon &name 
^ chat with friends online , try &name &name : &website
