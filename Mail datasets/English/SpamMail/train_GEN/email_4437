^ we had a couple of days of snow , but not as much as you by the sounds of it . 
^ i did spend &num evening making snowmen on &name college lawn though ! ! 
^ my term is going pretty well - i got &num &char 's in my first set of exams , so i 've made a positive start ! 
^ i 'm off home this weekend , to see &name ( house party speaker .. ? ) who is staying at my house with his wife for a couple of nights . 
^ i 've also bought a pair of rollerblads which were delivered to my house , so i 'm going to pick them up - i 'll be like a 14-year-old again ! !

^ just a line to let you down there in &name &name know what 's going on here in chilly &name . 
^ it did n't snow last night for the first time in days - and the ice is now melting , so it 's possible that it might get a little warmer fairly soon ... ! 
^ i 'm now in the middle of trying to work out what i can write my second essay on . 
^ i 've narrowed it down to english religious cults or the rise of the &name dynasty in &name - but of course that 's quite a large range of subjects and i need to narrow it down quite a bit before handing the essay in at the start of next term . 
^ still - the first essay was basically written in &num weeks over the christmas holiday ( although i 've no idea how i 've done yet ! ) so i 've still got plenty of time . 
^ life seems to be going well , apart from the fact that i 've got no money at all ! 
^ we 've nearly got a house sorted for next year - we just need to sign the contract . 
^ and i 've got to persuade my parents to take all the stuff from &num house to the other , which is on the other side of town . 
^ no doubt i 'll manage somehow . 
^ still - life can be hard at times ! 
^ enjoy life down there where you are and feel free to visit at any cheers &name
