^ &name ... again . 
^ trying to avoid studying sociology so i 'll email you . 
^ it 's that boring . 
^ yes ... yes it is . 
^ i will be adding this phrase to my everyday coversation . 
^ it 's too funny . 
^ &name and me saw &name in cars with boys , with &name &name . 
^ except when i asked for my ticket i said just riding with boys . 
^ good een . 
^ but i do n't think they use that phrase quite the way we do so she did n't really notice . 
^ &name . 
^ anyway , it was pretty good . 
^ some of it was hilarious but other bits were quite depressing . 
^ which sucks when i thought i was just seeing a comedy . 
^ and the ending was quite shit . 
^ so i would say wait for the rental . 
^ ca n't believe &name 's out already . 
^ although since it 's an english author i suppose that 's how it should be . 
^ only fair . 
^ but still . 
^ i 'm too impatient . 
^ &name maybe ca n't manage to see it the weekend it comes out anyway but in htat case i will go myself . 
^ i do n't care about being a loner when &name 's involved . 
^ although i was thinking of going up to &name to see &name and &name that weekend and &name also loves &name . 
^ but i ca n't afford it , time or money-wise . 
^ so when 's &name of the rings out ? 
^ &name , &name . 
^ mmmm. 
^ my &name was confiscated on the friday night but on saturday &name got me an old one of her mate 's . 
^ at &name though ( where i was too short ) they did n't take it off me , they just said they could n't let me in. &num think they just wanted to keep me out of their place so they would n't get into shit but they did n't care about anywhere else . 
^ but none of us were &name 'd at the gay club so it would n't have mattered anyway . 
^ well , until the next time but hey , never mind . 
^ well , wednesday night will be the next time cuz &name got us tickets to see &name . 
^ i 've never heard of them but she says they 're pretty good . 
^ only thing is , it 's at the wave , the club at the uni community centre , so i can get in as long a &char i show my wet / dry card , which tells them i 'm underage and i think i get a wristband so that the bar staff know not to serve me booze . 
^ &name . 
^ although it 's a weekday so i 'm not actually that bothered . 
^ i 'm on a bit of a health kick anyway . 
^ booze too many calories &char &name . 
^ oh , for mam 's &name . 
^ i remember her saying ages ago that she loved &name expectations ( the new one with gwyneth) . 
^ i know she does n't like &name but she said she loved &name &name in it . 
^ i 've never been able to find it in &name , just the old one , and obviously it 's no use buying it here , but maybe you could have a scan around you . 
^ either that or &name &name and the last &name . 
^ &name and &name in the same film . 
^ &name , heaven . 
^ and mam likes them as well , obviously . 
^ ok , will go and surf for pointless websites . 
^ &name fun . 
^ &name luv , &name xx
