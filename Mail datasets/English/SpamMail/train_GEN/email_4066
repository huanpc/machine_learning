^ hi there peops ! ! 
^ hope you 've all had a wonderful , if not so white christmas . 
^ it 's great to be back home and get spoilt for a while ( although not for long ... ! ) and enjoy all the home comforts ( like carpets ) that you miss from being away . 
^ now as you probably guessed , my main reason for emailing is to say that the new year 's party is still very much on . 
^ and i ca n't wait to see you all soon . 
^ if you did n't know already , &name and &name are coming now , rather than driving over afterwards , which is fantastic news ! ! 
^ and &name , i did n't know if you 're coming or not , be great if you could . 
^ could everyone bring drinks and crisps etc ? 
^ ( i 'm sure you will anyway , but i just thought i 'd ask .. ! ) and i 'll provide the rest of the food . 
^ maybe if &name and &name could do puddings- do n't worry about buying any ingredients , we 'll go to the shops when &char pick you up from the station . 
^ as for getting here , most of you know &char live in the middle of nowhere . 
^ so if you 're getting a train , go to either &name &name &name or &name station and i 'll come and pick you up . 
^ as for drivers , here come my fantastic directions ... ! ! 
^ on the &name , about &num miles past last &name exit , turn off down the slip road to &name &name of slip road , turn right and follow to cross roads go straight across , so " the &name " pub is on the left follow bendy road &num miles and when you come to &num limits , down a hill , take right turn at the bottom past &name church and red phone box on left , keep going another mile or so until you come to &name phone box on your right - turn left here this is our road ( &name road ) keep going til you come out of &num limits and " high acres " is the first house on the right , with the balloon ( there will be one ! ! ) 
^ &name that 's all understandable ! 
^ it 's not really that complicated ... ! ! 
^ if we say to come from 4pm onwards then you can get here before dark if you 'd like to . 
^ i think that 's everything ! 
^ my home number is &num &num and mobile is &num see you all very soon ! 
^ love kt &char
