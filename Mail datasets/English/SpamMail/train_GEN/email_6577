^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : unchecked buffer in &name &name handler can run code of &name 's choice ( q323889 ) released : &num june &num &name : &num june &num ( version &num ) &name : &name explorer , &name &name , &name &name and &name &name &name : run code of &name 's choice &name &name : critical bulletin : ms02-027 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ reason for &name : 
^ on june &num , &num , &name released the original version of this bulletin . 
^ in it , we detailed a work-around procedure that customers could implement to protect themselves against a publicly disclosed vulnerability . 
^ an updated version of this bulletin was rereleased on june &num , &num to announce the availability of patches for proxy server &num and &name &name &num and to advise customers that the work-around procedure is no longer needed on those platforms . 
^ patches for &name are forthcoming and this bulletin will be re-released to announce their availability . 
^ &name : 
^ this is a work-around bulletin that details steps customers can take to protect themselves against a publicly disclosed vulnerability until patches are available . 
^ the &name protocol is a legacy protocol that provides for the transfer of text-based information across the &name . 
^ information on &name servers is hierarchically presented using a menu system , and multiple &name servers can be linked together to form a collective " &name " . 
^ there is an unchecked buffer in a piece of code which handles the response from &name servers . 
^ this code is used independently in &name , &name , and proxy server . 
^ a security vulnerability results because it is possible for an attacker to attempt to exploit this flaw by mounting a buffer overrun attack through a specially crafted server response . 
^ the attacker could seek to exploit the vulnerability by crafting a web page that contacted a server under the attacker 's control . 
^ the attacker could then either post this page on a web site or send it as an &name email . 
^ when the page was displayed and the server 's response received and processed , the attack would be carried out . 
^ &char successful attack requires that the attacker be able to send information to the intended target using the &name protocol . 
^ anything which inhibited &name connectivity could protect against attempts to exploit this vulnerability . 
^ in the case of &name , the code would be run in the user 's context . 
^ as a result , any limitations on the user would apply to the attacker 's code as well . 
^ mitigating factors : 
^ - a successful attack requires that the attacker 's server be able to deliver information to the target using the &name protocol . 
^ customers who block &name at the perimeter would be protected against attempts to exploit this vulnerability across the &name . 
^ - in the case of &name , code would run in the security context of the user . 
^ as a result , any limitations on the user 's ability would also restrict the actions an attacker 's code could take . 
^ - a successful attack against &name and proxy servers would require that the malicious response be received by the web proxy service . 
^ in practical terms , this means that a proxy client would have to submit the initial request through the proxy server . 
^ &name &name : 
^ - &name systems : critical 
^ - &name systems : critical 
^ - client systems : critical 
^ &name availability : 
^ - a patch is currently under development to fix this vulnerability . 
^ please read the security bulletin at &website for workaround information while patches are developed .
