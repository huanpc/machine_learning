^ hi &name , 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i look forward to hearing about what happened in &name . 
^ it sounds very exciting ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ oh it was such a blessing ! 
^ there 's so much to tell ( do n't worry i sha n't go on too long ) , firstly it was so good to see what had been done on the building and with the people since last year . 
^ that was encouraging . 
^ we met some new friends and got better aquainted with old &num . 
^ we worked with &name 's strength behind us . 
^ &name abounds . 
^ still , for me i have to say that i went to &name because i was bored . 
^ i was n't even planning to go but they had a spare place so i did , for something to do . 
^ and i thought , after last year , that perhaps i could do with spurring on somehow in my faith . 
^ i 've totally given up on myself this last year . 
^ not on &name , i know he is faithful see . 
^ but i knew that i 'd made so many promises to follow him again - " this time &name , i will do your will , i will pray , i wo n't be lazy " . 
^ and every time it did n't happen . 
^ for a year . 
^ so i told &name , look i wo n't try anymore because i do n't want to insult you with promises i know i ca n't keep . 
^ and i gave up . 
^ now , &name really helped me during the week . 
^ but it was still all the same as before . 
^ and on the last day we were there , the sunday , we had a joint english / polish service ans my friend &name gave her testimony and others etc. and i was sitting down when my polish friend &name sang a song in polish and thinking " i 've been so unhappy this last year ! " 
^ so while i was there i thought some things , in these words pretty much . 
^ and the thought went like this : " well &name . 
^ we can do this &num ways . 
^ there 's the first way , and that 's the easy way . 
^ you can make a decision now to follow me and be happy . 
^ and it wo n't be really easy but i want you to do it . 
^ or there 's the second way , the hard way . 
^ you can carry on as you are doing , running away and be miserable indefinitely and i shall have to follow you to the ends of the earth and drag you back , kicking , by the hair , which i will do . 
^ we can do it this way if you want ! " 
^ and i thought : &name okay . 
^ well , what do i do about it ? 
^ do i stand up and say this now ? 
^ shall i ? 
^ shall i ? 
^ please give me a sign ! 
^ nothing happend . 
^ and i did n't do anything publicly . 
^ but i thought : i 've got a decision to make ! 
^ whom shall i tell ? ! 
^ and i thought about telling &name , and then i thought about telling the pastor . 
^ and in the end i did n't. 
^ after lunch we were going to a village church plant somewhere and doing some english stuff there , so i asked &name if i could say something and i was really thinking about it and thought about psalm &num - you know , " where can i hid from your love ... etc etc " about &name following you everywhere . 
^ and i really was n't sure . 
^ so anyway , we went to the service and all the polish songs were about &name seeking us and being faithful and calling us . 
^ then the reading was psalm &num . 
^ i thought , okay &name - i wanted a sign , i got a big kick in the seat of the pants . 
^ that 'll do ! 
^ so instead of &name i stood up and said all of this , with &name &name translating and &num thought " i do n't know how to end this ! " so i just said " what can i do ? 
^ what shall i do ? 
^ i 'm going to have to choose the easy way because i do n't want to be dragged anywhere by the hair ! " . 
^ and really , really this was not a conversion moment ! 
^ at all ! 
^ not in my mind . 
^ my view of &name has n't changed , i 've always , always know that he is faithful and almighty . 
^ what i had done was made a decision , not a promise ( promises break and then you do n't have to do them anymore , decisions you must stick to even after you screw up ) , to make an effort for &name and pray and study and there was no emotion . 
^ love , for me at least ( i 've never been " in love " so i ca n't tell what the feeling would be anyway ) , is not a feeling but a decision to act as &name wants . 
^ so i sat down and the whole room ( a tiny , wooden room in a tiny farm in a tiny hamlet in the middle of nowhere ! ) was crying , and i got hugged by everyone , even the polish farmers and the english ex meat inspector . 
^ and i got prayed for ( in &num languages ) . 
^ and i felt no emotion at all , but i 'm glad i said something because i ca n't let these people down now ! 
^ also , i got given cake . 
^ my friend &name who stood up and preached on &name &num &num said i 'd saved him half his sermon ... 
^ it 's funny how &name works , in rustic surroundings in rustic people , in all of our lives , so funny it is . 
^ i think he likes to be dramatic . 
^ i am so sorry , i haven;t said much about &name ! 
^ but i wanted to tell someone else what happened , who wasnt there . 
^ i hope that was n't too long . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ one of the things that i am thinking a lot about now is " how much do i want to earn ? " which is a really weird question . 
^ but it really is n't, because i am trying to work out how important a good job is for me , over how much money i want to earn . 
^ humm . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i do n't think it 's weird at all ! 
^ i 'd much rather have a low paid job where i could be &name &name than lots of money and be as stressed as my dad . 
^ the problem is with jobs that you enjoy is that they start out like that and then you get promoted and paid more to do a job you 're not trained for and do n't enjoy . 
^ so think carefully ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i hope &name is good . 
^ sounds very exciting . 
^ i am thinking about doing a volcanology phd at the moment , but i do n't know really . 
^ we will see what happens , as i still do n't know if the place has been filled or not . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ hey , you ca n't do that ! 
^ that 's my field ! 
^ i 've discovered that the volcano observatory in &name does volunteerships for a minimum of &num months which does n't get you any money ( and you have to pay your way food wise etc ) but may get you a project and definitely gets you cool work experience . 
^ also , they 're desperate for people with / doing actual degrees in geology to do digital mapping of recent lava flows - look them up on 
^ &website 
^ it 's a thought at least , although perhaps you need a more stable kind of actual qualification thing . 
^ anyway , the phd sounds cool , where 's it based ? 
^ do n't say &name ! 
^ would you ever consider working with &name &name ? 
^ although i guess if you 're going to be a christian example to your colleagues then you could n't find a more needful subject ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ it sounds like &name has been very sticky to you recently . 
^ &name old &name ! 
^ i am trying to work through proverbs at the moment , and there is a lot to learn from that ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name yes , by definition ! 
^ i think the last chapter is the best , although for obvious reasons ( look it up ) it probably wo n't do much for you . 
^ unless you have misled ideas of a womans place in the world that need to be corrected of course ! 
^ i 've been reading &name . 
^ it is really quite mind boggling ! 
^ all the things about &num headed angels and wheels covered in eyes . 
^ it makes you think " is that really what heaven is like ? ! ! ! ! ! " but i 'm sure , though &name is terrifying , he is n't freaky scary . 
^ it 's really challenging ( i 'm reading it along with some bible notes ) , it really forces you to think about where your priorities are and what exactly you place more important than &name . 
^ it 's going to be really hard working through it all , and it makes me so aware of exactly how much i need to change ( completely ) to even start to work towards what &name desires . 
^ happily , i 'm not living in old testament times and i have joy because &name has died for all the faliures i 'm going to make along the way and all the failings i have that i do n't even realise yet . 
^ there really is no hope at all for me without &name ! 
^ i was reading all the prophesis about the death of all &name and how repulsive we all are in &name 's sight because of what we have done and the idolatry we 've commited while listening to some modern worship songs . 
^ some of them seem really inappropriate in juxtaposition with &name 's words to &name : too self satisfied and comfortable . 
^ the problem i 'm finding with reading the &name at the moment is that i 'm so overwhelmed with things to learn and remember and take in. &num feel so swamped that i 'll never understand and remember and put it all into use . 
^ that looks really silly having written that . 
^ of course i 'm never going to ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ my brother &name and i are going for a big long trip around north &name for &num weeks , which should be great fun . 
^ i am looking forward to that , although i would love to have a clue about what is going to happen next year . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name &num vs &num 'do n't worry about anything , but in all your prayers ask &name for what you need , always asking him with a thankful heart . 
^ and &name 's peace , which is far beyond all human understanding , will keep your hearts and minds safe in union with &name &name . " 
^ and when you do find out what you 're going to do i 'm sure it 'll be very exciting ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ have you been watching the games on tv ? 
^ my brother has had it on the whole time , so i am feeling very much sported out ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ no , i 've been jetting around the world and in &name . 
^ i 've got &name 's palmtop pc with me now for &num weeks ! ! 
^ &name ! 
^ it 's so cool ! 
^ i 'm even keeping all my notes in it , so the only notebooks i need are for sketching ! 
^ i really should apologise for taking up all your time to read this marathon of an email , hope your trip goes well , 
^ bon voyage 
^ &name .
