<text_normal> 

^ 
^ * * if you 're being serious- and i can never tell- i 'm sorry . 
</text_normal>

^ this is another generalised email to clog your inbox and generally annoy you by not being personalised in any way . 
^ would i be being very sad to admit that it 's actually the first email i 've received since leaving &name ? 
^ i thought so . 
^ * * no. it 's the first i 've recieved , and that 's only because i 'm accidentally on my own mailing list . 
^ and incidentally , do &name and &name never check their email ? 
^ ( for all the comp boffs that they are ... ) 
^ the sight of talking chickens amused me 
^ &name ! 
^ that 's a healthy sign . 
^ now tell me , what do you think of singing sheep ? 
^ &name ! 
^ we 'll get along like a house on fire next year !

^ 
^ * * hmmm . 
^ house+fire usually damaged clothes . 
^ not convinced .

^ hopefully something disastrous will happen in the next few weeks so you wo n't all have to read these dull emails . 
^ thanks for the quote . 
^ i hope you 're all well ... to those of you lucky enough to be jaunting off to foreign places , send me a postcard . 
^ yes , i 'm well . 
^ just a little bored . 
^ yes , i 'll send a postcard . 
^ so , do you like chicken ? 
^ as a food , i mean . 
^ i see . 
^ &name . 
^ me too . 
^ yes , well , most people say that , do n't they ! 
^ &name . 
^ this is a great conversation . 
^ i agree with everything you say ! 
^ &name may it continue . 
^ you may be interested , but probably wo n't be , to know that i am practising cooking for the flat . 
^ no disasters yet , as such . 
^ now , would you like me to paint your room bright pink with green dots , or black with blue and white interlacing octagons , when i 'm down at the flat in a few weeks time ? 
^ i thought so . 
^ see you . 
^ i have run out of words to write down , as i 've just written &num in an email to someone else . 
^ &name [ in ] 
^ * * hmmm . 
^ the interlacing octagons sound ... interesting . 
^ have fun . 
^ and then i 'll have fun slowly torturing you to death if you 've messed up my room in any way at all . 
^ you see , i want it plain white so that the mess shows up nice and clearly against the walls ... 
^ just kidding . 
^ glad to hear about the cooking ; now there 's &num of us who can cook ( do n't trust &name and &name 's cooking , do n't trust &name 's methods of cooking , tend to be of the " what 's this ? 
^ how interesting ! 
^ i 'll put that in , then " variety ) . 
^ have signed up with several job agencies in desperate search of work . 
^ the grimace that they all give when i reply " i 'm studying english lit " does not give me confidence for post-uni time and reinforces the message behind that joke " what do you say to an arts graduate ? 
^ big &name and fries please " . 
^ my sister ( &name [ toria ] ) is moping about the house after her a levels saying " i 'll never get to &name with the amount of revision i 've done " . 
^ unfortunately this is probably true , and she 'll end up at &name 's ( her 2nd choice ) . 
^ &name ! 
^ woe , woe , thrice woe . 
^ but smile because &name loves you ! 
^ until we email again , au revoir ! 
^ love &name ps thanks again for doing those photos for me . 
^ i really appreciate it . 
^ get your private , free e-mail from &name &name at &website
