^ i am looking at the july &num document that you sent to the zippers list on july &num to present at the july &num meeting ( that was the meeting where we finally agreed on these operators ) . 
^ i have not received any written document from you sice then , but maybe you have been revising the operators since then in private emails to &name or &name .

^ i think the version of slide you were just talking to me about is different from the writeup of slide that i am looking at ( i believe that this is the latest written verseion that i have received ) . 
^ in this writeup , you have a parameter called tuplimit that counts the number of tuples that contributed to a state , and if tuplimit is reached then this is the default close . 
^ obviously , this makes slide &char &num different from tumble ( although this could be implemented in tumble using the unless satisfies clause ) . 
^ is there a more recent written version somewhere that has the default stop for slide being that the value of the group-by attributes being outside the windowrange ?
