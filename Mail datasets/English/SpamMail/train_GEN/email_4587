^ you just love engineering do n't you &name . 
^ you 're vastly over-exaggerating again - it was only &num squillion at last count . 
^ i will definitely be away at the end of august with my family ( probably the last week in &name ) . 
^ other than that , my course finishes at the end of july , and the other few squillion holidays are not yet fixed , but they are probably all quite flexible . 
^ i hope this gives you some more delightful data to ponder over in your quest for work-avoidance .

^ &name , if &char remember correctly , you were last planning to go on about &num squillion holidays this summer . 
^ do you know when they all are or roughly might be ? 
^ i 'm just thinking about semi-epic bike ride action and if it might work out . 
^ well , to tell you the truth , i 'm thinking about everything but what i 'm supposed to be doing ( which is work ) . 
^ hope yours is going well
