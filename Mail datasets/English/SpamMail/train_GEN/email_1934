" and 'do you have to sign a form to become a christian ? " joking aside though , i enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . ^ consequently i enjoyed a much more respectable  um or  um hours sleep each night . ^ did i tell you yesterday that i was going to a concert in the evening ? ^ it was brilliant . ^ the  ame  ame philharmonic orchestra was playing - quite unusual for  ame ! ^ this afternoon i 've been with my family to  ame - a nearby country house . ^ it is very warm today and i like it . ^ we had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . ^ tomorrow morning i begin my new job for  um weeks . ^ i will be working from  um o' clock until  um in the lab , and i am quite looking forward to it although i hope it will not be too biring . ^ i hope your camp in  um weeks goes well . ^ where is it ? ^ very best wishes , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
