^ hi &name , 
^ the &name web-site sounds an excellent idea . 
^ unfortunately i do not know how to make a web-site , although i am registered for &name of free web space on &website . 
^ anyway , you know the way you can make &name programmes on your computer ? 
^ well , i am very keen to learn &name programming . 
^ so , i was wondering if you could tell me the name of the software i would need to buy in order to pursue this ambition . 
^ &name telephoned me last night and asked me to come punting on the river on the 17th / 18th of september . 
^ i said i would . 
^ he also suggested that we have our pre-flat meeting then . 
^ what do you think ? 
^ also , we spoke about paying for communal food ( evening meals etc. ) and bills . 
^ we both concluded that it would be great if we could have a flat bank account which provided us each with a switch card so that shopping / bills could be paid easily and hygienically . 
^ then each of us could contribute a small amount , each month say , to the flat account . 
^ what do you think ? 
^ it would save us having do get confused with receipts and bits and pieces of bills here and there paid by different people if everything could just go in and out of &num simple account . 
^ ( as you can see i am sold on the idea ! 
^ i love keeping bank accounts ! ) i have already enquired at a few banks and certainly they supply a few cards , but i will have to see if they supply &num . 
^ it might not be necessary to have &num anyway . 
^ this type of account has no charges . 
^ anyway , that is something for you to &name over . 
^ let me know . 
^ so , i do not exactly have a job , but i am working &num day a week in a christian book shop in &name , our local town . 
^ ( my dad is the manager of it ) i get paid , so it is always something . 
^ well , take care . 
^ &name 
^ &name &name seems quite keen on having a flat web-site cunning ! 
^ &name i enclose some photos of the flat !
