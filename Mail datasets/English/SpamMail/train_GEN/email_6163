^ ok - do you want to buy the copy yourself then ? 
^ &name has reserved the edtn in my name , so you 'll need to ask for it when you get to &name &name . 
^ i 'm sure he said it was at &pound; &num - anyway , he has checked that this one is the right edtn ! 
^ thanks , &name .

^ to : &name &name ( &name ) &name : &name &name ( co-organiser / choral fixer / &name &name ) &name &name ( treasurer ) 
^ thanks for your e-mail and the information . 
^ &name is looking in the &name 's library , but holds out little hope . 
^ therefore my proposal is as follows ( which &name has seconded ) . 
^ i suggest that we purchase the copy from &name &name as we 'll have this problem again next year ( and the year after .. ) . 
^ i shall buy it and if funds allow within the &name budget then &name can buy it off me . 
^ otherwise it 'll remain my property until the end of our time here at which point i 'll donate it to &name if they intend to continue the &name concerts .

^ &name and &name 
^ just to let you know , as spoke to &name last night , we are still &num conductor 's score short , which we cannot find anywhere from the library . 
^ &name &name has found a copy for &pound; &num from &name &name shop . 
^ are we prepared : 
^ &name to buy it using the &name account 
^ &name to say that he has to buy it himself 
^ &name to offer half / half - so we would pay , say , &pound; &num , and him pay the rest and allow him to keep it . 
^ &name in mind i have spent so far : 
^ &pound; &num on scores &pound; approx &num on vocal scores 
^ i have sent this request to &name &name , and this is a copy of that message . 
^ thanks , &name
