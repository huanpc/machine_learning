^ hey &name ! 
^ " i regret to inform you that i now have only &num leg , as the other &num was infested by a deadly fungus during my brief swim in the communal pool this weekend and unfortunately had to be amputated . 
^ but hey , i guess one takes these risks if one insists on undertaking such dangerous occupations as communal swimming . " - not funny - i believed you initially . 
^ " talking of frontiers , i watched the final &num episodes of voyager the other day - are those really the last &num episodes ? ? ? 
^ i can hardly believe it . 
^ not a bad way to end i guess - at least i got to see the &name queen . 
^ &name on , was n't it you who had the hots for the &name queen ? ? " - do n't be ridiculous , i have much more taste than that . 
^ it is folly to try and rewrite history . 
^ hope you 're having an interesting week . 
^ i am . 
^ &name
