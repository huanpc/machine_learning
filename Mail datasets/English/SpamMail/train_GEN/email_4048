^ thanks to you all for such an enjoyable season , we will have to wait a while until we know where we ended up in the league table but i will let you know when i do . 
^ we will continue practice on tuesdays as long as the turnout is good , if not we will stop and then practice once before our friendly with &name at the end of term . 
^ apart from that , i hope you 've got your &name &name tickets and i 'd just like to say that i have felt very honoured to have been captain this season and i wish &name 's many more successful years to come . 
^ yours , &name
