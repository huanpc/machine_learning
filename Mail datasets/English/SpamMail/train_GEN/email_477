^ hi &name ! 
^ &name is conspiring behind my back with &name , &name , &name , &name and all the other &name server things . 
^ this is weird ! 
^ i 've been " experimenting " with checking my email via netscape from &name here at home . 
^ i 've just logged on , and now suddenly hundreds of weird-looking folders are appearing in my directories . 
^ the entire contents of my j-drive are here ~20mb , along with lots of other stuff , pine , altair , &name , deneb , i 'm confused ! 
^ i 've also got an e-mail from the its helpdesk informing me that my application for a new account was successful - i 've asked for no such thing ! 
^ apart from that , i 'm having not too bad a day . 
^ i got my j-drive space doubled to &name at the its helpdesk , and i got a first from my inorganic labs . 
^ see you soon , 
^ &name
