^ would &name be possible on sunday ? 
^ if you 'd rather make it &name as to avoid breaking up your afternoon , i 'll do my best , but &num would be somewhat easier ! 
^ i 'd be very grateful if you were able to drive me and the monitor back to &name afterwards ; i 'll try to arrange for the gates into &name &name ( off &name street , on the left if you 've just come off &name &name 's street ) to be opened by a friend . 
^ i 'm aware that 17's are heavy and awkward beasts and not to be carried too far ! 
^ thanks ,

^ &website &num jf you can catch a bus to &name , &name &name ( opposite &name &name ) is the name of the stop , which is , unsurprisingly , right next to &name &name , which is handy because you need to turn into &name &name and walk up to the t-junction ( maybe 100yards ? ) then turn left into &name road . 
^ along about &num yards on your left is no. &num - a mostly pale blue house with a green door . 
^ my phone number is : &num . 
^ any time afternoon would be fine for me - how 's &name or thereabouts ? 
^ i 'll be in all afternoon , so a bit of slippage &num way or the other is no problem . 
^ i 'll be happy to drive you back to &name with the monitor ( assuming you want it ) but parking around there is difficult , otherwise i 'd bring it to you . 
^ if you know of / can arrange parking in / near to the college on sunday afternoon , i 'll bring it over anyway - it 's not really the kind of item you would want to carry very far ! 
^ let me know if this is ok with you . 
^ &name
