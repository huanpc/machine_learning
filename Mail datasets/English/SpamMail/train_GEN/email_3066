" you ask . ^ well ... first please pray about this and get back to me asap if you 're up for it ! ^ or otherwise let me know if this is n't something you feel you should be doing . ^ even if you have n't decided yet - let me know , because this will help me work out if anyone has n't got this email . ^ then keep praying but do some thinking too ! ^ - we 'll try and meet sometime in  ame week - ( possibly monday / tuesday outside registration times . ) as soon as i figure out what 's going on myself i 'll let you know a time and date ! ^ be really good to see you all . ^ apart from this i 'm sure  ame and i will see almost all of you next weekend so if you want to chat about anything we can do that ! ^ finally ( i hope ! ) we 'd really like to see you all on wednesday at the cu guide to churches because it would be great to have a bit of a second year presence . ^ also - if anyone wants to 'represent " their church and tell us how wonderful it is please let me know , otherwise we 'll be coming round hassling people at the weekend ! ^ i think that is pretty much it ! ^ have a safe journey up to  ame and we 'll see you next week . ^  ame  ame , love  ame and  ame ^  ame if you think we 've missed anyone vital please let me know . ^ we 're quite flexible ! ^  ame if you think someone you know on the list above wo n't se this email - please forward it to them on another address , call them or just tell me ! </text_normal></part></message_body></message>
