^ hi there &name , 
^ well done on getting elected - were you uncontsted like me ? 
^ &smiley 
^ rape alarms : we sell them for &num quid from &name , but it is possible for me to send you a load and then for me to invoice you / newhall for the ammount , and then you can sell them at &name to your students . 
^ let &char eknow how many you want and you can either come and pick them up or i can post them to you . 
^ you could send an email roundn the &name and get a listr of poeple who are interested and then order that many frojm me , or youy coudl get me to send you an arbitary ammount , and then get more if you need to . 
^ on another note ; we have a welfare officer email list that i will add you to . 
^ also i have sent some stuff out recently to welfare officers , so keep &name on the old welfare officer , so that she passes stuff onto you . 
^ i know the undergrad welfare officer at newhall , &name , she is really nice . 
^ anyway - back to work ! 
^ &name 
^ ps new years ; we are n't really sure of what we are doing - just that we want to do it in &name . 
^ we were thinking of maybe joining to the &name , as it is only round the corner , and then everyone could stay over at ours . 
^ or maybe going to a nice pub somewhere for drinks and merriment - or the cheaper still option would be just getting in some crates and haveing a party at &name &name . 
^ &name and &name will probably be around , and &name and &name will also be a round ( from christs) . 
^ so if you coudl make it then it woudl be really great !

^ &name ! 
^ &name &name , 
^ i 'm officially the graduate welfare officer for &name &name now , so onto my first ( and only , so far ) item of business : you know the rape alarms that &name provide ? 
^ i know there 's some arrangement between the &name welfare officer here and &name so that she can distribute them in college rather than individuals having to go to the &name offices ... ? 
^ well , anyway , i do n't know exactly how it works ( the welfare officer has n't replied to an email that was sent to her ) , but i 'd like to sort out something similar for our &name . 
^ one of our members has asked the committee about it , after that article about a pervert targetting &name hall . 
^ would i need to find out how many people want an alarm and give you exact numbers ... ? 
^ or would it be possible just to pick up a load of them ? 
^ cheers ,
