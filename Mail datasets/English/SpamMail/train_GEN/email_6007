^ dear all some of you will be leaving &name in a few months and may be thinking how you can continue your musical life outside university . 
^ if you can sing , i would like to suggest that you consider the &name &name . 
^ the connection between cums and the &name &name goes back more than &num years and currently approximately &num third of the &name &name are ex cums members . 
^ the quality of the music making is far higher than is possible in many other amateur organisations , and it is worth noting that many instrumentalists who hitherto had rarely sang seriously , have left &name and joined the choir in order to maintain a connection with supremely high standards of music making , which they had found was not otherwise possible . 
^ the choir is a friendly club whose members have a common love of singing well , although the choir does not consist of a mass of budding soloists . 
^ many members have been in the choir for decades ( alarmingly i have been in the choir for &num years ) although the average age is getting lower all the time . 
^ many of the newer recruits are ex cums and the choir regards the cums as a wonderful source of intelligent singers , who all seem to fit in with ease . 
^ the musical director is &name &name , who was the organist and choirmaster of &name cathedral and becomes director of music at &name &name here in &name in october . 
^ he took over from sir &name willcocks in &num . 
^ the choir is definitely a choir and not a chorus and its repertoire includes a cappella works which other &name choruses could not manage . 
^ the &num members pride themselves in their ability to sound like a choir of &num . 
^ ensemble and quality are unsurpassed by any other choir of its size . 
^ the choir has a strong following and concerts are well supported . 
^ entry is by audition , but that is no more onerous than a cums audition , and &name &name sees all applicants . 
^ he now lives in &name and is willing to hold auditions during this term , well away from the pressures of exams and may week . 
^ &name &name is particularly keen to get tenors and basses . 
^ next years programme includes several performances : &name : missa solemnis , the creation , &name , a possible tour to the &name country , &name &name , &name &name , &name &name &name , &name &name &name and many more items not yet fixed . 
^ the choir rehearses in &name cathedral hall between &num and &num on monday evenings ( just once a week ! ) and then there is usually a pint afterwards in the cardinal next door . 
^ our longest range commuter is from &name , but a whole bunch of people come from &name . 
^ please drop &name an email soon if you would like an audition . 
^ &name &name
