^ ok , that looks great and solves all my previous problems . 
^ my only concern now ( sorry for bringing up more things ) is whether it 'll fit on the screen as it takes a full sheet in height ? 
^ i 'm not sure whether lecture &num can do that or not . 
^ ca n't think properly at the &name . 
^ if you think this is all ok , then please do just pass it onto &name / &name for printing . 
^ many thanks ,

^ ok , &name , i had had the permission thing in the lower left and then i thought maybe better top right , and then &char forgot to delete the first one ... 
^ i can do postscript if you can tell me how to ... 
</text_embedded>

^ oh , i tend to forget that not everyone has postscript drivers installed . 
^ in the techie world , postscript is a really standard format and everyone can deal with it . 
^ anyway , if you get the &name &name printer drivers from : &website says you need a &name file , try &website install that , you should be able to print to a file via that postscript printer ( save with a .ps extension ) . 
^ i would strongly recommend you compress ( using &name ) any postscript file before attempting to send it by e-mail . 
^ alternatively , you could try creating a &name file at &website free trial . 
^ i 'm not sure that 'll work though because of the fonts issue . 
^ thanks ,
