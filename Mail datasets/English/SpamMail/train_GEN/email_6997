^ choice in colleges teh &num next door to &name 's, i dont know whether that is a good way to do it or not , i just figured that if you were randomly going to go to something you might be more tempted if it were next door than if it were &num minutes away - &char dunno if that is true tho ... any better ideas as to how to discriminate ? 
^ - &name was just because it is easy for me . . ... 
</text_embedded>

^ ok - seems reasonable enough . 
^ i 'm not sure how effective blanket flyering is , so if you can think of better ways of getting rid of flyers ( more out around the town in pubs etc. might be worthwhile - we were definitely short this afternoon ) it could be worth considering .

^ &char left the note in &name 's pidge today , so hopefully she will get it and get back to me soon ... 
</text_embedded>

^ though she 'll probably refer it onto &name who has all the info & contacts , so it might be a couple of days . 
^ there is always the &name to try & catch them at . 
^ thanks ,

^ hiya , my hermes account is now back on-line - sending nearly &name of images to &name , &name and &name had n't helped my &name ! ! 
</text_embedded>

^ cool - you know you can ask for an increase in &name if you want it ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ your lot of posters is just mill rd etc - &name reps should get theirs . 
</text_embedded>

^ thanks - &name also confirmed this at lunchtime & pointed out that i just ca n't read and she did make that clear ! 
<text_embedded> 

^ we have a certain amount of flyerage that we can use for colleges - i have left a note to the &name reps to see if they want to blanket flyer &name , 
</text_embedded>

^ that might be a good idea - &name or &name would need to clear this with the college first however , so its probably best that they know your intentions earlier rather than later . 
<text_embedded> 

^ and i can always do &name . 
^ i might ask &name and trinity if thye want it as well 
</text_embedded>

^ is there any particular choice in colleges here ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - we have approx &num for doing blanket flyerings . 
^ but if &char wannna do &name , then hey thats cool - just let me know how many you need . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'm hoping to get it out on &name e-mail lists . 
<text_embedded> 

^ that stilll leaves &num for flt , bt , any sites we wanna do and the cums &num concert on saturday . 
</text_embedded>

^ sounds good 
<text_embedded> 

^ last time i spoke to &name she was getting better but not there yet ... i think that she appreciates still getting emails etc , still feeling that she knows what is going on , even if she is n't doing much herself ... 
</text_embedded>

^ she popped into &name today , so i saw her then which was good . 
^ i think she just could n't bear to rest in bed anymore , but she is seeming a bit better now ( but as you say , she 's still not &num yet ) . 
<text_embedded> 

^ annoying about &name . 
^ will bear it in mind for any future publicity 
</text_embedded>

^ cheers 
^ take care , 
^ love
