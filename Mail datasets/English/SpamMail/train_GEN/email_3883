^ &name - i say go for it ! 
^ are you up for asking &name whatisname at church on sunday ? 
^ i 'm away this weekend on the &name bonding thingy but will see you sunday evening / monday . 
^ have a great week - speak to you soon , 
^ love &name x 
^ &name ask &name and see what she thinks - sounds great to me ! 
^ hi &name , 
^ we could ask the band from &name , because they do that sort of thing i know ... and i think actually it would be easier to organise than ice-cream and games . 
^ i 've just been thinking that as fun as games are , with a changing number of people as often happens at parties , that this kind of thing would be more fun , and we would n't really have to organise people , or plan games , and we could invite a lot of people - and still have ice cream . ... you know it was &name 's b-day last week ... perhaps she would like to join us for a big party ? 
^ i do n't know , but it could be really good fun - &name always are ( except i ca n't spell them ... ) 
^ i still am waiting for a positive responce for funding for my phd . 
^ keep smiling ! 
^ lots of love , 
^ &name 
^ we sort of did i think . ... 
^ i was n't sure if we could organise it in time but if you think you can get the band , it would be great ! 
^ speak to you soon , 
^ &name x 
^ have we discussed possibly having a ceilgh for the party ?
