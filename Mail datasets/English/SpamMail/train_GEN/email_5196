^ &name : using semantics to integrate deep and shallow language processing 
^ abstract : 
^ formal compositional semantics is generally thought to depend on deep syntactic processing and on a detailed lexicon that includes information about subcategorization . 
^ this has led to semantics being ignored in much recent computational linguistic work that concentrates on robust , broad-coverage techniques . 
^ i will argue that even very shallow processing can be treated as manipulating logical forms , if a representation language is used which allows extreme underspecification . 
^ thinking of shallow processing in this way allows for the development of a general framework for integrating shallow and deep language processing .
