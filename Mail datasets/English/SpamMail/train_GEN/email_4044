^ hi &name , thanks for the great letter you sent us . 
^ we were going to write right back but who knows what happened in the interim . 
^ you sound like you are having a wonderful time at &name . 
^ it is always an adjustment for everyone when you go home for holidays . 
^ i 'm sure that you and &name felt that way and so did your parents to some extent . 
^ we had a great christmas , but a very busy one for the first week . 
^ my mom came and stayed for a week which was just wonderful ! 
^ many people wanted to come and see her so we had a constant stream of company for lunches and suppers . 
^ i must admit that we all enjoyed it though . 
^ &name is on a co-op term this term and working at &name bank in the somputer security section . 
^ so far he quite enjoys it and it is a little different than his previous jobs . 
^ &name and &name start exams next week so are busy getting organized for that . 
^ &name is a little nervous as it is his first set of exams at high school . 
^ he is very organized though and already studying hard for them so he should be fine . 
^ &name and i are both fine . 
^ &name has been away a bit with work but should be home now for awhile . 
^ we are still curling and will be going down to &name 's in feb. for a bonspiel with them . 
^ that should be a lot of fun ! 
^ i talked to &name after we got your e-mail and they had the same question we had . 
^ we thought that they must have sent you the wood you referred to in your letter , and they thought that we must have sent it to you . 
^ who sent you the wood &name and what did you make out of it ? 
^ not that we are nosey or anything , but you did mention it in your letter to both of us . 
^ ( we realize that &name copied the letter but did n't know that it went out to lots of people at the time ) . 
^ well i should go and finish cleaning and go out and do some shopping . 
^ it is very cold out today - wind chill factor of &num degrees &name . 
^ it is so nice just sitting here in the sun that i do n't really want to go out but must . 
^ take care and please send any letters you get around to writing . 
^ we love hearing from you . 
^ love from the lobbans
