^ i need to contact &name fairly promptly today , but since she does not have such easy access to a computer , i ca n't guarantee that she 'll get an e-mail from me . 
^ would you therefore phone her and tell her that i ca n't do the poster drop this afternoon ( as i 'm not feeling very well ) ? 
^ i 'll either find people who can do it ( i may &name posters to the cu reps ) or i 'll do it myself on friday or sunday afternoon . 
^ thanks ,
