^ i 've posted some documentation regarded the new split-versioned skeleton files system to the website , hopefully it will be in depth enough for some time ( unless we decide to change the system again : ) . 
^ we 're starting to get a nice nest egg of skeleton files together , but there are still some key &num missing . 
^ in particular , the libpng skeleton is non-functional until we can figure out the total mess this library has got itself into . 
^ if anybody could explain how , or better yet write a test script , to figure out whether &name , &num and &num are actually present on a system that would be really great . 
^ as an example of the extreme badness of this lib : 
^ yuck huh ? 
^ this is the sort of screwed up thing we have to deal with , hence the fact that skeleton files are useful . 
^ anyway . 
^ &name people find it helpful thanks -mike 
^ &name mailing list &email
