^ the only one i know of in &name " is that of the president , &name &name ( probably the best name of any college master / president / provost ) ... anyway , it is a pretty high quality &num and is probably not available for loan , but 
^ you could always try ... his e-mail address is : 
^ &email 
^ probably wo n't be of that much use , but may be worth a shot ... i have played 
^ it and it is very nice ... also he probably does n't exactly need the money , so in the unlikely event that it be available for hire i 'd speculate that it would n't cost too much ... hope that helps ...
