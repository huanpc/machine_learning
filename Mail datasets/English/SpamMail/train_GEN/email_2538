^ i did n't want to clog up people 's inboxes by e-mailing them all directly myself . ^ thanks ! ^ he said that insofar as there were any  ame publications , they were published by  ame , but that it was really quite a " loose " arrangement ; the " publication " that they have is the journal of linguistics but , though it 's the  ame " official organ " , it is actually independent of them and would continnue to be published if the  ame ceased to exist . ^ it 's therefore questionable to what extent we can really say that "  ame publications are done by  ame " . ^ he confirmed what i thought , that  ame may well want to charge far more money than we can afford to publish our stuff , unless they " take us under their wing " ( his words ) and treat us nicely because we are students of the university etc etc. he therefore suggested  um alternatives : ^  um . ^ preparing camera-ready copy ourselves and taking it to a small local printer ; all they would therefore have to do would be print the copies and bind them but not produce them . ^ this was , in essence , what  ame  ame suggested at our meeting . ^ apparently ,  ame was involved in something similar during his postgrad days in  ame and it worked well for them then . ^ there 's  um printer that i can think of off the top of my head that we could approach about this :  ame  ame and sons , who offer a thesis-binding service through the  ame  ame . ^ their website address is on their carrier bags and i have one in my room but ca n't remember the address ! ^ i 'll look next time i remember , unless anyone else beats me to it . ^  um . ^ the  ame idea that someone else had already had . ^ it 's getting popular and i am becoming convinced . ^  um other points that both  ame and  ame made were : ^ we ca n't possibly publish all the papers . ^ we need to establish some kind of elimination procedure and , using that , select about  um at most to publish , whether on a  ame or in print . ^ this will help  ame gain respectability ; people will get to know it as something that only publishes good papers , " a journal worth  ame " in  ame 's words . ^ i have to say i instinctively agree with him and  ame here . ^ they also said that a website was definitely a good idea but that we should n't put on it any more than was in the printed /  ame version ; so not all the papers there either . ^ they thought that our task in deciding which papers not to publish would be helped by some of them being obviously not of publishable standard and by other presenters simply not sending us anything to publish after the conference . ^ so perhaps we should n't chase them too hard . ^ they thought that publications only had the ultimate cachet of respectability if they had an  ame number . ^  ame numbers are simply bought and attached to publications , and  ame thought he could help with this . ^ apparently they can only be bought in batches of  um and he is going to have to buy some for a publication ( a corpus i think ) that he is involved in , but he wo n't need  um . ^ nor will we , he pointed out , so we could do a deal and buy one from him . ^ i do n't know when he is going to buy his numbers ( but presumably it does n't matter for the minute anyway ) or how much they cost now ( in  um it was $  um for  um ) , but it seems like a good idea to me . ^ we can contact him about that when we need to . ^ i think that this would apply if we were , in effect , publishing the proceedings ourselves , as i think  ame numbers are obtained by the publisher . ^ i think that 's all ! ^  ame this is so long . ^ see you soonish - all the best ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
