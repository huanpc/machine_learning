^ hi &name , 
^ in a phone conference with &name today , it emerged that it would be good for &name ( working on the matrix and &name composition ) to be up to date on dt-internal ( &char ) &name discussion . 
^ so , &char checked with ulrich and took the liberty of adding &name to the list . 
^ i hope you approve ? 
^ all best - oe
