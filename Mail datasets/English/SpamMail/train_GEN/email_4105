^ i understand your annoyance , and i am trying to make a decision . . ... 
^ i know &name will be quite stressed at the moment , so be nice to her . ... ( please ) as i said when i was in &name , i do n't know what my summer is going to be like . 
^ i am busy until probably the end of august . 
^ following that , there is the possiblity of work or phd , hence my non-committal stance . 
^ thirdly , &pound; &num is a lot of money which i do n't know if i have right now . 
^ ( i have to pay for my travel to &name for my interview too - cheeky university ) i 'll think about it , but if you press me now , i 'm leaning towards saying i ca n't go .
