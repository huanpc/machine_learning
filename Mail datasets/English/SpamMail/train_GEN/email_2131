" ^ - what do you mean ? ^ only that i 'm not always sure if there is any truth behind  ame 's musings . ^ sometimes there is , sometimes there is n't - that 's how i ca n't always tell . ^ i used to think i knew , but that only showed how much i did n't know of him . ^ get what i mean ? ^ you think you know someone , and then realise there is a whole load of stuff you did n't know about them . ^ its the same with anyone : it 's the getting to know people process . ^ whatever ! ^ " perhaps they [ guys ] need to communicate more frequently , but wo n't. " ^ - surely we 're not that stupid ! ? ^ i understand the need to try and solve the problem . ^ i also understand the release gained by sharing your troubles with someone else . ^ - good . ^ in a way though , i think the generalisation does sum up a lot of guys attitudes to things . ^ generally , a lot of blokes do n't find it easy to talk about personal stuff etc , and all i 'm saying is that they could do with opening up more . ^ just a thought . ^ " a venusian ( woman ! ) feels good . . . . . . ... a martian ( man ! ) feels good . . . . . . . ... " ^ - i think i disagree with this . ^ surely both men and women alike feel good when they have loving friends with whom to share their feelings and problems ? ^ why , how could marriage work if  um party decided they could solve all their problems on their own ? ^ - precisely . ^ the book is full of generalisations though , you have to realise that . ^ the author is highlighting some of the causes of relationship misunderstandings , and explains some of the basic instincts ( if you can call it that ) of men and women . ^ of course , they do n't apply to all people . ^ he (  ame ) now communicates with me only through his lawyer , a 'mr  ame " . ^ - you 're both as nuts as each other ! ^ ( or should i say , all  um of you are as nuts as each other - you ,  ame and  ame  ame ! ) ^ well ! ^ how do you like that ! ? ^ - very much . ^ i enjoyed reading it immensely ! ! ^ you 're in the soup boyo ! ^ perhaps you are unaware of the origins of this " un-tuck " joke . ^ - i was until now ! ^ very amusing ! ^ " what are you hatching up ? ? ? ^ i want to know ! ! ! ! " - i am unsure as yet , but i have some ideas . ^ - vague and mysterious ! ^ " lots of shopping . ^  ame ! " ^ - do you actually enjoy shopping ? ^ why ? ^ yes and no. i enjoy shopping to a certain degree : in moderation and when i can find what i want . ^ otherwise , no , i ca n't say that i do . ^ depends what mood i 'm in. the "  ame " referred to the fact that i 'd eventually bought all my presents , not to the " lots of shopping " . ^ ( power cut ) . . . . . ... we move from a little village of a few hundred people to an isolated hamlet / farm with only about  um people because we expect there to be more opportunities for power cuts out in the country , rather than in a village . ^ then what happens ? ! ^ there have n't been any in the last year ! ^ whilst you on the other hand , living in a sprawling metropolis of a city , have a  um hour power cut ! ^ talk about unfair ! ! ! ^ i 'm quite jealous ! ^ - what a funny life you lead  ame ( ! ) . ^ i quote : " you are a sad , strange little man ! " (  ame ,  ame  ame ) ^ - do you have collections ? ^ - no. do you ? ^ actually , i will have  um collection : i and my flatmates have to collect a cheque for  ound;  um . ^ from the beloved residents of  ame  har on our return to  ame . ^ how exciting ( i 'm feeling quite " anxious " about it ! ) . ^ - funerals are quite strange . ^ no , i ca n't imagine doing my own mother 's funeral . ^ does he really want to do it ? ^ - i do n't really know . ^ he was n't keen , but his brothers and sister are keen on him doing it , so i think he agreed coz of them . ^ " has anything arrived for you in the post yet ? " ^ - yes ! ^ it arrived yesterday ! ^ thanks soooo much ! ^ - you 're welcome . ^ the holographic doctor picture is soooooooo cool ! ^ ( it 's going up on my door next term ! ) ^ - i was going to send the captain  ame one instead , but then spotted the doctor and was sure you 'd prefer him ! ^ also , the  ame  ame  um stuff is really useful - all the pictures i wanted are there ! ^ - i have done very little picture manipulation so far . ^ i have put  ame 's head on one of the girls on the  ame cover . ^  ame asked me to do  ame and  ame , so i have to find a piccie of  ame too . ^ do n't tell  ame : i want it to be a surprise for her . ^ what is her address ? ? ^ i got it from you in the summer , but like with so many things , have lost it ! ^ i also want some ideas as to what i could do with pictures of  ame ,  ame ,  ame . . . . . . ... </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ my sister ,  ame , and  ame came down from  ame yesterday . ^ they stayed the night and are going back this evening . ^ they brought our christmas presents ( rather exciting looking : i 'm still feeling anxious about christmas day ! ) down . ^ they 're going back to spend christmas with  ame " parents and then are coming again at new year . ^ this morning we went to  ame lake to feed the ducks (  ame fun : just like when we were kids ! ) . ^ now we 're all feeling a bit whacked and  ame and  ame are watching " the remains of the  ame " while  ame is baking ,  ame is working , dad is at school ( ! ) , mam at work , and i 'm typing . ^ i 'm off now . ^ hope you 're having fun . ^ bye for now ,  ame ^ it 's nice to be important , but it 's important to be nice ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
