^ hey &name ! 
^ it was amazingly good to hear from you ! 
^ i do miss seeing you around and having little chats . 
^ how are you doing ? 
^ did you make any progress on monday with the whole job thing ? 
^ what are you looking for ? 
^ i 've found myself a job for the summer , in a solicitor 's office , bu not until i had got really frustrated with &name turned down everywhere i went , and then asked &name in desperation what on earth he had planned for me to do this summer ! 
^ the very next day this job turned up , so i guess that was an answer ! 
^ it 's admin , not very exciting , but the people are nice and i travel in with my dad and sister so i get to see more of them , which is great . 
^ when does &name go to &char &name ? 
^ ( i 've forgotten which country . ) or is she already there ? 
^ i bet she 'll have an amazing time . 
^ i would love to go back to &name but i think it 'll have to wait for another year . 
^ you asked how me and &name manage . 
^ well , by the grace of &name , pretty much ! ! 
^ you think you do a good job of holding your relationship together , until &name shows you that you totally depend on him , and it 's all the work of his hands ! 
^ that 's what i had to re-learn last term . 
^ i do n't think we do manage to maintain a good level of intimacy over several weeks apart , in fact after a few weeks conversations become really hard because &name becomes this disembodied voice on the phone . 
^ i have to keep reminding myself of what he 's really like , what it feels like to be with him , what i love about him , and that i do actually love him ! 
^ sometimes i 'm just going on head knowledge , really , &name my feelings kinda go in to hibernation . 
^ that 's when i have to trust &name and reaffirm my decision to love &name . 
^ do you know what i mean ? 
^ this weekend i 'm going to &name to meet up with &name , &name , &name , &name &name , &name &name and &name . 
^ i 'm so excited ! ! 
^ &name was supposed to be coming but she 's got some kind of virus &smiley 
^ anyway , i ought to go . 
^ hope you 're well . 
^ much love &name 
^ &name did you get my e-mail i sent to your dunelm address ? ?

^ hi &name , 
^ how are things ? 
^ i have been madly running around the country , visiting &name in &num places ( &name and &name ) and been on holiday with the third years in &name . 
^ i 've been having so much fun that i did n't realise how tired i am , and this morning , after a night of big scary nightmares ( including one where my female cousin was a mass murderer of blonde people , and i was her next victim , oddly enough ) i just feel very drained . 
^ i meant to be at the library this morning , to start glancing through old new scientists to find a job , but i just did n't feel quite up to it , so i am catching up on e-mails . 
^ are you excited about next year ? 
^ think about it ... you will be an old second year , who the first years look up to with a reverence like " wow ! " i hope , and pray that the first years coming in will be so on fire for &name , that &name will not just be thought of as a religious collage , but a college that is so alive with the power and love of &name , that people are so drawn to it that they put their faith in our &name . 
^ keep up your good work , dear friend , and please keep praying for the cu and college . 
^ i do n't know how prayer works , and i know that i am a rubbish pray-er , but i see people like &name and others , who have a great prayer life , and say " i want that , because it works ! " perhaps &num thing to pray for would be that the cu would start and keep praying . 
^ would n't that be great if the college could have &num main cu meetings - one just for prayer - &num people gathered together early in the morning to pray and see prayers answered . 
^ perhaps i am just dreaming , but it 's a nice dream , and &name is big enough to realise it , i guess ! 
^ i hope you are having a great time with &name . 
^ i do n't know how you manage to stay away from him for so long , in term time . 
^ how do you manage to keep up the same level of intimacy in that relationship , when you do n't see each other for long periods of time ? 
^ i start to crack if i do n't see &name for a few weeks or more . 
^ i 'm looking forward to having my future a little bit more planned . 
^ off to the library this afternoon . 
^ take care of yourself , and enjoy this summer ! 
^ &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ everything you 'll ever need on &num web page from news and sport to email and music charts &website
