^ do you think you could ask &name when she 's free to meet &name &name and i 'll then try to arrange a meeting with him . 
</text_embedded>

^ yep- it 's mornings or after evensong , is n't it ? 
</text_embedded>

^ &name , &name &name . 
^ which means 9-10am if its mornings ( although i could miss lectures )

^ i 'll start looking into curry houses as we do n't seem to have managed to arrange for anyone else to sort that out ... 
</text_embedded>

^ hmmm ... though i could ask &name when &char email her ? 
</text_embedded>

^ if she 's not too busy .. but i imagine that she probably is . 
^ and also it 's probably best not to have &name doing it since &name needs to stay behind after the concert whereas musicians & admin team ( minus &name and me ) should go ahead ( that includes &name musicians ) . 
^ true- and &char forgot to ask her just now anyway &smiley i wonder if &name might , we have n't asked her yet have we ? 
^ see you at the int . 
^ brek tomorrorow ?

^ hope so- although i 'm in danger of oversleeping ... tonight could be a long one ... &smiley take care , sleep well , love &name
