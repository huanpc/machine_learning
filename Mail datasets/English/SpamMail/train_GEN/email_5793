^ in word this is trivial . 
^ select the names . 
^ choose table | sort text . 
^ &name &name and change the text in the " other " box to a single space . 
^ click ok . 
^ change 'sort by " to " word &num " . 
^ click ok . 
^ subsequent lists ( altos , tenors , basses ) can then just be done as above , but all the options will be set , so after choosing sort text , just click ok . 
^ &name
