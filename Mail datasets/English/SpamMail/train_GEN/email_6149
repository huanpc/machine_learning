^ hi &name , well for me do n't worry about it . 
^ i 've compensated for the renaming bug , by using a batch file . 
^ so no sweat . 
^ i hope when you 're referring to being busy in your personal life this means things are going well for you . 
^ a lady perhaps : ) . 
^ talk to you later , christian

^ thanks for letting me know about your updated program . 
^ i will not be using &name &name until it 's out of the beta phase . 
^ do you think your newer version would be of use to me if i 'm still using innosetup &num ? 
^ i have version &num of your program . 
^ thanks again for making such a wonderful application , 
</text_embedded>

^ the older icon replacer will work with innosetup &num , but the newer one only works with &num . 
^ however , anyone with the inclination to do so could use the code provided for &num to get it working with &num . 
^ i might , but i 'm really too busy ( in my private life ) at the moment to be doing that .

^ you can get an updated version of &name icon replacer at : &website / which integrates into &name 3.0.2-dev ( source code also available ) and hence should resolved some of your complaints &smiley

^ okay let me start by saying these program names are far too similar : ) . 
^ just remember one has innosetup in the title : ) . 
^ both : 
^ - replace the icon of .exe files written in something other than delphi or innosetup . 
^ - propagate transparency from an icon data source . 
^ replace icon 
^ - does n't support .exes or dlls , only .ico 
^ - replace icon allows you to create or not create a backup of your .exe . 
^ i can always just recompile so it 's not that big of a deal . 
^ the actual program does n't divulge this syntax , but " &char " will prevent it from

^ - is a console application , while this is really annoying for &num time

^ use , 
<text_embedded>

^ innosetup icon replacer 
^ - is n't a console application , &name it has a &name ( graphical user interface ) 
^ - allows you to specify which file within an .exe , or dll you want to use 
^ - it also lists the icon number within the .exe or dll file , this is

^ formats 
<text_embedded> 

^ you 'll need to specify which file within the .exe will be used in the registry : [ &name ] root : &name ; &name : " 4square.documentdefaulticon " ; &name : string ; &website , 1' &smiley
