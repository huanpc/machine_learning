" ^ water , like flowing tears , washes over the inscription , lending its sound . ^ there are a few stone benches , but no other furnishings or decorations other than the light and the shadows . ^ the park is planted with shade trees . ^ towards the river is a long , low and wide wall . ^ it is also inscribed with names . ^ people leave flowers and offerings here , and can then stand and contemplate the sky and the river and the statue of liberty . ^ the border of the park towards  ame street and the rest of  ame is formed by series of gradually rising , terraced buildings . ^ these white buildings stand out against the old , jagged skyline behind them . ^ they house only international organizations dedicated to promoting peaceful cooperation in healthcare , agriculture and education . ^ if something in you resonates with this vision , please share it with your friends ! ^ [ non-text portions of this message have been removed ] ^ " work like you do n't need money, * * *  mail * ) ( ) love like you 've never been hurt, * * my  ame website : and dance like  um 's watching' * *  ebsite / " love your enemy , it 'll ruin his reputation "  ame tutu ^ " work like you do n't need money, * * *  mail * ) ( ) love like you 've never been hurt, * * my  ame website : and dance like  um 's watching' * *  ebsite / " love your enemy , it 'll ruin his reputation "  ame tutu </text_normal></message_body></message>
