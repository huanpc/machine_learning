^ perhaps it would be best if you did leave the key in an envelope in your pigeon hole tomorrow ( if that 's ok with you ) as i 'm not sure when i 'll be in town -probably at some point early afternoon . 
^ i can have a look through the parts and hopefully should be able to work out if there are any missing by the email addresses written on the front ... 
^ then perhaps i could come and take it back to &name &name 's at some point on weds or thurs , with you or another strong volunteer ! 
^ let me know &name 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ thanks for your email . 
^ i had emailed &name to ask him about the music as i was n't sure who had taken it after the concert , but he has n't replied yet . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ sorry , i should have e-mailed you earlier , but i forgot . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ do you know if everyone handed their parts back in ok ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i do n't know , as i do n't know what there should be . 
^ the number of boxes has been reduced to &num , but there is considerable overflow , so there may well be &num boxes worth of music here as there was originally . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i 'm happy to come and look through it and take it back to &name &name 's. 
^ we have until thursday officially to give them back to &name &name 's, but i guess i should look though it tomorrow just in case there are any parts missing to give us time to chase people up . 
^ are you in at all tomorrow ? 
^ when would be a good time for me to come ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ erm , i 'm out from 9.30am until about 5pm tomorrow , and then i have formal from 
^ &num 30pm . 
^ you 're welcome to come anytime from &name and i 'll happily leave my room open for you after 7.30pm if you want , but &name it 's cums &num on a tuesday evening . 
^ on wednesday i 'm out from 9.30am until ( probably ) very late . 
^ if you want to , i could leave my key in an envelope in my pigeon hole tomorrow and you could let yourself in ? 
^ that might be the easiest for you . 
^ the choice is yours . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ just to say thanks too for all the hard work you put in for the concert and all the organization months in advance ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal>

</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ the overall performance was very powerful , i thought , and moving . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ agreed . 
^ let 's be praying that &name would be really changing people who came , that they 'd read the programmes and gospels taken and really be challenged by what they heard and take action to find out more . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name that you 're feeling better 
</text_embedded>
