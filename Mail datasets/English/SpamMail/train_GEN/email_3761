^ hi guys ! 
^ after dozens of rejected funding applications , i have had my spirits greatly lifted by recent events in the region of funding for my &num digital mapping phd in &name . 
^ dad got in contact with a friend &name &name at work who has a close friend who is in charge of funding at &name in &name ( mr. &name i think ) , and will talk to him on my behalf . 
^ i talked to &name ( my supervisor ) about this today , and he had promised to re-write the proposal to make it way more software based , mirroring the predicted explosion of &name mapping that will take over the whole of the field sciences over the next &num years . 
^ i could see this going so very far , and with great possiblities for jobs afterwards too , which would combine both technology and being outdoors , and oh , i just can see so much good coming out from this . 
^ i so want it to happen .
