^ hi &name , 
^ i have a job . 
^ it is fairly disreputable but at least i am not a teacher . 
^ my goodness ! ! ! 
^ you 're working behind a bar ! ! ! 
^ how disreputable ! 
^ how could you ? ? ? 
^ i 'd rather be a teacher but not in &name , considering the exam mess . 
^ actually , not in &name either , considering the pupils . 
^ well , my holiday was great i sent you a postcard . 
^ the chocolate well , lets just say i do n't like chocolate . 
^ ( &name , horror , he does n't deserve to live ! ) actually , i brought back the knowledge of how to make a french chocolate cake . 
^ is n't that enough ? ? ? 
^ i have also acquired some french and swiss recipes , with a prolific use of garlic in them . 
^ i know all about &name and frankly these sick perversions disgust me . 
^ are you bluffing ? 
^ i read this in &name airport and became very worried very quickly . 
^ if you really do know about &name , then you must inevitably consider yourself one of the glorious elect . 
^ if not , then you must feel very insecure and be trying to cover up your lack of knowledge by ridicule and blasphemy . 
^ we shall find out . 
^ we have the ways . 
^ ( we is me , by the way ) 
^ &name this is a short e-mail , but i 'm developing my holiday photos . 
^ &name will inevitably follow as i have n't found a job yet sort of . 
^ best wishes , 
^ &name
