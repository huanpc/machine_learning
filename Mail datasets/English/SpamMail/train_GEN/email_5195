^ &name : what is the best way to map the &name ? 
^ my talk will look at the ways people have tried to map the &name over the last &num years or so . 
^ &char huge number of different maps have been produced , with very diverse forms and functions , ranging from simple geographic plans of cable routes to complex real-time &num visualisations . 
^ they have been produced for a number of distinct purposes from planning network deployment , operational management , to prove academic theories , as grad student projects , for market research , for monitoring public policy , for policing and intelligence gathering . 
^ and , of course , many have been motivated to map the &name for no better reason than because it is there ! 
^ there are many different aspects of the &name that have been mapped from physical infrastructures , logical layers and protocols , traffic flows , user demographics . 
^ the maps cover a range of different scales from &name up to global scale . 
^ many of these maps are beautiful and many more are really rather ugly . 
^ a few are actually quite useful , but many more are not very helpful at all . 
^ however , all the maps provide a fascinating picture of what the &name looks like , or rather they provide fascinating insights into what people think the &name should look like . 
^ i will review a number of the most interesting and useful maps and attempt to answer the question , what is the best way to map the &name .
