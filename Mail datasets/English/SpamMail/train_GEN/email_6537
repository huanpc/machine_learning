^ &name as i think you know i am involved in performance engineering of mainly web and call-centre systems . 
^ however in btexact there is a good deal of other performance engineering work going on . 
^ this ranges from mathematical analysis of how systems behave to computer simulation to testing , instrumentation , monitoring etc etc. its an area that really excites me and attached is a &name of a recent bunch of papers covering all aspects of performance engineering . 
^ ( sorry its so big , zipping made little difference so i did n't bother ! ) 
^ the reason i am sending this to you is for you to decide if this sort of thing interests you . 
^ given the prevailing financial conditions there is n't much in the way of full-time recruitment but given the length of your holidays there may be opportunities within this area for holiday work . 
^ i obviously cannot make any promises but some of the areas are ( as you can tell from the papers ) fairly high-brow and may appeal if you want a challenge beyond a bit of coding . 
^ &name what were your end of year results ? 
^ what options are you taking this year ? 
^ let me know
