^ hi students , 
^ a number of questions about the &name &num practical have accummulated . 
^ here are the answers : 
^ &num the baseline system should include treatment of &name arguments and other information -- just word matching is not enough . 
^ &num the deadline for it ( you should be finished with it by friday next week ) is just an internal deadline -- you will describe the entire system , baseline plus extension , in your report . 
^ &num the eval directory should now be visible from your directory . 
^ &name
