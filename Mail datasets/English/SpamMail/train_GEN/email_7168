^ no , i believe that this was the right thing to do and still do . 
^ come on , tickets are cheap enough to buy &num , one for yourself and one for a friend . 
^ and it would have been a waste of my time over the last year to get this concert together if we just fill &name &name 's chapel with christians . 
^ sorry , but i strongly disagree with this . 
^ trust &name , he 's been faithful before & i 'm sure we can trust him again now .

^ thanks very much for your replies to all the e-mails &name ! 
^ the gospels issue looks resolved and you can get them on friday at the &name as arranged . 
^ sorry if my e-mail re . 
^ the above point gave the wrong impression . 
^ yes , we completely trust &name in all we do , but we have responsibility as well . 
^ i agree though that my thinking came across wrongly here and may even be wrong . 
^ my concern is that we do not seem to sold even a a quarter of the tickets by this stage ( i may be wrong by now ! ) which concerns me , given all of the financial outlay and effort put in. ... 
^ &name this is all ok . 
^ i 've sent &name another e-mail re . 
^ &name 's plans for saturday . 
^ &name - thanks for the prog . 
^ i 've sent comments to &name , love &name
