^ what is the situation there ? ^ if you 're going , when will you leave and return ? ^ did i tell you that i bought a guitar in  ame ? ^ well i did and it is really nice . ^ i 'm now starting to branch out into the weird and wonderful world of nasty bar chords . ^  ame ! ^  ame everything is ok there , and look forward to seeing you in october . ^ take care ,  ame ^ oh , i 'll attach the little write up that i wrote for the college and  ame ( who gave me money for my trip ) who do i send the  ame thing to ? ^ welfare ? ^ and you buy electricity at the electricity shop , and seriously , that 's all i know , as i never ever bought it ! ^ ask  ame anything - he 'll know ! ^ the creation of a geological map in  ame  ame  har brief synopsis of  ame  ame 's mapping project , june - july ,  um ^ every british undergraduate geology student must complete a mapping project to be qualified as a chartered geologist . ^ as i am such an undergraduate , i too had to produce a geological map of my very own . ^ there were , however many unexpected and sometimes challenging obstacles which arose during the course of the planning and a realisation of this project . ^ more than once did i think , "  ame ! ^ i 've got this or that sorted ! " only to have my plans come crumpling down like a sandcastle in a heavy thunderstorm . ^ as i am generally quite paranoid about getting things to work out , i started thinking about this field-work even before the end of my first year at university . ^ i had planned to study part of the isle of  ame in  ame . ^ this island contains a fine mixture of many different rock types , which would be ideal for the creation of a geological map , so i quickly had all the arrangements made for a five-week mapping trip . ^ unfortunately with the arrival of  ame and mouth disease , all land in the british isles became out of bounds . ^ therefore , i had to look for alternative areas to map . ^ over the course of the planning , i considered many options including  ame ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame and the united states . ^ in the end , after many dead end roads which initially looking so good , proved their true nature , i settled upon an area in  ame  ame , to examine at an active volcanic area , just on the rim of the colossal  ame valley  ame . ^ this is a huge crater blown out a few millions of years ago as a result of an enormous eruption . ^ i was so very pleased to have finally got a feasible plan after so many had turned out to be impractical for various reasons . ^ because of the last minute nature of the trip , and the need to go abroad , the final cost of the trip was well over  um times that which i had originally estimated . ^ on the day that i finished my last 2nd year exam , i packed up my belongings and left  ame . ^ i returned to my home in  ame and within  um days was on a plane , flying at hundreds of miles an hour across the  ame . ^ after a connection and overnight stay in  ame , i caught a small plane the rest of the way down to  ame  ame . ^ although i hate to disillusion people , i must say that during my short stay in  ame  ame airport i did not find anyone with flowers in their hair and found the people generally quite gruff , not gentle . ^ however , the song does have a great tune . ^ anyway , i was greatly relieved to eventually see my  um mapping partners ,  ame and  ame about an hour after i landed . ^ in our rented car , we made our way across the state and after  um hours of travelling we arrived in the pleasant mountain resort town of mammoth lakes . ^ this town has a population of about  um thousand , which trebles during the wintertime , and independence day weekend when tourism is greatest . ^ this small settlement is that at an altitude of 8000ft , and so the air was noticeably thinner , particularly when climbing the mountains ! ^ after the first day , having walked over part of the mapping area , all  um of us were slightly worried by what we had seen . ^  ame the scenery was stunning , with great sweeping views of forests hugging the bases of the mountains , and the closer wind-swept pine trees scenting the air much more than even the most powerful air freshener , we could see few rocks . ^ we had come across some  ame lava flows , which were , in all honesty very impressive , but thoroughly unattractive piles of jagged volcanic glass , hundreds of feet high . ^  ame , we decided that we would avoid climbing these . ^ unfortunately , our decision did not stand very long . ^ it turned out that there was n't much else to look at in the area except for the lava flows , so up them we went ! ^ the flows were made up of hundreds of thousands of glassy boulders piled up on top of each other . ^ this is because , unlike the basaltic lavas common in  ame , these rhyolitic  um are much more viscous , and do not flow nearly so well . ^ as they cool and solidify , the rock cracks . ^ hence , they tend to pile up to form these dark , shattered lava domes , instead of the basaltic sheets . ^ having changed my plan to examine the detailed structure of the domes , i was now faced with a new problem . ^ how on earth would i do this ? ^ i had not previously looked at rhyolite for more than a few hours , and knew little about it . ^ so how would i map the subtle changes in individual lava flows ? ^ during the course of the  um week project , the way in which i did this changed many times . ^ the lava flows themselves were utterly desolate , containing perhaps  um scraggly tree every hundred metres or so . ^ the boulders were sharp , and were it not for a thick pair of gardening gloves , my hands would have been torn to shreds by the end of the first day . ^ the flows were in an area of a national forest that was not very highly populated , to say the least . ^ if i saw  um other person it was quite an event ! ^ there were some days when i would become frustrated with the never-ending sea of obsidian boulders . ^ the sun was always intense , beating relentlessly down upon my head , and the speed at which i went through factor  um suncream was truly astonishing ! ^ i would sometimes seek shelter behind a particularly large boulder , hiding in the little , but ever so refreshing shade that it gave . ^ however before too long i would be up and off again scared by the large volume of work which was still to be done . ^ after a good three-week period , i had completed the general mapping of the  um main domes that i would be studying . ^ i breathed more than one huge sigh of relief when i stumbled , and half fell down my last  um ft scree slope . ^ fortunately i had emerged relatively unscathed from these piles of glass and had only a few war wounds to show . ^ by the end of my study of the domes , i had almost perfected a  um legged walk , and could move relatively danger free across the flows . ^ what needed to be done now was to look at the area in between the  um domes . ^ for the most part this was covered in walnut sized pieces of light pumice , which as well as being hard to walk on , made life for all but the hardiest plants virtually impossible . ^ still the last  um weeks were much more pleasant as i did not have to place my life into my hands with every faltering and unbalanced step that i took . ^ now , the picture that i have painted so far is a rather bleak one , which is quite unfair . ^ i really did have a great time in  ame lakes , and got heavily involved in one of the churches of the town , through which i made many friends . ^ also , somehow , the harsh environment in which my mapping area was situated supported some deer ( do n't ask me how ! ) , one of which i saw on the same day . ^ by the time the last day arrived , in  um sense i was ready to leave . ^ i felt that if i had had another month , i could have accomplished a lot more in terms of the detail of the study , but i also longed to see my family once more . ^ one of my friends from the town took me to the local greyhound bus station , where i boarded an overnight bus for  ame  ame . ^ i tried to sleep on the bus , but this of course was next to impossible . ^ the fear of being mugged or killed by  um the other passengers was far too great to allow rest ! ^ throughout the trip , many thoughts we raced through my mind . ^ what would it be like not to spend my days mapping ? ^ what does the word " holiday " mean ? ^ how will i survive without any rocks to comfort me ? ^ eventually after  um or so hours , we arrived in  ame  ame . ^ my geology mapping project was over , and i now had a family holiday , visiting my old haunts in  ame to look forward to , and what better reward is there than that ? <text_embedded> ^ how you doing ? ^ i 'm not quite sure which country you 're in at the moment so i wo n't make any presumption except to say i know it 's about now that you 're due to be back in the centre of the universe that is the south of  ame ! ^ it 's been over a month since i last wrote to you and what a month ! ^ in the last e-mail i told you how everything was sorted for  ame  ame , that we 'd been down and measured the site and that it was all looking good . ^ well with a week to go we received a phone call from the farmer to say that unfortunately we would n't be able to use the field . ^ there were some sheep on the land an although they had successfully applied for a licence to move them , they would need to keep the field clear for  um days afterwards . ^  ame . ^ one of out backup farms was immediately brought on line an everything was set . ^ the only downside of this was that we had n't seen it , we knew however that it was larger . ^ with  um days to go everything was sorted when  ame received a phone call ( i bet he hated answering the phone ! ) from  ame  ame council to say that due to an increase in  ame in the area all lorries were prohibited from entering farm land and therefore they could not deliver the  ame we ordered . ^ this was not the only problem to us as of course all our food and the tents are delivered by lorry . ^ after an evening of phoning the farmers fax machine and little bit of quick thinking managed to get us in touch with them and they said they did n't have a problem with lorries going onto the site ! ^ we arrived on the wednesday morning to a huge and relatively flat field . ^ after a short while we managed to decided were everything was going to go . ^ we befriended the farmers wife who was able to help us with phone numbers for a new  ame and also for a  ame to dig a cess pit for us ( nice ! ) . ^ we were flying through advance camp , after  um days almost everything was up . ^ we had a good time of worship were we looked at romans  um :  um ( read for relevance ) and after visiting the pub went to bed . ^ we woke up on the friday morning to find that our generators had been stolen ! ^ a few phone calls and a  um hour round trip saw them replaced with bigger and better models paid for by the insurance and made us more security alert before there were any of the kids on site . ^ after that there were no more glitches , except that the guys who nicked the generators came back on site  um day ( at about lunch time ) to see if they could nick them again . ^ when challenged as to who they were they said " we 're looking for a couple of generators for tonight ! " laughed and drove off . ^ we never saw them again . ^  ame did some amazing stuff on the camp . ^ some of the times of worship were amazing and  ame spoke to many people , some for the first time . ^  ame ( better mention her somewhere ) had a really good time and it was really good for me that she was there . ^ mid way through camp i shot over to  ame  ame for a wedding which was really good and one of those " could n't have missed it for the world " type weddings . ^ it was just a shame that it was on the opposite side of the country . ^ i brought  ame back here after  ame an after spending a couple of nights here we both travelled down to her house where i stayed for just under a week helping to look after her  um nieces (  um and  um years old ) . ^ it was tiring if fun and great to spend a bit more time with  ame . ^ it 'll be the last time i see her before 23rd september when we 're both back in  ame . ^ that is , of course , if the  ame trip goes ahead . ^ i do n't know how much of the news surrounding  ame and  ame you 've seen but in the last week to  um days things have n't been the rosy and the phrase " they 're killing each other " pretty much sums it up . ^ we 're still wanting to go but if it 's not safe we will have to decided so . ^ on 29th we will make a decision not to go if it 's not safe . ^ if things are okay we will then live an hour at a time until we 're on the plane and in the air ! ^ before then i 've got various bits and pieces on . ^ in a fortnight there 's a holiday club for  um year olds ! ^  ame ! ^ i 've managed to get some reading for my course done , although not a great deal , but at least it 's a start . ^ all things "  ame  har " are picking up speed at the moment . ^ i 'm travelling to  ame a week today and moving some of my stuff in and at the same time getting some essentials from  ame into the flat . ^  ame  ame , electricity , bleach ... ! ! ! ^ anything that is n't too expensive and does n't require a fridge or freezer ! ! ^ over the following month the others are coming for various bits and pieces like regattas and the  ame  ame run . ^ actually you might be able to help ... where do you buy electricity from ? ^ there are n't any power stations in  ame so i 'm not quite sure ! ! ^ i know there 's a shop near by but i 'm not sure which  um and where it is . ^ also , do you buy cards from them or is there a key in the flat you " charge up " ? ^ so many questions ! ! ^ i hope the family and friends visiting was fun , stress free and rewarding for you and that you 're now looking forward to writing your dissertation . ^  ame all is well ,  ame  ame ,  ame <text_embedded></text_embedded></text_embedded> ^ do you  ame ! ? ^ get your  ame address at  ebsite </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ do you  ame ! ? ^ get your  ame address at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
