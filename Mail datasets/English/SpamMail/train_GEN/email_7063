^ i regret that &name &name is on sick leave this week so &name &name is managing student administration single-handed . 
^ this means that some things , e.g. the diploma photo , the final arrangements for part &num supervisions , will be delayed for a few days . 
^ we hope that normal service will be resumed next week , but in the meantime we appreciate your patience and co-operation . 
^ if anyone has a * serious * problem that needs resolving urgently then please contact &name in the first instance . 
^ she and i will do our best to deal with it . 
^ &name &name &name &name
