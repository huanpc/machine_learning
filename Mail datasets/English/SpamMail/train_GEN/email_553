^ dear &name , 
^ " i forget whether it 's my turn or yours , but it 's probably mine . " 
^ - so now it must be mine . 
^ i wish i was coming this weekend too . 
^ i enjoyed chatting to you a few evenings ago . 
^ did you 'shop till you dropped " in &name ? 
^ how did your sister enjoy &name ? 
^ so are you still enjoying having &name to stay ? 
^ say hi to her from me . 
^ what have you been up to this week ? 
^ today i have been at work etc. , etc. , rather boring stuff . 
^ this evening i finished all the chemistry i 'm doing this summer ! ! ! 
^ i am very happy ! 
^ now i can write emails actually , i 'm sure i have other things to do as well . 
^ i am getting a nasty cold at the moment and i am enjoying sneezing . 
^ ( well , it 's such an unusual experience , and it is rather pleasant . ) i put my virus down to my colleagues at work . 
^ they are all rather ill too at present . 
^ this is what comes when one integrates with society - i should never have left the house . 
^ actually , i should never have stopped drinking cactus juice something to take up again . 
^ here in &name the natives are gathering round their fires , plotting something wicked i 'll be bound . 
^ you can hear them at nights wailing and moaning softly to each other . 
^ some say it 's just the wind passing through the trees , but i 'm a chemist and therefore must know better . 
^ i fear they shall never let me return to &name . 
^ perhaps the southern redheaded one could use his influence on them . 
^ they are in awe of his powers of talking for hours about rocks . 
^ strange folk , the scottish barbarians . 
^ &name , only &num weeks of the summer holidays left . 
^ are you yearning to be back in &name ? 
^ i 'm not sure if i 'm looking forward to it . 
^ it 's rather funny , but most of the summer i miss being in &name with my friends , but then for usually about the last week or so i miss being at home with my family . 
^ surely it does n't take me that long to readjust ? 
^ oh dear , oh dear . 
^ i want a moose 's head . 
^ i wonder if &name brought one back from &name . 
^ he did say he would , but that was a year or more ago . 
^ such a charming object , a moose 's head , do n't you think ? 
^ so delightful , so imposing , so furry . 
^ i 'm sure &name would like one . 
^ well , i seem to have written some rather ridiculous nonsense this evening . 
^ never mind , i 'm happy with my chemistry . 
^ perhaps that 's the reason ; perhaps it 's the moon . 
^ perhaps it 's because i have n't done the &name &num crossword today and my brain has to do something with it 's excess neural energy . 
^ perhaps that 's the most ridiculous thing i 've every thought up . 
^ i do n't know ! 
^ have a lovely day tomorrow , whatever you and &name are doing , and do enjoy the weekend . 
^ i hope we can chat sometime soon . 
^ very best wishes , 
^ love &name
