^ &website 
^ when i run the exe file , it extracts fine , but then says it cannot open the source file . 
^ i 've noticed that when i first run the exe file , that there is a little check box at the bottom that says 
^ &website " 
^ &website " the { p } is not there . 
^ so there is something wrong because it thinks that { s } is a directory when it should be recognizing it as a drive letter . 
^ do you know what could be causing this or maybe there is a patch for this little bug . 
^ thanks for the help - the bible verse at the bottom is a wonderful witness too !
