^ i also noticed that most of the programs have tm after them , but not the microsoft &num . 
^ is this because there is no need to do this for &name ce and access ? 
^ i do n't really know about this , but if this is the case it might be better to &name them too . 
^ hardware for digital geologic mapping will be a rugged &name &name &name &name ce and a &name with optional &name &name , digital camera and digital ( if it is ) compass clinometer . 
^ issues to be resolved include the integration of traditional and digital geological mapping methods and hardware communications between different mapping equipment . 
^ the use of wireless technologies will be investigated to simply simplify ( remove simply ) the mapping apparatus . 
^ software to be used include digital databases ( &name &name ) , field-based and desk-top &name packages and visualisation software ( such as &name ) . 
^ here , the aim will be to design an appropriate database structure that will allow integrated and efficient data acquisition and visualisation . 
^ other then that , it looks great ! 
^ thanks so much &name !
