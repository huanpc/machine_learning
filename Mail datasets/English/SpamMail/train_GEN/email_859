^ &name , 
^ &name old boy ( as one of my church friends always addresses me ) . 
^ thanks for your text message - thanks for really &name your soul and letting it all hang out - great . 
^ am now in my next house , in a little town near &name . 
^ all is well , and i think i might even be able to set &name up soon and record some more music . 
^ how 's the work coming ? 
^ today i am going to try and acquire a new digital camera from an internet retailer . 
^ have you discovered the secret of happiness ? 
^ if so please tell me . 
^ bye 
^ &name 
^ &name , 
^ " i was leader of &num boys and they were just so noisy all the time . " 
^ - tell me about it . 
^ it amazes me how much energy children have . 
^ " yes , i acquired a number of female fans during the week and i am now being bombarded with text messages by one of them - oh well . " 
^ - a rather half-hearted attempt at feigning disappointment . 
^ " i now have &name staying with me . " 
^ - a word of advice - do n't leave him alone with your duvets . 
^ " life is crazy is n't it - i wonder what it 's all about . 
^ also , i wish that i was better at being myself all the time - then life would be less tiring ( sometimes ) . " 
^ - yes , it 's crazy . 
^ is n't it strange ! ? 
^ i feel like musing on existence . 
^ i know what you men about being yourself . 
^ it seems to be a modern tenet to attain to . 
^ life is easier if you do n't try to be something you 're not . 
^ but that 's no reason not to change , or allow yourself to be changed . 
^ &name , life 's funny , but it 's a lot easier if you look for the good things in it . 
^ i like being happy , it 's so relaxing . 
^ well , tomorrow i return to work dear me . 
^ i 've got lots of chemistry done this past week - wonderful ! 
^ have a good time with &name . 
^ &name midge repellent , ( i think that could be a hit too - do n't you ? ) 
^ &name
