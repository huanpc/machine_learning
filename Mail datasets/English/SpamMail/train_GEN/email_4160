^ dear &name , 
^ well , i presume you 'll be at home when you get this , but i liked the sound of &name &name " so i asked anyways . 
^ i am ( at the moment ) alone in my office , having just come back from a run called the " &name &name " . 
^ i had to run on my own today because the seminar i was in ran on until &num : 30pm . 
^ i gather the weekend was n't all it could 've been , what with football and &name going on camp both being cancelled . 
^ mum said that you were still in good spirits , though , which is amazing . 
^ i hear you are trying to learn to play 'my &name , my saviour " -- very adventurous . 
^ it 's not an easy piece , quite a lot of stretching to reach notes . 
^ i am going to try and think of some other pieces you might be able to learn . 
^ &name and i went to see " the &num towers " in &name on the weekend . 
^ it was good -- quite exciting and with some great scenery , but i do n't think i enjoyed it quite as much as the first one . 
^ i think because the whole movie was a lot darker , there were not many happy moments , like in the &name and &name . 
^ by the way , did you know that there 's a house near mine called &name ? 
^ an important game for &name on the weekend -- really important . 
^ do you think they can win ? 
^ tennis has been going well , i am told . 
^ i 'm looking forward to playing you . 
^ is there somewhere at the hookses where we might play ? 
^ i 'm planning to come and stay there too , provided i can figure the trains out . 
^ i 've been trying to do that . 
^ &num journey that the online booking site recommended would 've taken me &num hours to get from haverfordwest to &name ! 
^ &char _don't_ think so . 
^ well , i should probably get back to work here . 
^ i hope that today was n't too bad ( as school goes ) and that i can talk to you soon . 
^ in the meantime , keep practicing mancala so that i do n't beat you too badly . 
^ love from , 
^ &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ everything you 'll ever need on &num web page from news and sport to email and music charts &website
