^ &name , have you not checked your emails today yet , or are you totally and utterly offended with me and so are not talking to me , or are you expecting me to come and see you ? 
^ please bear in mind that , thought i do want to see you , i must finish my essay this weekend and that that will involve spending most of my time in the library . 
^ &name and i are having breakfast on saturday after she has stayed over , and then i am going to church twice on sunday , but that 's it . 
^ if you can come up to the library , we could have a coffee break &num day , but i ca n't lose much time . 
^ it 's not that i do n't want to see you , but i 'm not seeing anyone else and my work has to come first . 
^ i hope you can understand that . 
^ maybe see you this weekend , hope so ! 
^ &name x
