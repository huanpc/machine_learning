^ ok - email crossed . 
^ if this is a general problem with the extended &name characters we should just remove all of them , but i want to confirm this first . 
^ meanwhile , you should be able to use tr to remove all characters with codes above octal &num - but right now i ca n't seem to get it working . 
^ sorry - i 'll have to sort this out tomorrow
