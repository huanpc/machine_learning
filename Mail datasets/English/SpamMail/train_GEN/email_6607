^ dear &name , 
^ you really should n't be running around &name buying people flowers , with all the work you have to do and busyness etc. ! ! ! 
^ do take care of yourself and do n't worry too much about thanking everyone . . ... we should n't be doing it in order to be thanked anyway . 
^ having said which , thank-you so much . 
^ it was so lovely to get home today and find flowers and your wonderful god-centred card ! 
^ i thank &name for the work he has done in the lives of people like you and &name . 
^ so many people out there do n't live according to the love of the cross , and i was feeling this painfully last week . 
^ the contrast was an encouragement to me and the way everyone was serving &name during the concert helped me through a spiritual battle i was fighting . 
^ the way you and &name have run the concert has been an inspiration to me throughout . 
^ somebody should thank-you for your willing service and the kindness and love with which you treated your team . 
^ as i said to &name , i do n't know who 's job it is to do this , but anyway , i thank you on &name 's behalf , as it were ( if that 's not a dodgy theological position ! ! ! ) 
^ talking business : 
^ - should get stapler to you tomorrow 
^ - money spent on extra programme photocopying was &pound; &num do you need a receipt ? 
^ praise &name indeed for providing for us even when we mess up ! 
^ if you are writing me a cheque please make it to &name &name &name &name chew . 
^ - as for debrief / praise meeting , am generally free except evenings tuesday and wednesday , friday afternoon , thursday early afternoon and mornings monday to saturday . 
^ how exciting that you were brave enough and were given the opportunity to have such conversations with your supervisors ( i could never do it ! ! ) i will certainly pray . 
^ and i will be praying for you also in your work deadlines and for energy and organisation in general . 
^ i live in awe of people who can sustain that level of activity ! 
^ i 've been sat about recovering from last week , and praising &name for the space to breathe ! ! 
^ i will also pray for &name . . ... i know how horrible it is to be ill and get even more behind on work and feel lost and out of control . 
^ as for me , i have plenty of time and rest now but no motivation ! 
^ i just ca n't seem to get started working properly . 
^ it 's hard because i really do n't like my subject , am now very behind and am aware that i 'll be doing philosophy next year . 
^ please pray that i will remember the cross and the glorious &name whom i am serving and will recover the joy to keep fighting on with maths . 
^ &name &name that i got good marks on the &num catam projects so now have &num alphas ! 
^ pray for my meeting with the &name &name on &name and for a smooth process of pushing the official stuff through . 
^ last night i was up all night at &name again ! ! 
^ and my co-volunteer was the president of the &name , &name &name . 
^ i had a ( slightly difficult ) conversation with him . 
^ he says he just ca n't bring himself to believe that &name was &name . 
^ he says he has many christian friends . 
^ please pray for him . 
^ please also pray for &name &name , my &name acquaintance who has told me he is reading the bible ( &name , in fact ! ! ! ) also , i took a call from someone trying to decide whether or not to have sex with his girlfriend , which was a really hard as i am not allowed to be directive or give an opinion under &name rules . 
^ please pray that &name will put christians in his life . 
^ he definitely felt within himself that it was wrong but was being confused by what other people were saying and the climate in college . 
^ sorry , this list is so long ! 
^ try to get plenty of rest when you can and worry about yourself as well as other people ! ! 
^ ( &name if you crash , you wo n't be able to serve &name very well ; trust me , i 've been there ! ) 
^ what a mighty and loving &name we serve ! ! 
^ what a relief to be able to stand in his strength and trust that he is in control ! ! 
^ love , &name

^ hi 
^ i popped round this evening , but you were out . 
^ the flowers are from me a &char &char thank you for your support & encouragement you 've given me through the concert proceedings and for the kindness , generosity and concern that you showed to me . 
^ thank you ! 
^ the other item should be fairly self-explanato ry . 
^ glad to hear that you 're feeling a bit better , well rested and more posit ive . 
^ do make sure you get plenty of rest until you 're completely better and do n't try to push yourself . 
^ &name is in control , and that goes for your maths to &char ! 
^ &name &num , &name &num : &num , &num &name &num : &num , &name &num : &num etc. 
^ i could do with knowing from you how much money you 've spent on the conce rt , both for publicity ( stationary etc. ) and programmes ( &pound; &num ? ) . 
^ we 've got enough money in the income as far as i can see to pay for all of this ( pr aise &name for this ! ) so let me know and we can reimburse you . 
^ as for the stapl &name , there 's no rush , so get it to me in your own time . 
^ might be easiest to &char ive it to an &name at stag on sunday . 
^ as for me , i 'm fine , though as to be expected very busy ! 
^ i guess prayer for help to fit everything in that i need to ( group project deadline far too close for comfort ) , that i would n't overly stress with it all and for relations with the rest of my group would be good . 
^ i also had some interesting conversations with one of my supervisors at comp . 
^ sci . 
^ formal hall yesterday , so please do pray for them - both ex " christians " . 
^ as fo &char &name , she has n't been particularly well either , though we 've been prayi ng for her too and she 's getting better . 
^ obviously it 's hardly helped her &char ork situation though . 
^ so if you could pray for her , i 'm sure she 'd really appreciate that . 
^ is there anything else i can be praying for for you ? 
^ take care and look after yourself , 
^ love &name 
^ on wednesday &num &name &num &num : &num , you wrote :

^ just having temporary custody of them . . ... do n't know if you want to pass them on to the team for next year 's concert or sell it to &name &char ( &name &name suggested this . ) anyway , if you want the stapler to &char &char anywhere let me know . ... i 've no use for it ! ! ! ! 
^ &smiley

^ well , they 'll shortly become &name property as they 've gone under the admin budget ( we have an income in excess of &pound; &num so hopefully sho uld have enough money even to cover to additional photocopying ! ) so i 'll pass them onto &name along with other bits and pieces once i have them all 2e if at some point you can let me have them so i can put them in my collection for &name , that 'd be helpful , but there 's no rush . 
^ hope you 're feeling a bit better and will keep praying for you , love &name
