^ i think ( with a little help from &name ) that i have now solved the great mystery as to why none of the freshers made it to the squash . 
^ the simple answer is incompetence . 
^ not the incompetence of &name &name to drink without passing out , or the incompetence of &name to cut his hair - but the incompetence of &name 's leading student newspaper to print the correct date . 
^ i ask you , when the &char * * * was friday 9th october ? ? ? 
^ are they talking &num ? ? 
^ the freshers will have graduated by then ! 
^ &name , we should not rest until this racheal &name has been sacked , whether or not she was you 're friend . 
^ &name 
^ &name - the artical can be seen at &website
