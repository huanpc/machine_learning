^ hi bet you 're shocked since this is the 3rd time i 've written to you this week . 
^ we went out last night and went to &name &name &name . 
^ it was ok but i didnt dance at all and when we went in i felt really sick . 
^ &name told me the bouncers were really strict so &name told me to stick my fingers in my throat . 
^ i tried but i failed . 
^ i just ended up with a sore throat . 
^ the place is really nice inside . 
^ it reminds me of &name if you get what i 'm saying . 
^ i cant be bothered to describe it to you properly so tough . 
^ &name and &name had a race outside the flat but i slept . 
^ &name told us this morning that he puked after it . 
^ we went to a chippy and i had a haiwian ( how do you spell it ? ) chicken sizzler . 
^ basically its chicken with lots of crap like cheese bacon coleslaw ( yuck but i couldnt taste it so it was ok ) etc. did i have chips with it ? 
^ no. i believe the fucking chippy had no chips left . 
^ would you believe it ? 
^ did you know &name is moving out of her flat at christmas ( i think its then) . 
^ &name &name is giving her the car to run back and fore with . 
^ you do realise that she 'll be getting up at &num to take him to work first . 
^ next week i 'm going to spend in the library working on my second essay . 
^ i handed in my sociology one yesterday and its my psych &num next . 
^ its due on the 30th of nov. i also have a soc presentation ( the 2nd ) in &num weeksbut i only have to speak for &num mins . 
^ tonight we 're going to see sixth sense if we can get tickets . 
^ if not we might go and see east is east cause that looks really funny . 
^ i saw &name for the 3rd time on monday . 
^ on wednesday we saw &name &name . 
^ it was ok but not that great . 
^ it dragged on far too long . 
^ you should definately see &name witch although i think its more scary reading about it . 
^ you should go to the website before you go . 
^ it tells you about the legend which of course is completely made up but when you know all this its creepier . 
^ i still havent been to the site but i got a little inside film magazine at the cinema and that tells you everything . 
^ its great how they 've marketed it as true i think . 
^ they give you an expert on witchcraft 's report on their findings and stuff . 
^ again completely made up . 
^ i wouldnt mind a read or the &name which i think is notes the girl takes . 
^ on the subject of books , you know fine that i have completed my little miss collection but i only have &num or &num &name men books and &num or &num are &name . 
^ he feels shit today by the way . 
^ i bought another double hardback &name for a fiver . 
^ not bad when the single paperbacks in the same shop are &num , &num pounds . 
^ i 've got the chamber , the street &name , the client , and the &name . 
^ i 'm getting his new one for &name from &name if he remembers of course . 
^ by the way , dont bother complaining that you have &num weeks left cause i have more . 
^ on saturday did dad tell you ? 
^ me and &name were sleeping by half &num . 
^ at half &num i gradually heard the doorbell . 
^ he had phoned and no one answered ( &name was at mams ) so he phoned &name and got her to come round . 
^ i was raging and do you know what he said the next day ? 
^ he asked why i was sleeping so early . 
^ can you believe it ? 
^ i was chuffed that i had done it for once and it took me ages to get back to sleep . 
^ &name didnt even waken of course . 
^ are you going to a bonfire tonight ? 
^ we 'll probably have a scan at the one in &name park if we 're not at the pictures when its happening . 
^ they didnt have a fire last year but the fireworks were really cool . 
^ its probably the same this year . 
^ i 'm going to the final tomorrow . 
^ just thought i 'd say . 
^ it means i have to leave work early . 
^ what a shame ! 
^ not ! 
^ blast from the past eh ? 
^ the not i mean in case you didnt know . 
^ you 'll have to e-mail &name sometime . 
^ it cost me &pound; &num for a taxi from &name this morning . 
^ i 'm sure he took me the busy way so it would cost more . 
^ i bet you 're really shocked now cause this is the longest e-mail i 've ever sent and its in paragraphs with punctuation ! 
^ got to go cause i 'm fed up writing . 
^ lots of love , &name xx 
^ &name i 'm going to send you a &name e-mail . 
^ &name sent it to me . 
^ its pure filth . 
^ &name &name &email
