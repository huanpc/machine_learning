^ hi &name , 
^ we received your email and the email which &name forwarded to us . 
^ we organised a &name team in &num and a joint &name / &name team in &num . 
^ we were going to organise a &name team again this year , but are n't able to do so now . 
^ we 'll give you the names of all the contacts we 've made or found out over the past few years . 
^ &name gave you the names of all the people from the &num team , but there are n't many of them left around ! 
^ &name and &name &name have moved back to &name ; &name &name has moved to &name ; &name &name has moved to &name ; &name might still live in &name , although he 'd just left college at the time , but he came because he was &name 's friend from college , so i 'm not sure if he 'd be interested if &name 's not here ( &email ) . 
^ so that leaves us too and &name &name . 
^ &name 's used to play for &name . 
^ he might want to play for &name as his wife will probably play for them ( &email ) 
^ here is a list of other possible players who we 've either contacted before or were planning to contact for a team this summer : 
^ &name o' &name ( &name &name . 
^ &name was interested in playing for &name this year when we discussed organising a team earlier this year ) &email 
^ &name ? ? ? ? 
^ ( plays for &name and lives in &name ) - he expressed interest in putting a team together last year . 
^ &name &name ( &name played in a couple of tournaments for &name &name last year and also this summer too . 
^ &name is n't a regular korfball player so you 'll probably have to explain to him about counties . ) &email 
^ &name &name & fiancee ( &name ) . 
^ i ca n't find &name 's email address . 
^ ask &name ( below ) or &name &name from &name ( &email ) 
^ &name &name ( &name ) &email 
^ &name &name ( &name ) &name to ask &name for &name 's address as i 'm not sure if the one i 've got is correct . 
^ &name &name ( from &name &name ) . 
^ &name was interested in playing in &num , however she 's a teacher and so takes holidays during the school holidays and so was n't able to play . 
^ &email 
^ &name &name - we contacted him in &num , but he played for &name then , where he was at university . 
^ &email 
^ &name &name ( used to play for &name before going to &name for a year for work in &num . 
^ do n't know if he 's back yet , but someone at &name will know . 
^ you could contact &name &name from &name to find out &email ) 
^ &name &name ( &name ; i think he has 'retired " from korfball , however he often turns out at counties for &name . 
^ although he usually plays for &name above other counties , but he was going to play for us in &num if we did n't have enough players , but in the end we had enough players ) &email 
^ &name &name ( &name ) - last year he managed &name and may be again this year . 
^ &email 
^ &name &name ( used to play for &name . 
^ not sure if he still lives in &name . ) 
^ &name &name ( &name ) - we asked him to play in &num , but he played for &email 
^ &name &name ( &name ) - we asked her to play in &num , but she played for &name . 
^ &email 
^ &name &name ( used to play for &name ) - he either moved to live in the north or went travelling for a year - i ca n't remember which . 
^ not sure if this email address still works : &email 
^ also i think &name &name told us in &num that she knows someone called &name who used to be from &name who lives in &name , but i do n't think she had any further contact details . 
^ &name this list helps . 
^ if you need info on players from &name , i sent a whole list of players to &name &name a couple of years ago when he started the &name / &name team . 
^ you could try contacting him ; i 'm not sure if i 've still got any details , but if you need me to look , let me know . 
^ &name &name and &name

^ hi &name , 
^ by the sounds of it you 'll have received a similar email to this several times over by now . 
^ i thought it would still be a good idea to contact you directly . 
^ are you interested in playing for a &name county this year ? 
^ would you be able to give me some contact names for eligible people , or to publicise this plea around the &name &name club ? 
^ any help would be appreciated , 
^ thanks , &name &name
