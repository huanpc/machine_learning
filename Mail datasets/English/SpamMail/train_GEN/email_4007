^ dear &name , 
^ in case you 're still thinking of what to get &name for christmas ( or perhaps even his birthday ? ) , i know that he 'd really like a video of " the fugitive " . 
^ he thinks i 'm going to get it for him because i asked him what he 'd like and that 's the only thing he told me , but i 've actually got him something else as i wnated to surprise him - so , maybe you or &name would like to give him that instead ! 
^ see you soon ( saturday i hope ) , 
^ love &name xxx
