^ hi &name , 
^ &name that things are ok with you . 
^ &name ( who does theology with you & sat opposite me at the curry on sunday ) asked me to find out about the tree in &name court in &name . 
^ i was wondering if you could let him know for me that nobody quite knows what it is , except that it is a rare tree from &name , given to the college many years ago by the emperor of &name and is supposedly the only one of its type in &name ( but others dispute this fact ) . 
^ thank you ! 
^ see you soon
