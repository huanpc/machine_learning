^ &name &name , i 'm really sorry i missed your actual anniversary , but i hope you had a happy one anyway . 
^ did you have a celebratory meal or something ? 
^ i ca n't wait to get home and eat some real meals . 
^ well , i did go out for a chinese with one of my neighbours on sunday , but i was n't feeling that great so i did n't get to stuff myself . 
^ bit of a waste of money really . 
^ is your winter getting really bad yet ? 
^ it 's quite mild today with us , but sometimes it 's really bitter . 
^ there 's not a lot of rain , usually , and never any snow , which is ... well . ... a bit boring really . 
^ i got a letter from &name yesterday , and she mentioned she did n't have time to send you both a card . 
^ her letters are quite funny . 
^ well , i have a lecture soon , so i 'd better go . 
^ if you can send me an email before the end of term that would be nice , but i 'll be home soon anyway . 
^ you can keep me informed about &name and his antics wherever i am , anyway . 
^ speak to you soon , 
^ &name
