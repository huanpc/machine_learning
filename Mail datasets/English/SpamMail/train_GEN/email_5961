^ &name all ! 
^ i hope the end of term is n't proving too stressful - the terms do just seem to get shorter and shorter ! 
^ just a quick note about the advent &name service at 6pm this sunday - it would be good to have as many clerks as possible around for this , to help with the general candle lighting and also for crowd control ! 
^ if we meet at the chapel around &num , that should give us plenty of time . 
^ also , as some of you may know , &name will not be around for the rest of the year , having returned home to consider what she would like to do - hopefully she will be back next year . 
^ &name and i thought it would be a nice gesture if we were to send a card from all the chapel clerks to thank her for her help in chapel , and to wish her well for the rest of the year until , with luck , she returns . 
^ i have put a card in my pigeonhole - it would be great if you could sign it over the next couple of days . 
^ many thanks !
