^ attached is the &name file , but i found a workaround that seems to work on all versions of windows . 
^ &website files that &name creates can take an &name command line &website until the &website ( or whatever ) is finished . " it was added to support the &name systems management system , i think , but once i added that to the command line in my &name file , it worked like a charm . 
^ ( i do n't think it 's in the version i 've attached - i ca n't put my hands on the latest and greatest version of my &name file at the moment . ) 
^ thanks for your help , and for a great program !

^ i do n't suppose you could send me a sample of a &name with an installshield setup that does this on &name ? 
^ thanks ,

^ &name &name : &name , free & easy for file sharing &website

^ as you suggested , &num downloaded the &num version , but i still have the problem where &name deletes the files before installshield is finished with them . 
^ as far as i know , this only happens on &name me 
^ - i know it works okay on &name , &name , and &name . 
^ ( i do have the &website or whatever it 's called included in the installshield kit . ) 
^ i hate to turn off the 'delete files when done " switch , but the only other alternative is to make separate installation kits for &name . 
^ let me know if i can help you debug this , or if you have any ideas . 
^ thanks .
