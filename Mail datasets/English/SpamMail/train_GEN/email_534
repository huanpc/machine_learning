^ dear &name , 
^ thank you very much for replying to my text messages ! 
^ i like having a mobile phone ! 
^ anyway , i hope you 're managing to cope a little better with the heat . 
^ if not , then put your head in a freezer for a while . 
^ or , think of poor &name and &name going off to &name , where it is doubtless hotter still . 
^ today i worked in the morning and finished tidying away my &name stuff in the afternoon . 
^ then i helped my dad in the garden for a while . 
^ &name , i hope you enjoy your weekend in &name . 
^ will you see anyone there whom i know ? 
^ by the way , i was wondering if you 'd heard from &name this holiday . 
^ he has n't e-mailed me at all . 
^ neither has &name . 
^ well , i think i shall go to bed now . 
^ my parents had to buy black-out curtains for me to stop the light waking me in the mornings ! 
^ the sun was getting me up at &num : 45am . 
^ i hope you have a lovely day tomorrow . 
^ see you soon . 
^ &name
