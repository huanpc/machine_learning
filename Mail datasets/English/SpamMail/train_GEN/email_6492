^ ok , &name , i had had the permission thing in the lower left and then i thought maybe better top right , and then &char forgot to delete the first one 
^ i can do postscript if you can tell me how to ... 
</text_embedded>

^ oh , i tend to forget that not everyone has postscript drivers installed . 
^ in the techie world , postscript is a really standard format and everyone can deal with it . 
^ anyway , if you get the &name &name printer drivers from : &website ( if it says you need a &name file , try &website that , you should be able to print to a file via that postscript printer ( save with a .ps extension ) . 
^ i would strongly recommend you compress ( using &name ) any postscript file before attempting to send it by e-mail . 
^ alternatively , you could try creating a &name file at &website free trial . 
^ i 'm not sure that 'll work though because of the fonts issue . 
^ thanks ,

^ maybe it 's my computer but 
^ &char i get &num copies of " by kind permission " , one at the top right and one on the lower left . 
^ any reason for the repitition ? 
^ &name it looks out of place in the latter . 
^ &char the box for the ticket information seems too big . 
^ but this may well be my computer , because i 've not got the fonts installed properly on this system . 
^ any chance you could send it in a more 'standard " format ( eg postscript ? ) . 
^ that might make validating it a little easier. . 
^ thanks & sorry to be a nuisance &smiley
