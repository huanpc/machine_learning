^ hi 
^ are you free after &name tomorrow ( or the equivalent time ) ? 
^ we desperately need some people who can do flyering for the &name &name &name &name concert after the cums concert in &name road . 
^ it 's an easy job ( give out fliers to anyone who 'll take &num ) and should n't take too much of your time . 
^ if you can make it and are willing to help , please e-mail &name &name ( &email ) &name and she 'll give you any information you need . 
^ many thanks ! 
^ love &name
