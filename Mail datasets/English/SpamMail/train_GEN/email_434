^ dearest ... i did n't mean that &name does n't want me to change , i meant that he accepts me as i am and judges me in the most holy and righteous way , he does n't want to make me change , he wants me to change because i love him , not for the sake of being " good " . 
^ i think i do compromise my principles more than &name , which is not good , but then my principles are differnet to his , so he may consider something i 've done a lapse when i would n't, if you see what i mean . 
^ &name is very pricipled , which is cool , and i reallt appreciate that in him . 
^ but i know what you mean about suffocation .
