^ hi &name , thanks for getting back to me . 
^ since i need something that will work for me from the command-line . 
^ i 'm going to use replace icon . 
^ however if after evaluating innosetup &num , i find i like it then , i 'll definitely install you application . 
^ by the way why is n't you add-on listed at &website ? 
^ i think &name would be willing to list you on the following &name : &website . 
^ thanks , christian 
^ somehow or another i seem to have lost the command line switches and i ca n't find it in your documentation . 
^ your application does support them right ? 
^ if so can you send me the syntax , a document containing the syntax , or a web address listing it ? 
^ thanks , 
^ are you using the innosetup icon replacer or the &name &name icon replacer ? 
^ they have different interfaces . 
^ if you are using the former , you can download an update to the compiler which enables integration into your script at : 
^ &website / 
^ if you are using the &name &name &num , then you can only current specify the name of the file to modify on the command-line . 
^ regards , 
^ &name
