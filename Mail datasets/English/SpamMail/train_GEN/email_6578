^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website .

^ &name : 
^ this patch eliminates a newly discovered vulnerability affecting &name information services . 
^ although &name typically delivers cumulative patches for &name , in this case we have delivered a patch that eliminates only this new vulnerability , while completing a cumulative patch . 
^ when the cumulative patch is customer-ready , we will update this bulletin with information on its availability . 
^ the &name provides information on the circumstances surrounding the vulnerability , and why we believe releasing a &name patch immediately is in customers " best interests . 
^ to ensure that servers are fully protected against past as well as current vulnerabilities , we strongly recommend installing the previous cumulative patch ( discussed in &name &name &name ms02-01&smiley before installing this patch . 
^ the vulnerability is similar to the first vulnerability discussed in &name &name &name ms02-018 . 
^ like that vulnerability , this one involves a buffer overrun in the &name &name data transfer mechanism in &name &num and &num , and could likewise be used to overrun heap memory on the system , with the result of either causing the &name service to fail or allowing code to be run on the server . 
^ the chief difference between the vulnerabilities is that the newly discovered one lies in the &name extension that implements &name - an older , largely obsolete scripting technology - where the previous one lay in the &name extension that implements &name . 
^ mitigating factors : 
^ - &name has long recommended disabling &name functionality unless there is a business-critical reason for retaining it . 
^ systems on which &name is disabled would not be at risk from this vulnerability . 
^ - the &name &name &name &name &name by default in all server configurations . 
^ - the current version of the &name tool provides a means of blocking chunked encoding transfer requests by default . 
^ - on default installations of &name &num , exploiting the vulnerability to run code would grant the attacker the privileges of the iwam_computername account , which has only the privileges commensurate with those of an interactively logged-on unprivileged user . 
^ &name &name : 
^ - &name systems : moderate 
^ - &name systems : moderate 
^ - client systems : moderate 
^ &name availability : 
^ - a patch is available to fix this vulnerability . 
^ please read the security bulletin at &website for information on obtaining this patch .
