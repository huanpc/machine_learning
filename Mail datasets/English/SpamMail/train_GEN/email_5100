^ people will have noticed that the &name fileserver has had problems for the last few days - in particular there have been long periods of time when it has been refusing to do " write " transactions . 
^ as of mid morning today , the problem is understood . 
^ it is arguably a bug in the &name , being provoked by pathological client behaviour . 
^ the particular client believed to have been causing the recent incidents has been subdued . 
^ it is impossible to guarantee that the problem will not recur , but we do now know enough to be able to identify the rogue fairly quickly . 
^ &name 's initial response to my suggestion that the actual problem should be fixed is fairly encouraging , but it is not the sort of thing that will happen instantly . 
^ the problem is completely unrelated to the recent external attacks .
