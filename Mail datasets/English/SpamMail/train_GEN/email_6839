^ &num questions . 
^ &num ) the exec were asking me yesterday if they will have any jobs to do ( helping out / stewarding etc ) at the event , or whether they 're not needed at all , in which case they will buy tickets and invite friends . 
^ please let me know as soon as you can so i can let them know . 
^ we are all very willing to help if anything at all needs doing though , so just let me know . 
</text_embedded>

^ can i hold on that one until tomorrow when i hope to have a slightly better idea of the stewarding situation ? 
^ i saw &name last night , she has n't been very well for the last couple of weeks and was still rather " under the weather' - do pray for her . 
^ she said that so far , she had &num volunteers to steward- which is n't really enough , although we 're still trying other people ... if any of you on the exec would like to help in this way , and if this would n't prevent your non-c friends from coming , that would really be appreciated- please could you let &name ( rrt25 ) know if that 's poss ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ &num ) we 'll have our last exec meeting before the concert event tomorrow ( mon ) night , so if there 's anything you 'd like us to help with ( from &name ) , anything you 'd like us to discuss or decide , or anything that you 'd like me to update or brief the exec on ( it 'd be especially good to have an update so we all know where everything 's at and can be praying appropriately ) please e-mail me before &name mon night . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name &name should be getting prayer points out to our prayer supports shortly which you should be &name 'd in , so hopefully that 'll be useful for this . 
^ yep- i 'll try to before my supervision this afternoon , though if i do n't manage to do this in time , i wo n't be free again till late this evening- i 'll forward the list of prayer points from our meeting on saturday , in case i do n't get the other &num done in time ... 
<text_embedded> 

^ &num ) i will be looking after &name ( meeting him , bringing him to the right place , praying with him ( and some of you guys as well hopefully ! ) etc. )

^ great , thanks . 
^ we 'll be having a time of prayer on the day , though i 'm yet to work that out . 
^ i suspect that we 're looking at having a prayer meeting around the 4pm-6pm time scale , ie after the afternoon rehearsal and before we have to be getting ready for the concert . 
^ yep , that sounds about right- might be an idea to find a willing &name to
