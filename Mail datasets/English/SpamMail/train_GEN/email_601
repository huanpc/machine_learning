^ &name , friends of &name , and &name . 
^ &name will soon be reaching the illustrious age of &num ( on the 26th of november , for those of you reaching for your diaries ) , and it has been suggested that we celebrate this by going out for a meal . 
^ realistically but unfortunately , the only evening possible that is even vaguely near &name 's actual birthday , is the monday itself . 
^ this is a problem for all die-hard &name fans , and those on the ballroom &name &name . 
^ however , if we go to &name 's for &name &name ( it 's just a name , &name , i 'm not promising any drastic mood enlightenments ) , we could book for 
^ &num 30ish which would leave plenty of time for those wanting to get back for &name . 
^ the rest of us ( or possibly just me and &name , if people do n't want to miss the &name i double act ) could then go on to elsewhere ( to be decided later ) . 
^ if everyone could let me know asap , as i can then either book the meal or have a mad think about another date , that would be great . 
^ if i have n't heard from you by next tuesday , i 'll assume you 're not coming . 
^ unlike most other birthday invitations , this one will not be containing the usual " if i 've forgotton anyone , please forward this email to them " . 
^ &name does n't really like many people ( &name 's only invited on sufferance ) . 
^ thanks for reading this , for hopefully replying and for being special enough people for &name to want to invite you ! 
^ love , &name .
