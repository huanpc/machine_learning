^ i have done a course in prob and &name . 
^ some time ago and need quite a lot of revision . 
^ i can work most derivations okay ( i 'm having some problem with vector derivations though ) . 
^ i was wondering if you could suggest a text book that has some numerical problems which i could attempt so that i can refresh faster . 
^ what book do you recommend in general for the speech &num - &name ? 
^ &name ? 
^ or &name and &name ?

^ &name , 
^ the standard book i recommend is &name , &name and stork . 
^ this is where i get various examples and diagrams from . 
^ do not worry about vector derivatives , these will be covered in the lecture on parameter optimisation .
