^ please note that the test will be a closed book test as in previous years and as stated earlier , but as a concession to fairness those students taking the test tomorrow afternoon , and only those taking the test tomorrow afternoon , may collect a copy of the handout and references for tomorrows lecture today , if they want . 
^ this will give them the opportunity to look at the lecture material before the lecture and the test on tuesday , so as to not unfairly disadvantage them . 
^ i will also start the tuesday afternoon test at &num not &num so as to give those students taking the tuesday test a bit more time to look through their lecture notes . 
^ students taking the test on wednesday morning will be given the handouts with the lecture in the normal way . 
^ any queries see me
