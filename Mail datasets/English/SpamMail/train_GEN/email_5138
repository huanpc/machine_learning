^ dear , 
^ it is surely time we had another &name &name . 
^ we need to decide when , where , and if there is to be any special focus , or invited speaker or anything . 
^ as regards when , early next term would be good . 
^ this would mean sometime after the &num april . 
^ i have no particular suggestions for focus ( or indeed any particular view about whether we need one , but i think the sort of tutorial talk has been a nice feature of previous meetings , and it would be nice to continue it ) . 
^ where ? 
^ &name did it last time , and we have been to &name and &name in the past . 
^ perhaps one of the other locations ? 
^ any suggestions ? 
^ best &name &name &name , &email dept. of language & linguistics , &website university of &name , &name park , &name : &num &num &num ( direct ) &name , &name &name , &name . 
^ &name : &num &num &num
