^ hi &name , 
^ i 've had a really good may week thanks . 
^ &name was brilliant - i have n't danced that much for aaaages , and there was salsa , rock and roll and cheesy pop so all was great ! 
^ my friend and i have decided to go to dancing lessons next term with the club that pigeon hole everyone lots - it should be fun though i fear it may be at the expense of cums &num . 
^ &name , oh well , i ca n't do everything ... i 've got the summer to decide what i 'm doing anyway . 
^ i did work at &name . 
^ it was good fun though i enjoyed &name much more ! 
^ so it was the right way round to do it - working at the first and going to the 2nd . 
^ it was good in that i got to see lots of &name friends all looking lovely , and i would n't have gone to the ball if i had n't been working at it , at least not at &num pounds a ticket ! 
^ if i have to wash up any wine glasses in the near future i 'll not be impressed , however ! 
^ i 've never seen so many glasses all in &num place at the same time ! 
^ they looked well impressive when we 'd lined them all up , clean , in the kitchen though . 
^ i was very proud ( ? ! ) &smiley 
^ it sounds like you 've had a pretty busy may week too . 
^ i 'm glad it 's been fun though . 
^ it 's really cool to be in &name without having loads of work to do . 
^ i ca n't help thinking there must be some huge project or something that i 've forgotten about though . ... 
^ i 'm going to be a nuclear physicist for &num weeks ! ! ! ! 
^ i 'm doing a project at a big international nuclear fusion / plasma physics research place near &name where i live , which should be really interesting . 
^ and my supervisor reckons we might get a paper out of it ... i remain sceptical but very excited ! ! 
^ so that 's what i 'm doing for some of the summer . 
^ apart from that i 'm going youth hostelling in &name with my brother , helping on a children 's camp ( eek , scary ! ! ) , going to &name &name ( yay ! ! ! 
^ 12th-17th august if you 're around - always great fun ! ! ! ! ! ! ) , and helping at holiday club at my &name church . 
^ oh , and there 's a houseparty in there somewhere ... which needs organising . ... 
^ &name sounds like fun . 
^ my french has got very very rusty but i think i can still say bon voyage and a bientot ( yes i know there should be some accents there somewhere but i do n't know how to do them on &name ! ) 
^ have a good summer ,

^ hi ! 
^ sorry , i meant to have a good chat with you yesterday , but things seemed to be rather hectic ! 
^ hope you enjoyed &name event last night . 
^ did you end up working at th &char &name &name &name in the end ? 
^ did n't get along to any &name &name this year but we had the &name event on sunday which was exclusively for &name member &char ( for whom it was free ) and a limited number of their guests . 
^ that was qu ite good , especially for a free event ! 
^ also had quite a lot of garden partie &char over the last few days as well as &num concerts i 've sung in and &num concerts i 've been along to , so alongside organisation for next year 's &name &name concert and various other bits and pieces , it 's been quite a busy may wee &char ! 
^ it 's been great though to catch up with friends who i saw very little of over the exam period and to be able to relax with no pressure of work ! 
^ and we ca n't really complain about the weather overall ( apart from the thunderst orm for &name , &name and &name balls on tuesday morning ! ) . 
^ are you up to much over the summer ? 
^ i 'm assembling a prayer diary for ou &char cu over the long vac , so it 's quite interesting to see the wide range of thi ngs some people are getting up to . 
^ as for me , i 'm hoping to get a job and wo rk over the summer to earn enough money to pay through my financial shortfal &char for next year and hopefully have enough left over to do some extras such as &name houseparty and &char may ball . 
^ it 's local evangelism in the work-place ! 
^ i shall also be going to &name for just under a fortnight with my family &char here we should be doing a fair bit of walking which should be good . 
^ not sure yet where we are going in &name ; my parents may have decided by now , but giv en that we 'll be camping , the decision can be fairly last-minute . 
^ take care and all the best for the summer , 
^ &name 
^ on wednesday &num &name &num &num : &num , you wrote :
