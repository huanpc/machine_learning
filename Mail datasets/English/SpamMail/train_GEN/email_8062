<text_normal> 

^ why thank you .

</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ one of the most problematic things about a &num day break in a random conversation is that ( now ) i also do n't understand pretty much anything you , or especially i , have said . 
^ &name , i 'll have to turn up the randomness instead . 
</text_embedded>

^ oh good . 
^ this should be .. erm .. interesting ? 
^ no. painful , that 's the word .,. . 
<text_embedded> 

^ well , it would be humorous to watch you try and catch me and then break my legs . 
</text_embedded>

^ calling me slow , are you ? 
^ are you possibly forgetting i have a chauffeur now ... ? 
^ &name ... 
^ bring on the pain . 
^ i like 
<text_embedded> 

^ it . 
</text_embedded>

^ you like the pain ? 
^ so .. it 'd be worse for you to deny you your pain ? 
^ hmmm. .. i 'll have to think about that one ... 
^ but then again , it would stop me delivering all 
<text_embedded> 

^ the presents to all the poor little children so i just may have to avoid that . 
</text_embedded>

^ that 's it settled then . 
^ &num broken legs coming up !

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ i need to have more gravitational attraction . 
</text_embedded>

^ for ... ? 
</text_embedded>

^ attracting things . 
^ &name . 
^ spoons and ice-cream would be nice . 
^ attracting the lab to my house would be useful . 
^ unlimited possibilities really . 
</text_embedded>

^ how do you intend to control the ( surely inevitable ) attraction to you of things you * don't * want e.g. sharp , pointy knives , tripe and marmalade sandwiches , neighbouring star systems and ... say ... &name ? 
^ i mean , it 's &num thing for &name to be phyically attracted to you in a * sexual * sense , but do you truly want him to also suffer from an irresistible physical i.e. geographical attraction to you ? 
^ could you really cope with him coming hurtling towards you at velocity &char ( for very large) ... ? 
^ you think about that , &name ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ ok : 
^ &name and marmelade sandwiches ? 
^ &name they sound good .

^ does &name come with tripe ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ true , but i think you 're on the right lines here . 
^ please expand it and bit , prove your hypothesis and you will have a new theory of respectability and the &name do n't forgot to give respect . 
</text_embedded>

^ oh , repsect , respect , by all means , respect . 
^ maximum respect , even . 
^ i 'm just not sure that even * maximum * respect for your ass extends far enough to motivate me to expand my bipartite graph analogy into a full-blown &name . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ what a disrespectful maximum respect you have for my ass . 
^ shame on you ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name - &char ) disappointing , &char ) is n't that a brand of razor ? 
</text_embedded>

^ disappointing how ? 
^ surely it 's better than fabian , which you said yourself was " scary " , if i remember correctly . 
^ and i 've nevere heard of &name razors , but then i 'm no expert , being the hairy minger i am . 
^ &smiley
