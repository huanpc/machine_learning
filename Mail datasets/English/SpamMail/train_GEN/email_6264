^ hi all 
^ thanks to those who agreed to help out with the &name 's formal later this 
^ month . 
^ unfortunately it has now been cancelled , so i 'm no longer in need for volunteers . 
^ they will probably be coming to us sometime in the future , &char &char there will be another opportunity which will be well worth taking . 
^ secondly , i 've been asked to let you all know about the &name cultural missions group ( formally &num : &num ) which is for anyone who is interested ( however vaguely ! ) in cross-cultural work . 
^ the first meeting is this &name day and you 're all welcome to come along and see what it 's all about , with absolutely no commitment whatsoever . 
^ it should be well sign posted once you get to the &name &name &name if you do n't know where &name &name 's &name &char is . 
^ if you do n't know where the &name &name hall is , it 's next to &name &name church .

^ dear all , 
^ i 'm writing to you to tell you about the &name cultural missions group which is starting this term , and to invite you to come for tea on sunday 24th 
^ november at the &name &name &name - &name &name 's office - at &num : &num to find out more about it . 
^ the main aim of the &name is to enable people who are interested in cros &char cultural mission - whether that means in &name or abroad , working for a missionary organisation or as a christian within a secular organisation 
^ to meet up and pray , to focus our thoughts and plans , to think about some of the issues involved , to envision and encourage one another , to explore the specific resources available on cross cultural opportuni ties , to hear speakers who have direct experience in the relevant areas , to put people in contact with people who work in the area they are interested in , where possible . 
^ i hope that it can be very much developed around the specific needs of whoever comes and so will be a very practical and applied encouragement 2e 
^ we will meet only once or twice a term , and hopefully we will have a me &name each time and then pray and talk . 
^ please come along on sunday , and &name g anyone who you think will be interested . 
^ please let me know if you thin k you can come so i have a rough idea how many muffins to buy !
