^ counted any sheep lately ? ^ ( in reference to  ame 's questions ^ - nothing to do with whether you ca n't sleep : in case you were wondering ! ) . ^ had any further developments on the " where is  ame " situation ? ^ could  ame give you any more details ? ? ^ just let me know ! ^ i have my whole family looking out for a dumb-looking raven ( nah - just kidding , although  ame and i have mentioned  ame every time we 've seen a raven ! ) . ^ my scanner is totally cool ! ^ the clarity of reproduction on the screen literally takes  um breath away ( pants ! ) and it is such fun playing round with the pictures on screen . ^ i have a programme whereby you can distort photos and make people 's noses and ears bigger or whatever you fancy . ^  ame stuff : i can see some amusing products ! ! ^ i thought i might set up a website as well and put some of my finished results on it - that would be fun ! ^ seriously though , i may do it and put my sisters wedding photos on , so that members of our family and friends who could n't make it to the wedding can just go online and check them out . ^ i now have the required technology to do it , and as a job seems highly unlikely in the foreseeable future , i may as well make the most of all the spare time i 'll have . ^ just an idea , but watch this space . . . ... ^ bored yet ? ? ^ if you are reading this you have obviously disobeyed my command and stopped watching the above space : how dare you . ^ however , i ca n't blame you . ^ now , what else have i got to say ? ^ oh yes . ^ i was utterly appalled to read that you have started off a mad craze in the scottish borders . ^ little would i have guessed when i first heard of you ,  ame and  ame purchasing your water guns that it would lead to lots of crazy scottish boys in " the  ame " going out and doing the same . ^ you have a lot to answer for . ^ well , actually , i think we could go back further and saw that a certain  ame  ame  ame has a lot to answer for . ^ dear oh dear ! ^ have you had any big showdowns yet ? ? ^ hope you have fun and that you end up soaked ! ^ get someone to get some photographic evidence and i 'll make a poster of it ! ^ actually , having said all that , i must confess that i have a confession to make . ^ i have been very tempted in recent days to go out and purchase a cps500 of my own . ^ you see , we have this problem in our gardens with pigeons . ^ now , personally , i think that pigeons are one of the most revolting creatures that  ame made . ^ there must be a reason for there existence , or  ame would not have made them , but i , blinded by man 's fallen nature , fail to see the delights of the filthy creatures . ^ you have to understand how they behave to fully appreciate why i have this dislike of them . ^ do you get any pigeons near where you live . ^ no i forget , you only have eyes for ravens ! ^ anyway , they hang around in  ame like a horrible disease and have a habit of flying up in your face as you walk along . ^ ooooh i hate it ! ^  ame  ame , bracelet ! ^ well , i really find them annoying , and they have taken to coming into our garden and pecking round the flower beds below the bird feeder . ^ as a result they are frightening away all of our lovely bluetits and green  ame . ^ so , i have been thinking of ways of getting rid of them . ^ stones are  um option , but i am a bad aim and am not convinced that it is either necessary nor nice to physically damage one of the wretched birds if i actually aimed right . ^ so , i have resorted to water : bucketfuls doused over mangy birds is quite effective , but not as practical as a gun . ^ so , there we have it . ^ i may end up buying a water gun after all . ^ my goodness ! ^ i did n't realise i could talk for so long about pigeons ! ^ i rather wonder if the particular  um that return time and time again to our garden are perhaps like  ame : from another dimension and sent here to bemuse and confound us lowly and ignorant human beings . ^ i doubt it somehow . . ... ^ well , preparations for the wedding are hotting up . ^ we went to the florists today and got flowers for decorating the church and reception . ^ they are extortionately expensive ! ^ all the palava about this wedding has made me determine that mine will be a nice simple affair . ^ in fact , if i can trick anyone into marrying me , i shall probably insist upon eloping ! ^ wedding preparations are so mental . ^ we have had that many disagreements this week that i am surprised we are still a family ! ^ however , it is all coming together now . ^ we have a rehersal thingy tomorrow ( to know where we are meant to stand etc ) and are going to  ame  ame ( where the reception is going to be ) in the evening to sort out the flower arrangements and set up the cake . ^ i must say , i have spent a lot of time recently wondering about traditions . ^ why do we have to have cakes piled on top of each other ? ^ why  ame confetti over the bride and groom ? ^ ( although my dad says he 's not allowing any of that as he 'll have to sweep the church path clean afterwards , and he ca n't be bothered ! ) . ^ about your scripture union camp . ^ is that with  ame by any chance ? ^ i guess it is as she was telling me about them . ^ i hope you have a good time there . ^ and  ame , what has happened to you . ^ i quote : " i 'm noticing how chilly it is " ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ^  ame ! ! ^ this is the guy who only feels the heat . ^ do you know what this all means ? ^ it means you are turning into a southerner ( southern as in  ame  ame , not as in just  ame ) ! ^ shock horror . ^ however , i do congratulate you , as you are now showing signs of being a normal human being ! ^ well , i have waffled now for far too long , so i shall sign off . ^ bye for now , have fun from  ame ^  ame ,  ame , shine ! ^ fill this land with the father 's glory . ^  ame ,  ame ,  ame ! ^ set our hearts on fire . ^  ame , river , flow ! ^  ame the nations with grace and mercy . ^ send forth your word ,  ame , and let there be light ! ^  ame : i hope you noticed that all my sentances began with  um spaces . ^ you are most welcome . ^ also please note that this e-mail is very long -  um words in fact . ^ 'sometimes i wonder just how wonderful  um person can be " . ^ bye ! ^ the grammatical princess . ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
