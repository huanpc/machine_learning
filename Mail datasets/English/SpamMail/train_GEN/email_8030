^ lightweight . 
^ what 's wrong with &num hour days , eh ? 
^ &name does it ! 
</text_embedded>

^ yes , well . 
^ remember what i said about not deserving a zillion pound a week if you do n't take * any * sickdays ? 
^ &name proved . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'm not really sure i follow your logic . 
^ but it sounds good anyway ... 
<text_embedded> 

^ besides i had another thrilling night working down da pub waiting for me . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name slave to the system ...

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name . 
^ but .. how can i phrase this ... if i was trying to build a mnetal picture of someone i 'd never met , asking if they can fly , * wouldn't * be the first thing i 'd ask . 
^ do you see where i 'm coming from ? 
</text_embedded>

^ his physical characteristics would be radically different if he could fly and did have wings - so i think its a valid question . 
^ what would your first question be ? 
</text_embedded>

^ first of all , just &name he can fly does n't mean he has to have wings . 
^ or that are visible from day to day , or whatever . 
^ and secondly ... you 're weird . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ but i do have a tiny , yet smart and perfectly formed arse . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name burgers . 
</text_embedded>

^ they can be rather nice . 
^ &name tells me you can get a double bacon veggie burger at &name &name these days . 
^ &name . 
</text_embedded>

^ just quit with the whole veggie thing - meat can be soooooo good . 
^ i want meeeeeeat . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name * can * be so good . 
^ but so can potatoes . 
^ i want taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatties ... 
</text_embedded>

^ how about meat and potatos . 
^ oh yeesssssss ! ! 
^ i want meat and spuds . 
^ now . 
^ you 're late ... 
^ i 've eaten my packed lunch already . 
^ d'oh ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ speaking of burgers ( ad &name , for that matter ) , his new catchphrase is " i 'm really just a sensitive special burger' . 
^ hmmm. .. i 'll leave him to explain that one , i think . 
</text_embedded>

^ that sounds just like &name . 
^ was this after &num pints ? 
</text_embedded>

^ a few more than that actually . 
^ housewarming / &name 's birthday at &num &name on monday . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ more than &num pints ! 
^ &name ? 
^ was he trying to pull &name in front of &name ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

^ and just how can i prove that i did n't cry ... ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ see , you ca n't . 
^ hence , by contradiction you did and i will feel bad for the rest of my life &name i made you cry

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &char ) you did n't answer my question ! 
</text_embedded>

^ my mam would probably say ... 'do n't listen to a word that &name boy says : he attacked me with a set of sharp keys upon first meeting me . " just a guess , but i think quite accurate . 
</text_embedded>

^ hell , i 've apologised a * thousand * times for that and she still holds it against me ? 
^ it was a simple case of misidentification , and i 'm gonna have to be reeeaaal careful here so might just shut up . 
</text_embedded>

^ &name ha ... you 're on her death list ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal>
