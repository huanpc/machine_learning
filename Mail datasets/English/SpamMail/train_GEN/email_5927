^ dear all , 
^ how can i get the color management working in &name &num on &name &num ? 
^ i 've been following all the advices in the documentation , &name and &name are installed properly and working , and i found " &name " after compilation . 
^ i have installed the lcms with 'make install " , and have run ldconfig afterwards . 
^ lprof-1.09 itself is runnig fine . 
^ do you have any hints ?

^ after installing lcms you need icc profiles in the profiles directory . 
^ on my system , which is the scribus default : /usr / local / lib / scribus / profiles is where i have installed my profiles ( as root ) 
^ you should have at minimum , an &name profile for you monitor , an &name profile for conversion and a &name profile for a printer . 
^ i highly recommend installing these : &website as a base set of profiles for using color management . 
^ with this set of profiles , this should enable &name in &name - otherwise this preferences will not appear . 
^ &name this helps , &name &name &name ( &email )
