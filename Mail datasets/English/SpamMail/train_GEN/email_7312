^ &name , here 's a message from &name &name ( 4th yr physicist)- he 's going about setting up a &name for people inthe west &name site , it was originally going to be just phys , but the idea now seems to be to have a fortnightly prayer meeting for all west &name people , then other things in the individual faculties will prob come out of it ... 
^ anyway , if you happen to be around at &num today ... ( read message ) otherwise , get in touch with &name if you 'd like to be kept informed of what 's going on- his email 's &name . 
^ see you later , &name 
^ hi everyone , 
^ in order to get things off the ground and generally exchange ideas , we will try to get to together this week , but since there does n't seem to be a common time , i suggest , 
^ thursday 11.15am and friday &name 
^ in the &name cafe place on the corner of &name road and &name &name avenue ( the one out north from the &name car park past the &name building on the right ) . 
^ hopefully most of you will be able to make one of these times . 
^ please pass this on to anyone else as appropriate . 
^ first and second years - if you have practicals on these days then do come along , otherwise , maybe you can get together amongst yourselves or let me know what your thoughts are . 
^ cheers , 
^ &name
