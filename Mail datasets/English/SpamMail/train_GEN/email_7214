^ hi &name , thanks for sending out that reminder- and for doing our report ! 
^ ca n't quite remember , did you say i 'm chairing , or would you like to if you 're getting &name to minute it ? 
^ &char really do n't mind either way , just let me know ... 
^ i saw &name tonight , he 's coming , but will probably arrive at a similar time to me ( ie 11ish ) and has to leave around &num . 
^ so would be an idea to have the exec report earlyish i think ... what have you decided about the schedule ? 
^ ok , thanks again , see you tomorrow &smiley love &name ps how was rev ? 
^ i was sorry to have missed it , but had a good time anyway and managed to catch up with people i had n't seen for a while , so that was good .
