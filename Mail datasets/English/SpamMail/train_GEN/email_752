^ hi &name , 
^ did you get my text messages ? 
^ cool ! 
^ what did you think of &name 's voyager leaflet ? 
^ cool ! 
^ what did you think of &name 's e-mail about &name ? 
^ scandalous ! 
^ anyway , as you may have guessed , i went down to see the flat yesterday . 
^ i had a great day and saw &name too . 
^ i think the bedrooms all need a coat of paint . 
^ the rest of the flat is optional . 
^ we have acquired ( do n't ask me how ! ) an ironing board and a tv table which are not in the official inventory . 
^ there were no letters for you in the post box . 
^ have we decided finally on bedroom allocation ? 
^ if it 's what i think it is then &name 's smells of smoke . 
^ most of the curtains do n't match . 
^ in the living area there are &num darkish blue &num seater settees . 
^ the fridge has a minor defect . 
^ we have a telephone socket ! ! ! 
^ it 's in the hall and there is a telephone ( extremely old , disgusting , dirty , unhygienic , will be disposed of as soon as i remember the rubber gloves type ) but the line is not connected . 
^ the little intercom system with the front door is fun ! 
^ &name and i played around with it for a while . 
^ we need air freshener musty smell in most areas . 
^ no bed linen , duvets , pillows etc. are provided . 
^ there are no headboards on the beds , which are thick metal and extremely ugly i 'll be bringing a valance . 
^ the toilet makes a noise like an aeroplane taking off . 
^ ( at least it 's not an elephant trumpeting this year ! ) the windows are quite nice . 
^ there is a cool little spy-hole in the flat door &name and i played with that too . 
^ the flat address is ; &name &char , &name &name 's &name , &name , &name 4ds . 
^ the electricity works by a meter . 
^ there is an electronic key which must be taken down to a power shop and recharged in return for money . 
^ there is &pound; &num left in our meter . 
^ most flats use &pound; &num per week , so we 're rather lucky . 
^ we also went to college in search of &name 's shirts . 
^ &num is basically a builder 's yard ! 
^ the floors are up , etc unfortunately we could n't find the shirts , but they may be in a lock-up so do n't give up hope yet ! 
^ i also went to the natwest bank and enquired about flat accounts . 
^ &name . 
^ we shall need to discuss that nearer the time . 
^ basically we need &num other person to operate it . 
^ anyway , i 'm off on holiday early saturday morning . 
^ e-mail silence for nearly &num weeks how awful ! 
^ hope your job is going well . 
^ hope your family is well . 
^ will hear from you soon hopefully . 
^ yours in the &name &name ,
