^ hi &name , i 'm actually coming back to &name on sunday - a week early for &name as i 've got &name &name and am an ill &name ! 
^ &name is a nightmare here at the moment , as the network rarely lets us get online for it , it 's such a pain ! ! 
^ i leave for &name on the 23rd of august , and the doctors have said i need to have at least &num weeks bed rest , but july i should be free , we 'll have to go out for a meal or something ! 
^ i 'm really looking forward to seeing you again , you can tell me all about &name , and i can let you know about good old &name , and also about &name ( which i am very excited about ! ) . 
^ i 'll email you soon , and once i 've rested a bit at home , lets go and get lunch ! ! 
^ lots of love , &name &char
