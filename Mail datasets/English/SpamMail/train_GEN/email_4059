^ hi , &name ! 
^ wonderful to hear from you again ! 
^ we figured it was the rigors of school that kept you from corresponding . 
^ fun to read about your adventures with the &name ! 
^ glad to hear that you had a great celebration on your birthday . 
^ i hope our card made it to you in time . 
^ we 're finally enjoying spring here -- my daffodils are out and there should be leaves on the trees in the upcoming weeks . 
^ ( i know , i know , you 've had flowers and such for months , but we 're excited here ! ) the boys are doing well in school and are off on various field trips this month . 
^ &name 's 89-year-old mum , though , is doing poorly . 
^ she went into the hospital with another bout of congestive heart failure last friday and was only discharged yesterday . 
^ &name was in &name with her from friday until monday night and his sister , &name , has flown up from &name to be with her now . 
^ &name also decided to cancel his 10-day trip to &name -- he was supposed to teach a week-long course in &name next week , but was afraid he 'd be called back here , due to his mum 's condition . 
^ so that has been postponed till later in the year . 
^ it 's not easy getting old ! 
^ otherwise we 're doing well and hope that your last few weeks are not too trying . 
^ keep us posted on your post-graduation plans . 
^ take care &name , &name and the gang &smiley

^ hello friends ! 
^ i realise that i have been rather silent over the last few months , and this , believe it or not , is quite heavily due to my final year workness of university , although work is not the only distraction from writing to you . 
^ exams , projects , urgh ! 
^ at the moment , the exams are rather looming , but only &num weeks until they are finished ! 
^ then my formal education is finished ! 
^ ( how scary . ) 
^ the queen 
^ hm the &name is in &name today , and so security is very intense . 
^ as the &name was going to drive up the &name , which is the main street in &name , there were lots of crowds on either side of the road . 
^ a friend ; &name , and i decided that we would walk down the &name to see what it was like at the other end , and before we knew it , there were huge crowds on either side of us , separated from us by police . 
^ so we walked on , loving every minute of it ! 
^ and because we were walking confidently , the police did n't even challenge us ! 
^ we got all the way to the market place before we were told that we really should n't be in the road , so we turned around and walked all the way back up the police-guarded path through the people . 
^ i think i would do well at being famous ! 
^ there is a tutor named &name at my college who is canadian , and i have become friends with him and particularly his &num year old son over the last term . 
^ anyway , the &name was going for lunch at the &name , and &name and his family were standing at the gate of the castle , with canadian flags and waiting there . 
^ i was behind the barriers like everyone else . 
^ then &name 's wife waved at me and beckoned for me to come and stand with them ! 
^ so i went over , got past the first policemen , and then the last one said that i could n't go if i did n't have a flag . 
^ grrr. that was so unfair . 
^ the &name talked to that family for almost a minute ! 
^ grrr. 
^ my birthday 
^ oh well , enough about the &name . 
^ my 21st birthday was absolutely brilliant ! 
^ i realised just how blessed i was with a great family and wonderful friends , and that was probably a good thing to realise . 
^ for my birthday party i had a canadian pancake and icecream party - if you 've never tried pancakes and icecream together , do ! 
^ it works ! 
^ ( even better with smarties on the top . 
^ my future 
^ i 'm not sure what i 'll be doing next year . 
^ i hope to be staying here in &name to do a phd in &num digital mapping , which would pretty much involve running around the countryside with expensive technology for &num years . 
^ i just need to find the funding for that , as my project suffered a funds cut - ie they took away all the funding ! 
^ oh dear ! 
^ &name , i really had better go and do some more revision ! 
^ this break has been longer than i intended it to be ! 
^ lots of love ,
