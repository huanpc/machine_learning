^ hi , &name &name the blues treasurer sent me this to forward to all of you . 
^ could ppl please read it ? 
^ the game today has been cancelled as one of the teams could n't make it , but wo n't be penalising anyone . 
^ i am going a bit insane from receiving emails and emails , and ppl complaining about exactly what i 'm complaining about . 
^ i 'm not sure i see a solution either . 
^ would ppl be ok with maybe meeting up for a coffee and discussing whatever thoughts all together and i 'll then get them across to the blues ? 
^ i suggest meet at 4pm at &name coffee place on sunday , on &name street , in case anyone does n't know where it is . 
^ this sunday 19th january . 
^ so if you have any strong opinions on the change which most ppl seem to have come along or get someone from your team to come . 
^ see you there , &name 
^ dear all , 
^ concerning the new timetable for the league , the booking of the court for the present season was made last year by members of last year 's commitee . 
^ no one else was informed and so no one knew anything before the beginning of this week when we got the &name invoice . 
^ i 've called to &name already and they do n't have any regular slot free ( they have random hours even more weird than those in the invoice ) . 
^ i will keep an eye on them in case they have any team cancelling slots . 
^ the timetable might have changed on the base of complaints / non-avaibility of the court , honestly , i have no clue ... i know this might be inconvenient for some people but there are no many matches left and it is probably just &num hour per week ( per team ) . 
^ to avoid this happening again , i will keep you posted about stuff made for next season . 
^ take care , 
^ &name
