^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your &char and passing on the arran &char reunion details . 
^ it sounds like fun and i might even be able to make it - wow ! 
^ sorry not to have seen you yesterday . 
^ i slipped out the back to &name biscuits with the freshers , which was good fun . 
^ we had &num from &name , plus a few who could n't make it yesterday but should be there usually . 
^ it 's all very exciting really . 
^ we 've had quite a lot of interest in ce too which is really cool . 
^ anyway , my summer was good thanks . 
^ the 2nd stint of my placement was better than the first as i knew what i was doing a bit more . 
^ i 've been askd back next year which has got to be a good thing ! 
^ &name survivor was brilliant - i met &name , a fresher at &name , there so that was very exciting ! 
^ she 's really cool and came to &name 's with me today which was nice . 
^ we had a student lunch as a one off , and that was very good . 
^ previously &name 's has been a bit wary of getting students involved with stuff as we 're only around half the year , so this lunch was very encouraging and they seem much more enthusiastic about the large number of students who attend now ! 
^ how are lectures going ? 
^ are you enjoying compsci ( you strange mad person ... but then i ca n't really comment , can i ? ! ) ? 
^ &name has been great so far - i 've understood all my lectures ! ! 
^ admittedly the first maths &num was mainly about how to add complex numbers ... hmm , not the most challenging maths ever but i guess it 's important ... 
^ anyway , see you soon . 
^ are you going on tues ? 
^ i may see you there . 
^ &name
