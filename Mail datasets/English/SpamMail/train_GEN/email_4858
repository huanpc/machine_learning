^ map , &name , &name , and group by all allow different tuple description outputs than input ( so that would be the majority of boxes ) . 
^ however , i think in all these cases the output tuple description can be calculated from the function parameters without having to ask the user . 
^ i am not sure how you implemented functions , but in our pseudo-code each function had a getreturntype ( ) method . 
^ thus the output type of the map &name is the concatenation of each of the return types of the functions given to the map &name .

^ hey box people , &name got a few quick questions about type specification : is a map box allowed to have different input and output types ? 
^ and do the majority of the boxes we 're implementing allow the output type to be different from the input type . 
^ i know for a filter box the input type must be the same as the output type and for a restream i think the user would have to specify both an input and an output type , but will most of the other boxes we will be implementing require the user to specify just an input type or both an input and an output type ? 
^ thanks
