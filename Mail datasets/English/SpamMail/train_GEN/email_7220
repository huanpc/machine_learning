^ dear &name , 
^ i had a bad vibe that you are unwell . 
^ i sent you more than &num email asking for your status . 
^ of late , i have had no feedback from you at all regarding the project . 
^ however , i saw that the &name page has been updated . 
^ other group members were really worried about you and were desperate to get in touch with you , not only because your contribution to the project is crucial at this stage , but also because no one has heard from you in a while.your .plan file indicated quite a lot of free time this afternoon , we were expecting you to come to the group meeting . 
^ please can you get back to the group about this . 
^ an email to the group would probably help . 
^ i also suggest you get in touch with tara immediately and split up tasks interms of modules that you have to test . 
^ module testing is one of the deliverables for tuesday 's deadline . 
^ many thanks ! 
^ &name .
