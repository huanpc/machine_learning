^ i just thought you 'd be interested to know that i am now the worlds expert on the strontium isotope budget of the oceans . 
^ the oceans are best described by a closed box system where the main inputs of strontium isotope ratios are from weathering of continental rocks ( positive ) and from sea water altered by hydrothermal processes at mid ocean ridges ( negative) . 
^ by looking at the variation in the strontium istope ratio over the years we notice a increase &num million years ago indicating an increase in the amount of strontium brought down by rivers from continental weathering . 
^ this coincides with some major orogenies - the main &num being the formation of the &name which would also increase the amount of continental weathering . 
^ increased erosion also has an impact on the carbon cycle as erosion of silicate minerals draws down &name . 
^ therefore strontium isotopes record the uplift of land and from this we can infer the factors affecting the carbon cycle at that time . 
^ now you too are an expert in strontium isotopes - or you would be if you read the above text properly which you most probably did n't do . 
^ if there are any questions on the topic please free to ask me myself and &name you can most probably tell that i 've had too much coffee again . 
^ oh dear &smiley 
^ love &name ( just in case you could n't work it out ) xxx
