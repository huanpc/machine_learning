^ &name ! 
^ of course i remember you - all those evenings spent up the tree in our garden - how could i forget ! ! ! 
^ i have a lot of memories from those days ; let me try and think of some of them : 
^ we played endless games of 40-40-in , with the lamp-post outside the &name 's house as the " base " . 
^ i also remember playing a game called " creep " quite a bit . 
^ we also did lots of street football and cricket of course , using &name &name 's gate as the goal / wicket . 
^ do you still support &name ? ? 
^ we spent a fair amount of time down in the " undercroft " under our house i think - we played a number of kissing-related games down there as far as i remember ! 
^ and then of course there was " the tree " . 
^ we each had our own " perches " and we had categorised about &num different branches with varying levels , depending on how difficult it was to sit on them ! 
^ i remember &name being absolutely fearless , and falling out of the tree a number of times while attempting to reach a ridiculously tiny outlying branch ! 
^ also , do you remember making this greenish potion in the holes in the tree after it had rained ? 
^ &num day for some reason we had a large pile of branches outside on our driveway , and we had great fun trying to walk over then without falling through . 
^ i also remember that you were always allowed to stay out later than us ! 
^ do you remember our obsession with &name &name and " &name " ( or however you 're supposed to spell it ! ) ? 
^ well , i think i could go on for quite a long time actually , but i 'll leave it there for the moment . 
^ hope you 're well &name , 
^ &name
