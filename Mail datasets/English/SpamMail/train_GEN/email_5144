^ &name &name , i have n't been able to push the change to the other machines . 
^ we have a master copy of the things in opt , and it is periodically distributed to all the relevant machines . 
^ so i need to change the master copy first - but i ca n't because &name has it locked and he has n't responded to my request to unlock it . 
^ thus the changes i made on tweety will be overwritten with the old files when the master copy is next distributed . 
^ i 'll have to chase him on monday &smiley
