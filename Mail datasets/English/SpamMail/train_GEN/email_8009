^ &name &name , if you do n't remember me try and think back to that dark period in your life you worked for a man named &name &name &name &name and someone talked to you about this terrible game over a table with repulsive food and then once took you to throw bread ( and olives ) at ducks near &name after eating some ( bought ) cheese .. enough of this sad history . 
^ apart from wanting to know how you 're doing over there in newhall , still hanging out with mad vodka infused polish ( synonymous really ? ) guys cycling miles to get midnight snacks ? 
^ also you must be worrying a bit about exams , trying to get that mark above that friend of yours you competed with .. no telling him wrong facts on the day of the exam ! ! 
^ anyway .. what &char want from you is a little favour which you 'll probably say no to but its worth a try : will you model for a " sports " magazine i 'm organizing ? 
^ hehe .. no kidding .. you can do it though if you want .. but what &char need is something a lot more exciting : do you still have the code for the legendary " &name the digital logic &name " ? 
^ yes , i 'm doing a phd here at &name &name and find that really usefull - must be all the tea that went into it ! 
^ anyway , you going to any events in may week ? 
^ see ya , &name &name
