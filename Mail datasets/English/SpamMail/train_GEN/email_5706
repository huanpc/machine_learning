^ dear &name , 
^ i did not give you instructions on how to set up jetty , the &name server . 
^ therefore , it is not necessary for the tick to change the &name pages , only the &name should be plausible . 
^ if you , however , would like to know if your solution is right , please do send it to me and i will test it for you . 
^ thanks . 
^ &name .
