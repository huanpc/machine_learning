"  ame formally , symmetric processes are those for which faithfulness is relevant ; asymmetric processes are those for which faithfulness is irrelevant . ^ this talk will discuss -- among other topics -- a typology of consonant epenthesis , and coronal neutralization in the nepalese language  ame . </text_normal></message_body></message>
