^ hi there ! 
^ i doubt that you remember me , but i contacted you a while back for help with the batchrun feature . 
^ it works great , btw . 
^ since then , i have been using &name maker to pack all my downloads , and i am very happy with it ! 
^ in fact , i 'm so happy with the results i decided to work on repacking all my older files using &name . 
^ i have a lot of friends that also distribute desktop themes , various skins , screensavers , etc. and i have recommended your program several times . 
^ they loved it , too ! 
^ but they also sent me lots of questions about how to use the batchrun feature . 
^ the batchrun feature is important when you are packing desktop themes because most of us usually like to include fonts and sometimes screensavers , which go to different directories than the theme elements . 
^ also , it is &website file pops up on the desktop ( it really helps cut down on our technical support since the directions are right there in front of the enduser ) . 
^ since i received a few e-mails from fellow theme authors that needed help using the batchrun feature , i decided to write &num short tutorials ( for skin and theme authors ) that help guide them through creating &name files using the batchrun feature ( as well as the chicon feature ) . 
^ i thought you might be interested in adding these links to your support page . 
^ &website this tutorial will take you step-by-step through packing a desktop theme , &website file . 
^ the end result will be an exe file that will self-install the theme and font , plus pop up your readme file on the desktop . 
^ &website this tutorial will take you step-by-step through packing skins with &name . 
^ general instructions are available , plus more specific instructions for packing &name &name &name , &name skins , &name toolbar wallpaper , and &name skins .
