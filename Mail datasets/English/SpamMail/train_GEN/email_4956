^ i am wondering if these should really be completely invisible to the user . 
^ &num reasons could be : 
^ &num ) the user wants to &name on the system timestamp &num ) we said that the elements that went into making stream id would be passed along into the system . 
^ however , aggregate boxes remove these extraneous attributes and just pass along the different type of group-by attributes . 
^ so we still have the problem of undescriptive numbers being generated by these aggregate boxes . 
^ this is actually another argument for why the stream id maybe should n't just be a number . 
^ &name
