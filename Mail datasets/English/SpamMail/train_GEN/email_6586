^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : &name &name for &name information service ( q327696 ) &name : &num october &num &name : &name information service impact : &num vulnerabilities , the most serious of which could enable applications on a server to gain system-level privileges . 
^ &name &name : moderate bulletin : ms02-062 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d this patch is a cumulative patch that includes the functionality of all security patches released for &name &num since &name &name &num service pack &num , and all security patches released to date for &name &num and &num . 
^ &char complete listing of the patches superseded by this patch is provided below , in the section titled " additional information about this patch " . 
^ before applying the patch , system administrators should take note of the caveats discussed in the same section . 
^ in addition to including previously released security patches , this patch also includes fixes for the following newly discovered security vulnerabilities affecting &name &num , &num and / or 
^ &num &num : 
^ - a privilege elevation vulnerability affecting the way isapis are launched when an &name &num , &num or &num server is configured to run them out of process . 
^ by design , the hosting process ( &website ) should run only in the security context of the iwam_computername account ; however , it can actually be made to acquire localsystem privileges under certain circumstances , thereby enabling an &name to do likewise . 
^ - a denial of service vulnerability that results because of a flaw in the way &name &num and &num allocate memory for webdav requests . 
^ if a webdav request were malformed in a particular way , &name would allocate an extremely large amount of memory on the server . 
^ by sending several such requests , an attacker could cause the server to fail . 
^ - a vulnerability involving the operation of the script source access permission in &name &num . 
^ this permission operates in addition to the normal read / write permissions for a virtual directory , and regulates whether scripts , &name files and executable file types can be uploaded to a write-enabled virtual directory . 
^ &char typographical error in the table that defines the file types subject to this permission has the effect of omitting .com files from the list of files subject to the permission . 
^ as a result , a user would need only write access to upload such a file . 
^ - a pair of cross-site scripting ( &name ) vulnerabilities affecting &name &num , &num and &num , and involving administrative web page . 
^ each of these vulnerabilities have the same scope and effect : an attacker who was able to lure a user into clicking a link on his web site could relay a request containing script to a third-party web site running &name , thereby causing the third-party site 's response ( still including the script ) to be sent to the user . 
^ the script would then render using the security settings of the third-party site rather than the attacker 's. 
^ in addition , the patch causes &num and &num to change how frequently the socket backlog list - which , when all connections on a server are allocated , holds the list of pending connection requests - is purged . 
^ the patch changes &name to purge the list more frequently in order to make it more resilient to flooding attacks . 
^ the backlog monitoring feature is not present in &name &num . 
^ mitigating factors : &name out of &name &name &name : 
^ - this vulnerability could only be exploited by an attacker who already had the ability to load and execute applications on an affected web server . 
^ normal security practices recommend that untrusted users not be allowed to load applications onto a server , and that even trusted users " applications be scrutinized before allowing them to be loaded . 
^ webdav denial of service : 
^ - the vulnerability does not affect &name &num , as &name is not supported in this version of &name . 
^ - the vulnerability could only be exploited if the server allowed webdav requests to be levied on it . 
^ the &name &name &name 
^ ( &website ) , if deployed in its default configuration , disables such requests . 
^ &name &name &name &name : 
^ - the vulnerability could only be exploited if the administrator had granted all users write and execute permissions to &num or more virtual directories on the server . 
^ &name configurations of &name would be at no risk from this vulnerability . 
^ - the vulnerability does not affect &name &num , as &name is not supported in this version of &name . 
^ - the vulnerability could only be exploited if the server allowed webdav requests to be levied on it . 
^ the &name &name &name , if deployed in its default configuration , disables such requests . 
^ &name scripting in &name administrative pages : 
^ - the vulnerabilities could only be exploited if the attacker could entice another user into visiting a web page and clicking a link on it , or opening an &name mail . 
^ - by default , the pages containing the vulnerability are restricted to local &name address . 
^ as a result , the vulnerability could only be exploited if the client itself were running &name .
