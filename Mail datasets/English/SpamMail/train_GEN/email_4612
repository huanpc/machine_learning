^ hi &name , 
^ &name question : do you think i should throw away the " to " and " from " header information ? 
^ - clearly it cannot be used without serious anonymisation , but the question is whether it is possible to do that robustly and actually retain any useful information at all . 
^ i.e. saving &website " might &website " might be quite personal . 
^ i think this such information will probably have to be discarded . 
^ cheers ,
