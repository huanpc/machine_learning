^ - yes , i am . ^ it is a bit weird though , coz i 've been by myself quite a bit as mam and dad have been busy working , and  ame has been at school . ^ i 'm looking forward to  ame coming home next saturday . ^ life here in  ame seems quite different - even though my flat is still all here . ^ - well , i 'm not there , am i ? ? ^ has to be different ! ^ how was  ame  ame before you left ( i am assuming you left for home today ) . ^ do n't you think he 's cute . ^ i suppose he appeals more to girls than boys . ^ yesterday i went christmas shopping . . . . . ... it was pretty much disastrous , and i ended up buying  ame and  ame a water filter , a blender and some brass light-switch covers ! ^ - you looney ! ^ who wants brass light-switch covers ? ? ? ! ! ! ^ . . ... as it was closing time i just flicked randomly to a page and bought an item there . ^ - oh , right ! ^ the ideal way to choose a present for someone . ^ i guess if the page had opened at something equally random the poor girls would have ended up with pillow cases or  ame tools ! ^ this morning our flat had a christmas breakfast , which was most enjoyable . ^ - sounds like fun ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ last night  ame and i watched "  um things i hate about you " ( a film ) . ^ this morning we watched "  ame  ame  um " </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ ( another film , but a much , much better one ! ) . ^ - i take it the 1st was borrowed from  ame . ^ bit american high school cheesy and sleazy type of film , do n't you think - although parts of it are ok . ^  ame  ame  um is , as you say , much better . ^ this evening our whole flat are going out to the  ame 's for dinner . ^ - i ca n't imagine  ame and  ame being too chuffed with that : the whole flat ? ? ^ doubt they 'd find the doors , carpets , chairs , tables , beds . . . . . . ... very welcome guests . ^ seriously though , hope you had fun ! ^ i hope i 'm not boring you . ^ - tremendously ! ^ no , thank 's  ame ! ^ i like getting emails ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ however , i may have some news on the q. situation . ^ now , this is totally top secret * okay ? ? ? ^ -  ame has an </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ effigy of  ame undergoing an effervation in his room ! ^ * well ? ! ? ! ^ is that not an entirely startling piece of news ? ^ also * get this * it squawks ! ^ i 'll try and send you a  ame photo of it tomorrow . ^ - intriguing ! ! ! ^ mmnnnnn . . . . . ... thought i 'd let you see the weird punctuation your computer seems to specialise in. cunning . . . . ... ^ oh , also , do you have  ame instant messaging service on your computer ? ^ - no. if you do n't, and want to get it , then you can download it from the internet . ^ - sounds good , but i 'm not getting it . ^ i have to use dad 's computer to access the net , and i do n't want him chatting to my friends whenever a random box appears ! ^ i might consider it if i had my computer linked up , but i left my connecting wire in the flat . ^ pants ! ^ oh , i 'm not supposed to say that . ^ back in a moment when i 've washed my mouth out with soap . . . . . . . . . . . ...  ame ! ^ please write back so that i can have something to talk about . ^ - to who ? ^ to yourself ? ^ to me ? ^ i sincerely hope not to others . ^ that would verge on the sin of gossip now , would n't it ! ! ^ ( ha , ha -  ame style laugh ) . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ also , sorry that this has not been an amusing e-mail - they may follow ! ^ - oh , well , it was amusing enough ! ^ so ,  ame . ^ are you home yet ? ^ hope you enjoyed your extra time at  ame . ^ how cold is it in  ame ? ^ it is freezing here in  ame . ^ you probably wo n't believe me , but when i got back on wednesday , i could even notice a difference from the temp in  ame ! ^ so , what have i been up to ? ^ mmmmnnnn . . . . . . . ... ^ when i got back on wed , we dumped ( literally ) my stuff in the house and then went into town and met  ame at the opticians . ^ she was getting some new contact lenses . ^ me and mam went and had a look at cameras , and , guess what ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ^ - i got one . ^  ame ! ^ it is really lush - a canon  ame  um with a 28-90mm lense . ^ very swish . ^ we got it at a bit of a bargain price too , as  ame in  ame had it on special offer -  ound;  um cheaper than  ame 's, who are usually the cheapest . ^ it is so exciting ( i 'll have to tell  ame ! ) , but i 'm not opening it until christmas day . ^ spent the rest of wed feeling very dopey and watching 'message in a bottle " ( a film ( ! ) ) . ^ spent the whole of thursday sorting out my stuff ( very slowly ! ) . ^ yesterday , mam was at work in the morning , and i spent the whole morning asleep in bed . ^ i did n't wake up until  um ! ^ how scandalous ! ! ^ well , it just proves that i 'm tired ( i am not lazy ) after a long term . ^ in the afternoon , we went to the airport with dad to get some flight tickets for him for next week . ^ he is flying down to  ame ( he 's sick of the trains ) for a conference . ^ then we went shopping at the metrocentre and got a wedding present for my cousin who is getting married soon , and got some food ( mmmnnn ...  ame and  ame ! ! ) . ^ then , last night , i made some more cards . ^ this morning we ( me and mam ) went to  ame  ame ( a national trust place ) and had a walk int he grounds and then went to  ame . ^ i wanted to geta ginger bread man from the bakey there , but got there to find that they are doing ginger bread 'santas " instaed , and at double the price ! ^  ame , did n't bother with them . ^ got a  ame instead ! ^ then we came home , had lunch , and now i 'm writing emails ! ^ so , that brings me up to date . ^ hope you have a fun weekend and do n't get too cold . ^ better go now as dad wants the computer ! ^ bye for now ,  ame ^ get more from the web . ^ free  ame explorer download :  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
