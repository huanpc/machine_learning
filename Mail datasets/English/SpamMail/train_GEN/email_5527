^ dear all 
^ i have recieved the &name cards now . 
^ these will be distributed in your pigeon holes today . 
^ you need to fill in your details on the card and affix a passport sized photograph . 
^ then return it to me ( in my pigeon hole ) as it needs to be stamped ! 
^ it will not be valid unless it is stamped so please do n't stick the clear sticky cover bit down .
