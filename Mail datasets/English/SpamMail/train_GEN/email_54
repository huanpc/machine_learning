^ &name &name ! 
^ + below is the list i have of all the people competing saturday and sunday . 
^ + sorry if i have spelt your name wrong ! 
^ + as you can see , there are lots of gaps ( in the women 's team especially ) . 
^ if you can fill any ( or find anyone else who can ) just turn up and go for it ! 
^ + try and come along before your event starts ( obviously ) but at least &num minutes before and pick up a number and pins either from me or from the organisers box . 
^ + we have a great team so far , and we are seriously going to do well ! 
^ see you all tomorrow or sunday .
