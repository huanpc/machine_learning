^ dearest petal , it 's nearly christmas , and although &name and nicety pervades the land , it stops at our front door , so i feel free to insult you . 
^ &num yes , &name and &name are hyper-christians . 
^ ( i feel so unworthy ) . 
^ you are different because i do n't think you are easily shocked . 
^ at least , having a poker face , you do n't show it . 
^ &num my room is really not that messy at all . 
^ in a mess hierarchy of the flat , you are at the top , followed by &name , then me , then &name and &name . 
^ i do n't really like mess . 
^ it disturbs and distracts me . 
^ &num i am sorry about whispering . 
^ it was very rude , and i 'm sorry . 
^ &num i am not having a party . 
^ i just invited everyone to my house knowing that most people would n't be able to come . 
^ &name and &name &name and &name are coming though . 
^ you are missing out on my favourite foods- they are expensive , ha ha ha . 
^ &num i find &name 's message to you rather amusing . 
^ &num happy christmas , sweet &name , may your blessings be plentiful in the new year . 
^ love &name

^ from : &name ( &email ) to : &email subject : &name is doomed &name : &name , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &num 
^ hi &name , 
^ " &name 
^ - catchy . 
^ " you talked to &name in some weird and unintelligible version of english ( can the scots get nothing right ? ) 
^ - evidently not . 
^ think about it . 
^ obviously you cannot either , hence your sentence without meaning . 
^ " &name was rude it 's just a good job &name and &name were n't there . 
^ - why ? ? ? 
^ do you see &name and &name as some ultra-moral , easy-to-offend , hyper-christian people ? 
^ i was there , how different am i to &name and &name ? 
^ " what is this , i talked to &name in our own language ? 
^ - well , i assume you did . 
^ since &name and i talked for about &num minutes in whisper mode whilst there was nothing appearing on the main screen , we assumed you and &name were conversing in your own language . 
^ " i do not remember insulting you at any point . 
^ but enlighten me . 
^ - most assuredly i shall enlighten you . 
^ you called me names . 
^ i then asked if you enjoyed insulting me and you replied with something along the lines of " have you just worked that out ? 
^ do you remember ? 
^ 'maybe you could slip a little something into her early morning cup of tea to see exactly how hyper she can get funny ! 
^ - very funny ! 
^ it is worth it just to imagine it . 
^ i am laughing as i type . 
^ 'maybe i could place you in a room surrounded by mess , with an unseen but audible vacuum cleaner next door 
^ - if we assume this took place in &name &char then there could be some slight technical difficulties i would have to be placed in either yours or &name 's room as they are the only untidy &num . 
^ if i was placed in your room then it would n't work as vacuum cleaners are terrified of &name 's room . 
^ if i was placed in &name 's room then that would also be impossible because vacuum cleaners are terrified of you and they have no need ( i 'm not talking about desire here ) to go into my room . 
^ in either case , i 'm the only &num in the flat who understands how to switch on vacuum cleaners . 
^ " &name , are you coming to my house for my birthday ? 
^ i would love to see you , and you know my parents adore you . 
^ you could clean my room . 
^ &name boy i do n't offer everyone that privilege , you know . 
^ - much as i would love to i 'm afraid i am taking my grandmother ( yes , the &num with &num lives ) to see &name on the 26th . 
^ i 'm sorry &name , thanks very much for inviting me though . 
^ i 've sent you a birthday card , so do n't think it 's a christmas &num and open it on monday ! 
^ anyway , i did n't know you were going to have a party . 
^ would i have known anyone else who will be there ? 
^ it will break my heart not to have the chance to clean your room . 
^ oh ! 
^ why do i always miss these life-changing experiences ? ! ? 
^ anyway , is your room ever really messy ? 
^ i do n't think it is at &name , but then i 'm comparing yours with &name 's. 
^ " got to go , i 'm going out for a meal with some friends ( yes , i have more than &num ) . 
^ - who 's the one ? 
^ ( i 'm joking , i know you have lots and lots of friends just in case you get offended . ) 
^ i got &num christmas cards today ! 
^ actually , it was a bit embarrassing . 
^ well how would you explain a christmas card that was addressed to " &name " &name &name , on the envelope , to your parents when they give it to you ? 
^ that would have been relatively okay , but then i opened it and discovered it was from a guy &name 
^ - an interesting experience . 
^ it turned out my fears were unfounded as my parents did not conclude i had weird friends , just &num with an interesting sense of humour . 
^ guess what was on the front of &name 's card . 
^ a duvet ! 
^ he is just so obsessed with duvets , especially his own . 
^ well , i must go . 
^ actually , i must n't, but i do n't want to bore you further by continuing to type when i really am not thinking much about what i am typing . 
^ oh , i was for the rest of the e-mail , do n't worry , but not for this paragraph . 
^ i 'm pleased to hear you are looking forward to finishing your work at the &name office . 
^ have a wonderful christmas , 
^ &name 
^ &name i 'm sorry about the " hello ? 
^ e-mail . 
^ i was just wondering if you were still alive as you had n't e-mailed in a week . 
^ but then neither had &num , although that 's another story .
