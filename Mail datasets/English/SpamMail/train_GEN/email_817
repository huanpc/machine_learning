^ &name sir &name of &name . 
^ thanks for the postcard . 
^ i 'm glad to hear you are enjoying yourself on the &name isle . 
^ i have been working the last few days , as well as spending some time with my friend &name . 
^ i had a good time with &name - he is well and sends his greetings . 
^ we made a rather nice bowl out of walnut wood which i 'll bring up to the flat next term . 
^ &name is a bit better after i gave her a good clean-out and made sure all her components were in order . 
^ guess what , i 'm buying a lap-top ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ yes , &name is getting the ultimate companion , but it might mean that she does not come with me this time to &name - fairly shocking i think you 'll agree . 
^ anyway , more on &name ( the lap-top ) later . 
^ you 're taking pollen tablets are you - please do n't overdose &name , however bad everything feels . 
^ i am hoping we can all come and see you on that &char / end . 
^ i 'm also looking forward to it . 
^ &name , the other day i overdrew my bank account for the first time . 
^ now i have got an overdraft , just like all the other students ! 
^ oh well . 
^ are you back this &char / end ? 
^ we could chat online tomorrow ( sunday ) sometime ?
