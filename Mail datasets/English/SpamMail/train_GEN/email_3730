^ i get slightly different equations than you do . 
^ the only important difference appears to be the polynomial for before mass extinction where i have a smaller and not significant coefficient for quadratic term . 
^ slopes are different statistically before and after ( if restrict yourself to linear models ) . 
^ so you could say that the growth trend picks up somewhat after the mass extinction event which hit the brachs harder . 
^ what else do you need ? 
^ remember we are off to &name tomorrow .
