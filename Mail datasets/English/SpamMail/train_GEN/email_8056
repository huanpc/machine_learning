^ &name &name , diddily &name 
^ &name - &name to meet you . 
^ is that a &name ball in your pocket or are you just pleased to see me ? 
^ one of the most problematic things about a &num day break in a random conversation is that ( now ) i also do n't understand pretty much anything you , or especially i , have said . 
^ &name , i 'll have to turn up the randomness instead . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name &name , 
^ okay , first of all : welcome , &name , to the conversation . 
^ &name , i think you may have met &name before . 
^ &name , &name ; &name , &name etc. . 
^ now , &name , you may find the conversation &char * wee * bit hard to understand , having just joined and not having the benefit of having seen what came before . 
^ * believe * me . ... &char * was * there from the start , and &char * still * do n't have a clue what 's going on most of the time . 
^ anyway ... 
<text_embedded> 

^ &name &name 
</text_embedded>

^ okay , why ? 
^ i am neither &name nor a mouse . 
^ and if you say " prove it " i swear i 'll break your legs ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ well , it would be humorous to watch you try and catch me and then break my legs . 
^ bring on the pain . 
^ i like it . 
^ but then again , it would stop me delivering all the presents to all the poor little children so i just may have to avoid that . 
^ after much thinking ( that was yesterdays task ) i think i said &name " &name you called me &name . 
^ pretty logical really .

^ its my destiny to eat lard and stay slim and trim . 
^ &name &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ but why do you * want * to be fat ? 
^ is n't slim and trim good ? 
</text_embedded>

^ i need to have more gravitational attraction . 
</text_embedded>

^ for ... ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ attracting things . 
^ &name . 
^ spoons and ice-cream would be nice . 
^ attracting the lab to my house would be useful . 
^ unlimited possibilities really . 
</text_normal>

<text_embedded> 

^ respect . 
</text_embedded>

^ maximum respect . 
</text_embedded>

^ for me ? 
^ or are you now demanding maximum respect for your small yet perfectly formed ass ? 
^ in which case , what * is * the maximum respect for an ass ? 
^ is it like a maximal matching in a bipartite graph ? 
^ so can i prove that i 'm giving maximum rspect by failing to find augmenting paths in your ass ? 
^ it 's all so confusing . ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ true , but i think you 're on the right lines here . 
^ please expand it and bit , prove your hypothesis and you will have a new theory of respectability and the &name do n't forgot to give respect . 
</text_normal>

^ i know , lets do a &name analysis ( &name , &name , &name ) on the fab-ness of &name . 
^ i 'll start : &name : 
^ - name is &name 
^ - maybe french 
^ well , thats me done . 
</text_embedded>

^ well done . 
^ i 'm not sure what the point of this exercise is , but ... 
^ &name : 
^ - appreciable language ( linguistics ) knowledge source 
^ - &name to make sure people * understand * their practicals but ... 
^ - has funny little goatee you can stare at instead of listening too hard 
^ ( you missed that out of the features ... tsk tsk ... ) 
^ your turn . 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ &name : 
^ - will further the cause of language ( linguistics ) knowledge which * must * be a good thing 
^ - makes everyone a little bit more happy because he does have what is actually quite an amusing name 
^ - must make some woman very happy with that goatee of his 
^ so now , &name has quite a comprehensive fab . 
</text_embedded>

^ can i forward this to him ? 
^ oh , i think he 's coming to the &name meal tonight , actually , so i can just print it out and give it to him on person .. i 'm sure he 'll be * so * impressed . 
^ either that or ridiculously scared that i 've been speaking about him to people he 'd never met in emails . 
^ &name anyone ... ? 
^ anyway , that reminds me : i saw his ( i;m assuming it was his ) name on one of the emails for this meal . 
^ his ( full ? ) name is ... ( trumpet fanfare) ... &name &name . 
^ not fabian , unfortunately . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name - &char ) disappointing , &char ) is n't that a brand of razor ? 
^ &name - well , that just makes me hungry .
