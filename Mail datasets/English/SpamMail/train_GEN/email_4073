^ &name , 
^ i want to write to you about some stuff ... 
^ throughout my time at &name , you have been a great " blessing " to me - your friendship , honesty and companionship have meant a great deal . 
^ when i look back at &name and think about how fantastic it was , you will be one of the reasons why i think that . 
^ this year we have seen a lot less of each other . 
^ there are some obvious reasons for that , ie. for the first time we do n't live in the same immediate vicinity , so we do n't " pass each other " like we used to , and we ca n't just " pop in " on our way somewhere . 
^ i 've missed that , but it is of course inevitable . 
^ i 'm also aware that i 've spent a lot more time working this year , and that has meant a certain amount of 'recluse-ness " ! 
^ i guess that 's a price i pay for the standards i set myself . 
^ perhaps the main reason , though , is because of &name . 
^ you have " given " a lot more ( time , attention , etc. ) to her and her friends than you have to us , your " old " friends ( apart from &name , for obvious reasons ) , and you are not wrong to have done that - it is genuinely your choice who you give yourself to . 
^ i have been hurt at times by how you 've acted , and i 'll explain why : from pretty much the start of the first year , you were very open and honest with me about how you were feeling and what you were thinking about , etc. , and i was very privileged to be in that position . 
^ i did not deserve your trust and companionship , but you gave it to me . 
^ i have felt that right through the first &num years and into the third , but since you have got together with &name , you have not really talked to me at all about anything going on in your life . 
^ that is ok - like i say , you do n't owe it to me to share yourself with me , but it has meant a lot to me , and now i have lost it . 
^ that is why it hurts . 
^ the reason i do n't come and see you more often is that you are with &name almost every time i have been round , and i ca n't relate to you and her in the same way that i relate to you . 
^ i do n't know her , and unfortunately i have n't / do n't have time to get to know her . 
^ i 'm not saying this is " right " but it 's how i feel . 
^ the reason i 'm saying all this is because i want you to know that i do n't value your friendship any less now than i have ever done . 
^ the reason i do n't see you is not because i do n't want to . 
^ i am not trying to give you a guilt trip about the choices you 've made this year - i do n't think your decisions have been wrong . 
^ but i do n't think i can have the friendship with you at the moment that i 've had with you over the last few years . 
^ i just want you to know how i really feel - i do n't want you to 'make more of an effort " to see me . 
^ just do n't feel that i do n't care any more or something . 
^ anyway , pretty heavy stuff , but i felt i could write it better ( and definitely more quickly ! ) than saying it .
