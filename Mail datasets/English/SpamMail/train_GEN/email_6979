^ is there anyway that i can run sfxmaker via the command line so it does not show anything to the screen . 
^ i am in the process of writing a perl script that will sit on my webserver that zips and compiles to an exe all the stuff i want to backup , then sends it to an email account . 
^ my only stubbling block right now is that sfxmaker trys to print to the screen when it is compiling the exe thus making the script hang . 
^ i would greatly appreciate your help .
