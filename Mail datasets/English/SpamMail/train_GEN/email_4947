^ hi &name , 
^ i met with &name earlier today to discuss the stream id matter that we were talking about . 
^ i think that we agreed that we could probably implement the system without stream ids , but the complexity that moving restream into the aggregate boxes ( and hence having these aggregate boxes perform &num different othogonal grouping operations ) would be large and users might have trouble thinking about queries in terms of these complex operators . 
^ it seems difficult to compare the benefits from removing stream ids with the negatives of increasing the complexity of these aggregate boxes but it seems that the negatives outweigh the positives . 
^ what do you think ?
