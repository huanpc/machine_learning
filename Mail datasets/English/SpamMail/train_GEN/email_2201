" ^ - do you ever forget ? ! ^ regarding an accurate description of your pink t-shirt " yes , it does ! ^ did  ame tell you ? " ^ - he did indeed . ^ actually , i saw one at camp and thought it must be the one you mentioned . ^ it 's nice . ^  ame , you saw  ame . ^ very nice , is she well ? ^ " i did lots of fun things with  ame and had a very lovely time . " ^ - i 'm glad to hear you enjoyed yourself . ^ " our church went up to  ame today ( do you know where that is ? ^ - near  ame ) as we have the use of a house there for the next  um weeks . ^ i may be going and staying up there next week . " ^ - no , i ca n't say i recognise the name , although i do know seahouses . ^ i recall you went there last summer - possibly ? ^ " well , i hope you had a nice day in  ame ( - what were you doing there ? ) and you have a good week at work . ^ glad the job is ok . " ^ - i had a lovely day in  ame . ^ i was visiting my grandmother in  ame . ^ she was reasonably well and pleased to see us all . ^ i also went for some nice long walks and generally had a restful time . ^ thank you , i hope my week goes well too . ^ as of yet i am still awaiting lorries with grain from the harvest . ^ i need grain to test ! ! ! ^ it 's so boring at the moment , and i had to paint windows again today . ^ there are some things i just do n't want to be an expert at . ^ " i started doing some economics reading last week too . ^ did n't get very far , but it 's a start . ^ i intend to do lots this week " ^ -  ame for you . ^ i have now virtually finished my dissertation , and so am now free to spend my evenings reading up for next year . ^ i have so much stuff to get through ! ^ i 've decided i 'm going to work hard next year . ^ getting half a percent more than the requirement to stay on my course was rather a nerve-racking experience . ^ now ^ i would be happy to come down to  ame some saturday ( they are the best days for me due to work ) and i will be free on the 18th or 25th of august . ^ either would be equally suitable . ^ well , a  ame  ame exhibition ? ^ whilst i do like voyager very much , i 'm not so sure about being a trekkie . ^ it 's a big decision and i do n't know if i feel ready to make the commitment . ^ being a devotee of  ame is  um thing , but i feel i must ask myself how far do i really want to pursue this line ? ^ no , i 'd be happy to see the exhibition , but if you spot anything else which is on then that could be interesting too . ^ your ideas for the rest of the day sound very nice too . ^ this evening i ordered a  ame rewriter for  ame , my computer . ^ i am very much looking forward to its arrival on wednesday , as i shall be able to make  ame 's! ^ i will also be able to create back-up files of all my , important to me , files . ^ i 've also bought  ame of  ame , so  ame will be whizzing along with  ame shortly . ^ the reason for my little spending spree is that my brother was told of a shop in  ame which sells computer products very cheaply . ^ my  ame only costs me  um pounds . ^ well , it has been a lovely sunny day here at  ame castle . ^ since i 've been getting up relatively early lately i managed to see a deer  um morning last week in the field outside my bedroom window ! ^ i was very pleased . ^ i have been helping my dad in our garden too and am enjoying doing that . ^ our neighbours are away at the moment so it is very quiet here . ^ i 'd better go now , as my mum wants to use the computer . ^ i hope you manage to get lots of economics done and enjoy it too . ^ i am studying exciting chemistry ! ^ have a lovely week , be it in  ame ,  ame or wherever ! ^ very best wishes , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
