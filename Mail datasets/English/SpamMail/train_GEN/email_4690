^ what sort of things are you hoping to do in &name &name ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ one of the biggest reasons for going to &name &name is to be able to spend some time far away from the intellectual environment of university . 
^ there 's more to life than the intellect , but sometimes it does n't always seem that way when you 're focusing on it all the time ! 
^ i want to spend time thinking and praying and being immersed in a non-intellectual , more spiritually-aware environment . 
^ another reason for going is that i 've got friends out there who i spent a while with out there in one of my gap years and i would love to see them again and see the country again , etc. . 
^ congrats for your results ! 
^ &num is outrageous ! 
^ looking forward to seeing you at &name 's thing . 
^ let me know details and dates when you have them . 
^ keep it real &name !

^ hey , well done mate ! 
^ i never doubted that you would do well but i am glad to hear that you have ! 
^ you must be really pleased ! 
^ so you 're thinking of doing a phd ! 
^ that 's cool as well . 
^ i guess you have found something that you really get a lot out of . ... i 'm sure you 'll have no probs getting in with always ask people why they are going to a certain place because when someone you know says they are going travelling , it is very easy to be flipant about where they say they are going , but the truth is that most people have a desire to go somewhere for a reason ! 
^ i would like to go to &name i think , because the language barrier is removed but it is an amazing place with so many diverse areas to it . 
^ i got some results myself the other day . 
^ seemed to do pretty well in everything ( high 60's and low 70's) . 
^ i got &num for my solo performance which was cool and &num for music theory which i thought was particularly good because it was hard work ! 
^ to be honest , because this diploma does n't really lead me anywhere i am not too bothered about results but i am unfortunately a very competitive person who likes to do my best at everything so i am secretly really happy ! 
^ the band thing is going well and we have recruited a permanant drummer and bass player now ! 
^ it 's really good fun . 
^ anyway mate , well done again ! 
^ it 's good to hear you 're doing so well !
