^ hello ... i know it 's another e-mail from us but i 'll try to keep it brief ... 
^ firstly , did you know that there 's a group of christians who meet to pray for &name every week ? 
^ if you 've been to &name then it 's a great chance to reminisce with people about the " &name experience " , and to pray with people who share a passion for that continent . 
^ anyone who 's been to &name or just has a heart to pray for &name is really welcome to come . 
^ tomorrow we 're gonna be mainly praying for &name , as their vital presidential elections take place next weekend and they really need some prayer ! 
^ we meet on mondays at 1pm in the main library , in study room &num , which is off the computer room on the second-from-top floor . 
^ i 'll be at the entrance to the library at &num tomorrow if anyone wants to come ... 
^ secondly , you probably know that college communion is trying to be more student-friendly . 
^ the cu has been asked to lead the prayers at communion this coming tuesday . 
^ so we 're looking for &num or &num willing volunteers to do just that - you can be people who normally go or people who 've never been before ( like me ! ) . 
^ if you 're interested please let me or &name know .
