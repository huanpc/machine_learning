^ correction : my room 's &name &num , not &num &smiley and if you do know your way around &name ( it 's not really a maze ! ) , it 's 3rd floor ( &name ) , go straight ahead when you get to the top of the stairs , and it 's on the end of the corridor- there are only &num rooms on that corridor and mine has my name on it , so it should n't be too hard to find ... &smiley love &name
