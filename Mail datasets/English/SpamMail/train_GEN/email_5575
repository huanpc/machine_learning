^ &name : a lightweight approach to &name retrieval and conversational natural language 
^ speaker : &name &name - &name &name 
^ &name : many approaches to natural language processing require large dictionaries , large grammars or both . 
^ for reasons of development cost , runtime performance and complexity , it can be desirable to avoid this , relying instead on simpler , robust techniques that nevertheless are still fit-for-purpose for many real-world applications . 
^ in this talk , the following software systems will be described and demonstrated : 
^ &name : a real-time text retrieval system that implements a combination of tagged searches , &name keyword searching and statistical approaches . 
^ &name : a conversational natural language processing ( chatterbot ) system that uses &name as a back-end database . 
^ &name : a special purpose programming language with a syntax loosely based upon &name and that is intended for the preprocessing of natural language queries in conversational question answering systems . 
^ &name has been in commercial use for some time by a number of companies within the &name and worldwide . 
^ &name was seen on &name &name 's world in early &num and has been in continuous use within the &name &name " exhibit at the &name point exhibition in &name , &name since its opening .
