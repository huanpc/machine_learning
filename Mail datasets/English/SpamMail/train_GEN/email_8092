^ &name have been so shite lately on the email front , 
^ am ok , have been quite busy what with lots of birthdays , and people visiting from foreign countries etc. i have had &num exam result back , which was the last one from that saturday , which i passed , with &name , a &char grade , but 50th in year from &num , so no so bad . 
^ also have a new supervisior , as our old one has been sacked ... most distressing for him . 
^ and my interview with the &name is on 24th april , when i find out my other results . 
^ i have aletter from the dean saying i am a model student though , just to make people accept us for electives . 
^ i am at &name at the &name , doing psych , and is vvvvv good fun . 
^ spent all this morning talking to some guy who witnessed some government conspiracy last night , and he is on a &num man mission to deal with it ... most amusing . 
^ another woman thinks she is in &name and &name , not a mental hospital ... and yet another thinks they have been smited by god , have marks all over their back , and that the germans are still invading ... he also tried to kill his neighbour , as he was trying to poison him ... clearly .
