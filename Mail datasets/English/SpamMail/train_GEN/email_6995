^ dear &name , 
^ here 's some stuff i picked up in the programme : 
^ p2 / &num make sure you remember to put where the toilets are ! ! ! 
^ ( just making sure .. ) p3- &num is missing , it should &name " &num . 
^ &name : &name , weg mit dem " p5- does &name &name &name want capitals or not ? 
^ p6- in &name &name 's entry , works are given as eg " &name messiah' - this is inconsistent with the rest of the programme which has " &name 's &name " ( ie with an apostrophe ) &name &name &name &name ( missing &char not tution ! ) p9- &name 's talk- " &name &name says this : " ( colon instead of a full stop ? 
^ and / or quotation marks for the verse ? ) p13- &name 'soll ich den kelch nicht trinken " ( missing 'den " ) p16- &num title- " &name &name ihn " ( not 'standte ihn " ) 
^ did n't find anything else . 
^ thanks for all the work ! 
^ &name 
^ 'most assuredly , i say to you , he who hears my word and believes in him who sent &name has everlasting life , and shall not come into judgement , but has passed from death into life . " &name 5v24- the &name
