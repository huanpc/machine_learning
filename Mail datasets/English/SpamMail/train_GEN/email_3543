" his voice was deep , but had a musical quality to it . ^ the gentle wind caught the man 's rough and now heavily stained shirt , old and repaired many times . ^ it flapped loose , and he tucked it back in the thick leather belt he wore around his waist . ^ " and there is a stream nearby . ^ that will be useful . " ' essential . " ^ as they were in no hurry , the men stood there in the light for a while longer , allowing their eyes to take in the shimmering beauty of the place . ^ the sun retreated behind a grey cloud , and the light dimmed accordingly , shadows merging until all was dark , like dusk . ^ now the place they stood felt much cooler and almost sinister , as if the light itself had betrayed them . ^ the men walked off to the east , towards the camp they had made near the rocky shore . ^ as they turned their backs , the sun broke through the cloud , and the distant , stuttered tapping of the woodpecker returned to the forest . ^ as the fathers ,  ame and  ame by name , neared the beach they heard their children playing , their shrill voices and screams carried like the diving gulls on the sea breeze . ^ the  um families had come here , to this mysterious new land , this "  ame  ame " that was only just starting to be explored . ^ they had left their homes in county  ame , in the north-eastern part of  ame almost  um months ago now , sent on their way by their bishop with his false and unconvincing blessing and smile , representative of their whole old community . ^ but that life was behind them now , and while they missed the rolling hills and their solid stone houses terribly , this was a new start . ^ did they deserve this ? ^ neither man had done anything wrong in  ame , except fall out with the  ame . ^  ame  ame stood a few miles or so east of the outer fringes of the cathedral city of  ame , on a substantial bluff of the county 's yellow sandstone . ^ like the majestic cathedral and its undamaged castle , the  ame could be seen for miles , and like the bishop , the great family 's power extended much further than simply what they could see from their ivy-covered towers . ^ the  ame were not wicked people ; no , they just needed to have their way , and usually they got it . ^ however , when the  ame and the  ame were approached with the news that the  ame  ame desired their farms , the noble  ame family was , for once , refused , and quite properly so , many said . ^ it was not that the residents of the  ame needed the land , but that the old farm buildings spoiled the view from the guest quarters and breakfast room . ^ however as the summer waned and autumn broke forth with grey cloud , heralding the approach of winter , the stubbornness of these  um proud farming families isolated them from the rest of the community . ^ the storekeeper would not serve them anymore for the  ame 's business was too important to him , and he , unlike the  ame and  ame , knew better than to cross them . ^ over the long winter things did not improve , and every disaster which came their way had the seal of  ame hall stamped in solid , yet untouchable red upon it . ^ by spring , even the church refused them and that was the breaking of farmers and their families . ^ mr.  ame and mr.  ame had climbed up the rounded hill to  ame  ame and were immediately ushered into the rich and decorous presence of  ame  ame . ^ the lord was not in the habit of making people wait , at least not people who were giving him what he wanted . ^ after little bartering , the  um farmers obtained the prices they wanted for their land and houses . ^  ame did n't mind , as the money was but a trifle to him . ^ besides , his daughters would be pleased . ^ so the  um families had made their way to  ame and boarded one of the first ships for the  ame  ame . ^ they took little with them , except a few tools , their  um best carthorses and , as mrs.  ame would not have had it any other way , the  ame " dull , but highly prized pewter plates . ^ they also took a battered bible , which only mr.  ame could read , and he , only in places , but it seemed the proper thing to do . ^ the  um families ,  um people in all , had begun their new life . ^ having had their old lives inexorably mixed by misfortune , these  um would discover their new lives and destinies together . ^ what do you think ? ^ well , tell me when you get out of hospital . ^ i 'm going to get people like graeme and  ame , etc in the cu to pray for you . ^ i 'll pray that you are out by christmas . ^ i do n't know if we should put times on prayers , but i think spending christmas in hospital might not be the most fun , still i could be wrong . ^  ame , get better soon . ^ i shall try to write a better e-mail tomorrow . ^ love and prayers from your friend , corridor mate , ex-flat mate , and after eight-eater ,  ame </text_normal></message_body></message>
