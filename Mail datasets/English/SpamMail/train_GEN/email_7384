^ hi &name , 
^ do n't worry about missing the pub crawl . 
^ sorry i did n't let you know earlier - but i sent an e-mail as soon as i got back ! 
^ i think there is another college bar crawl being organised next saturday or something . 
^ we should know by friday . 
^ &name , we do seem to have a lack of freshers this year - lots signed up , but not many seem to be coming to ringing !

^ yeah , sorry i did n't make this - i had to decide by half &num what i was doing that evening & since i did n't have this info i decided instead to go to the &name &name meeting . 
^ not your fault ( the timing of the e-mail that is ) but just the way things worked out . 
^ i did however find another fresher who is interested in taking up ringing ! 
^ see you on friday , 
^ cheers ,
