^ &name , 
^ my favourite canadian / american / &name . 
^ i actually came to the computer room today with the express purpose of writing to you . 
^ i am missing you ! 
^ the flat has just not been the same without your good self . 
^ i have missed having you visiting me first thing in the morning and last thing at night ! 
^ i have missed our discussions . 
^ today is the last day before the end of term . 
^ it has gone very quickly , as always . 
^ tonight &name and &name &name are coming over for a meal and then i am playing in the leavers formal . 
^ ok , let me tell you about myself and &name . 
^ you remember that i said i was going to talk to you , but then there was n't time so i said i 'd email you . 
^ i was just waiting for a good time , and here it is ! ... 
^ first of all , can you remember me telling you at the start that we did n't really know what to do in our relationship , because we did n't feel it was right to just follow society , and at the same time we did n't know what commitment to make , etc. etc. 
^ well , we never actually made a real decision about what our commitment was to each other - i never " asked her out " or anything . 
^ however we obviously had a strong mutual atraction and we were n't sure what to do with it . 
^ in the end , people assumed we were " going out " and after a while we just told people that anyway because that was what they understood . 
^ in fact , we started to take on that " couple " sort of image because of different people 's expectations as well as our own . 
^ now , we 'd both been feeling uncomfortable for a while , but we did n't know why . 
^ at this point i 'm going to have to give you a bit of an abbreviated version of my inner ramblings , because otherwise it would take too long . 
^ can you remember when we were walking to college , and we were talking about what to do in your relationship before you are ready to make the marriage commitment ? 
^ we were saying that it is best to stay away from an exclusive marriage-type relationship so that you can hear &name properly before you actually decide to get married . 
^ well , after a number of different conversations ( with my mum , brother , friend from home , you , etc. etc. ) i realised why i was feeling uncomfortable about my relationship with &name . 
^ i realised that for us it was wrong to have an exclusive couple-type relationship when neither of us was ready to get married . 
^ this is a very much shortened version of what led me to this decision , but for the rest you 'll have to speak to me because it would take too long to write . 
^ so , i spoke to &name and she knew that it was the right thing as well , and we decided that we should not have a commitment to each other before we were ready to at least plan for marriage . 
^ i spoke to her just around the time you left . 
^ it is not an easy thing for us , and we are still working a lot of things out , but i feel it is for the best , even though it is all quite confusing to me in a lot of ways . 
^ this might throw up quite a few questions for you , i realise . 
^ feel free to email me and ask me anything you want to . 
^ stay well &name ,

^ &name &name ! 
^ life here is going well , and i 'm settled into &num great churches here . 
^ &name is good . 
^ i must admit there is another reason for me e-mailing you . 
^ it kinda reminds me of a question i asked you at the end of the first term . 
^ " are you and &name going out ? " 
^ sorry for the bluntness of the question , but i 'd quite like to know . 
^ praying for you &name . 
^ &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ get your free&email address at &website or your free&email address at &website
