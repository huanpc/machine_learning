^ thanks for your assistance . 
^ i fired up the product and tried to insert some text . 
^ i could not put the product in text insert mode . 
^ must i enter text in some other program and then import it into &name ? 
^ or does it have its own built-in text editor ?

^ &name , glad you made it over from the &name list to get more info about &name . 
^ i think as you play with it , you will find it quite useful and capable . 
^ &name is much like &name &name , the &name program formally used on earlier &name &name and windows . 
^ much like some of the &name programs that were available on the &name as well . 
^ as i have not seen quark in a very long time , so i cannot say how it operates now . 
^ &name requires you to first create a " box " to put things in , a text box for text and a graphics box for pictures / graphics . 
^ once you create your text box on the page , it can be any size you want as you can always resize it later , then one only needs to click on the text tool ( the cursor icon ) and click in the box to begin typing . 
^ of course , text can also be imported into the box as well , if you have pretyped data you want to use . 
^ &name , &name and quark , possibly , now allow you to just create a page and start typing , after grabbing the text tool . 
^ some folks like this method , while others like the " box " method &name uses . 
^ i have used both and really find both useful in different situations , but the " box " method seems to give the user more flexibility , plus maintaining the sanity of your text or graphic . 
^ hope you enjoy learning and using &name .
