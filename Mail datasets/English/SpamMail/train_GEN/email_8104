^ &name &name &name , 
^ just a quick note to wish you happy 21st tomorrow or maybe now if you 're reading it on the 4th . 
^ also to let you know i 've got a new e-mail address at work . 
^ not sure exactly what it is or how it differs from the last one but i 'm sure if you compare the &num addresses at the top of this letter and the last one you 'll see the difference . 
^ not a lot been hapening &name still managing to go out all weekend but too tired and not enough time to do any housework or cooking . 
^ &name forgot she grilled burgers and micro 'd a tin of beans last night , think that 's about &num or &num times she 's cooked since i got back from &name , she 's also done the dishes once and possibly partly cleaned the upstairs toilet . 
^ there 's going to be some changes soon although she 's threatening to move out when &name arrive . 
^ if she does she 'll have to sign a contract to get back in again . 
^ have n't heard much from the &name this last while back so ca n't say much about what they 're planning apart from your sister arriving &name same day you get home . 
^ have n't heard much from &name lately , she 's keeping a low profile . 
^ gran and &name are fine although they had to call the nurse out for dide at 3am . 
^ not sure what was wrong but he looked fine when i was down at &num although he was still in bed . 
^ &name ey and &name are starting to get a bit busier so they will be pleased with that . 
^ how 's the boy racer doing with his new wheeels , has he got something organised for coming up to the &name yet ? 
^ well have to go as i 've got a ton of work to do in the next &num nights so i 'm going to have to concentrate on &name 's work and forget about any homers .
