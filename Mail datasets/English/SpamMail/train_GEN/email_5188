^ oh , good you noticed . 
^ i experimented with this invisible counter some time ago ( to see how many people access my subcat evaluation page ) , but now the counter website appears to be down , and it gives this error message instead . 
^ i have just removed the &name script , so hopefully it will work soon . 
^ if not , then let me know and i can email the paper to you .
