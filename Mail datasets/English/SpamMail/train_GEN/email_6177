^ hi &name , 
^ i remember you mentioned that you would be interested in participating in the &name study that i am running . 
^ i am presently looking for volunteers at 
^ the following times and am wondering whether you could manage any of these : 
^ tuesday 4th &name : &num : 15am for &num : 30am 
^ 11: 45am for &num noon 
^ or 
^ tuesday 11th &name : &num : 45am for &num : 00am &num : 15am for &num : 30am &num : 45am for &num noon &num : 15pm for &num : 30pm 
^ i 'd be very grateful if you could let me know either way . 
^ i ca n't remember but i think i did go through the screening questionnaire with you . 
^ did i ? 
^ also , ca n't remember whether i told you that you would receive &pound; &num per hour for scanning , that i 'd ask you to fill in some questionnaires in your own time ( &pound; &num ) and that i 'd ask you to come back to 
^ the unit about &num weeks later to answer some questions about the pictures . 
^ also , if you are interested , i will have to get a contact telephone number 
^ for you , and then will send you a map describing how to get the &name &name &name &name up at &name 's. 
^ i look forward to hearing from you . 
^ best wishes , 
^ &name
