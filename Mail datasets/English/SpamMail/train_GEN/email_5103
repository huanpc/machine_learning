^ hi everyone ! 
^ i only got a few replies to my last email . 
^ i then have to consider that all who did n't reply do n't have any problem with either date . 
^ given the lack of volunteers , i 've had to choose who would give a talk and when . 
^ i 've tried to be fair and to have a good balance of talks / levels for either date . 
^ here is my proposition . 
^ if you do n't like it , let me know . 
^ so , for friday &num june , we 'll have ( order &name ) : 
^ &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name 
^ in july ( date and order &name ) : 
^ &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name 
^ a last point : &name &name will be visiting in july around the time we 're having the second meeting . 
^ what do people think about inviting him ? 
^ &name
