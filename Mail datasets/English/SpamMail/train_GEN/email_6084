^ hope you 're all doing ok , here 's my first email to you of the term ! 
^ [ please do let me know if you did n't get the letter i sent you all last week so i can send you another - it contains important info !

^ &num &name ... please advertise this to your college groups this week ... 
^ &name &name from &name is coming to speak . 
^ he 's going to be talking about gospel work in east &name , and more specifically about the christian &name movement there . 
^ this summer he was in &name with a team supporting the students there in evangelism . 
^ did you know that in &name less than &num are christians in the student world ? 
^ &name equivalent of &num or &num undergraduate christians in the whole of &name university ! 
^ this should be a real challenge for us to be praying for this part of the world , and bringing the gospel to people from this part of the world who have come to study in &name . 
^ so do encourage lots to come along , it should be really interesting stuff . 
^ &num &name fliers ... hot off the press , coming to your pigeon hole in time for college group meetings on wednesday evening ( check your pigeon hole just before your meeting ... they should get there in time ) . 
^ put some aside to take to ( or pigeon hole ) to invite international undergraduates you know of , and then please please encourage your college group to take them and use them to invite internationals who they know .

^ &num message from &name ... 
^ dear &name this is not the regular &name 's email nattering for a place at your formal hall this term ( that will be coming soon ! ! ) i 'm currently updating a very old document advising &name 's reps which &name 's are possible and which are not ( current infon is from &num and complains that &pound; &num is too expensive ! ! ) . 
^ i would be very grateful if i could have the details of the fh 's of each college , particularly if you have them on a friday , what time they start , the guest ( not undergrad ! ! ) cost , and a contact name ( i realise this will probably change after &name , if you know who is likely to be the next rep / intrep , or someone who will be around for a while who may be willing to help us in the future , then give me their name as well ) this is relevant mostly for colleges which do have friday formals ! 
^ thanks so much &name &name &name
