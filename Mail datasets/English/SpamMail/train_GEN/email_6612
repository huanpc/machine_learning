^ dear &name , &name , &name , &name , &name and other people who may or may not be coming ( apologies for inbox clutter if you 're not ) 
^ &name , here 's the plan for monday : 
^ the prom starts at &num but we need to queue to get tickets , as you ca n't book them in advance . 
^ i 've been recommended to get there between &num and &num hours early , so i reckon we should aim to arrive soon after &num if possible . 
^ i had suggested going to &name or something for tea but &name tells me that there is n't one near the &name ( she had that idea when she went to a prom , and the food side of it all went wrong ... ) so i suggest we bring a packed tea and eat it in the queue . 
^ should be ok if it 's not raining ... hmm . 
^ of course , if you do n't fancy sandwiches that have been in your bag all day and do n't mind paying &name prices , i 'm sure we can buy you a sandwhich from somewhere during the day ... 
^ those coming just for the prom ( &name and &name as far as i know ) : you have to buy your ticket in person , so we ca n't get one for you , but the tickets do n't go on sale until &name . 
^ therefore i suggest you join us in the queue as soon as is practical - we wo n't have moved anywhere before &num anyway ... i really hope it 's not raining ... we 'll be queueing outside door &num i think - that 's for arena rather than gallery tickets . 
^ i reckon it 'll be more fun in the arena , though you might get a better view from the gallery . 
^ any thoughts ? 
^ as for what to do during the day ... here 's my plan but if you have a better one let me know ! 
^ &name modern sounds good , so we could meet there at about &num if that 's ok ? 
^ ( it 's across the river from &name tube station . ) i do n't really know if that means getting up at an unreasonable time in the morning for anyone ; if so then we can rearrange ! 
^ after that we could get cooked lunch somewhere seeing as we 'll be having packed tea - maybe a pizza ? 
^ once again i do n't know my way &name &name at all , so it will probably be a case of seeing what we pass at lunch time ish . 
^ the &name hall itself is fairly near the science museum , the natural history museum and the &name so we could easily visit one of those in the afternoon ; we can decide which on the day . 
^ &name people , shall we co-ordinate transport ? 
^ i think it 's back to the coach vs train dilemma ( train is faster and better for underground ; coach is cheaper ... ) how are &name and &name planning on getting there in the evening ? 
^ &name , i 'll phone you / talk on sunday ... 
^ &name , that 's all i can think of at the &name . ... my phone no is &num &num in case you get lost ( or in case i get lost ) . 
^ see you on monday ! 
^ i 'm very excited ! ! 
^ love &name xx
