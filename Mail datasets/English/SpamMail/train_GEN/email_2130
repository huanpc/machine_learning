" ^ - i 'm sorry  ame . ^ this confuses me . ^ sometimes i say things to you in e-mails that i think you might take offence at . ^ i am therefore am slightly worried at their reception , but they are quite often accepted as perfectly appropriate by you . ^ well , i guess sometimes things get a bit close to the bone . ^ i did n't know you were only being sarcastic ( well , i could n't tell ) , and i was n't in a good mood at the time ( as you might have guessed by my curt replies ) . ^ i should n't have taken offence , but i hate being accused of being gulible , coz , as you say , i am usually anything but . ^ however , it 's difficult to tell with email exactly how you express things - as the  ame library guide warned ( remember that one ? ? ! ! ) ^ - do you really not like me teasing you ? ^ i think i do it quite often . ^ do you mind ? ^ should i try not to ? ^ - i do n't mind teasing , so long as it does n't go too far . ^ i know that sounds as if i 'm being difficult , and it 's hard to know how far to go , but that 's just the truth . ^ i am a typical person - full of twisted self pride and a bundle of contradictions . ^ it 's easy to tell if you 've gone too far when you talk face to face , as an instant response can be made to let you know . ^ but , in email , it 's not so easy , as you get these statements and do n't know if it 's what the other person really believes , if it 's a joke , a wind up , or what . ... ! ! ! ^ whatever ! ^ " how come a till is an inanimate object , but "  ame is treated as an individual ? ^ bit of discrimination there i think . ^ * ^ - my answer is that i have never met a till with personality , whereas  ame most certainly has personality ^ - i 'm sorry , but i have to protest . ^  ame only has the personality that  ame choses to tell you she has . ^ he 's telling stories . ^  ame ! ! ^ i 'm going to incur the wrath of  ame in saying that . ^ however , i 'm not scared , coz he 's not  ame . ^ . . . . . . ... i sha n't regret my little excursion into  ame  ame world with  ame 's pictures after reading something like that ( ! ) ^ - what are you hatching up ? ? ? ^ i want to know ! ! ! ! ^ well  ame , it would have been nice if you had been online last night . . . . . . . . ... an uninvited guest turned up , calling himself "  ame " . . . . . . . . ... then we all told him to go away ^ - i know when i 'm not wanted ! ^ ( joke ) it would be awful if it turned out to be someone we 'd invited to chat ! ^ - well , if that was the case , they were asking for it by not revealing their true identity . ^ so , are you okay ? ^ - yes . ^ thankfully i have n't caught the cold that my sister  ame has at present : most unpleasant . ^ what have you been doing for the past few days ? ^ lots of shopping . ^  ame ! ^ i 've bought all the presents i need to buy . ^ how satisfying ! ^ also , stuffing envelopes through letter boxes . ^ i 've been doing something i never thought possible . ^ i now actually enjoy organic chemistry . . . . . . . ... i did absolutely none of it all last year ^ - was that the one which you 'stategically " passed by answering only  um ( or something like that ) of the paper ? ? ^ did you get your cards made for the 3rd world shop ? ^ - no , coz i had no card left . ^ i got some more today so am going to make some tonight while watching the next episode of " wives and  ame " . ^ i was watching the first part last night and it suddenly zapped off and the whole house plunged into darkness . ^ we had a power cut . ^ it was really rather exciting . ^ i was sitting on the floor stuffing gospels into envelopes ( we needed more done ! ) while  ame was lounging on the settee . ^ we were just getting stuck in with  ame and her little life when everything went off . ^ mad . ^ we could n't see a thing . ^ thankfully , we have a torch in the sitting room ( near the back door for when dad goes and checks his " weather station " : he has a thermometer and a rain gauge outside which he checks several times a day - it 's a hobby ( i call it an obsession ) which he has had for the past  um years ! ) so we managed to find that and seek out the matches and candles galore to light the house . ^ in the meantime , mam was in a mood upstairs as she 'd been in the middle of doing some work when the lights went out . ^ well , just imagine if you were struggling to diagnose what 's wrong with someone 's health , and just as you 're getting there , everything goes pitch black . ^  ame so , i delivered some candles to her , had the torch pinched from me by dad ^ - who set about trying to electricute himself by investigating the fuse box . ^ he then rang  ame electric , who said they were " investigating " too . ^ meanwhile ,  ame was getting annoyed as she wanted to watch the video , but could n't. ^ then she wanted some hot chocolate , but the kettle would n't boil . ^ we could n't even boil some water on the hob , as that is electric too . ^ i carried on stuffing envelopes - by candle light - and when i was done , thought i 'd go and email . ^  ame - no chance . ^ just makes you realise how much our everyday activites depend upon electricity . ^ anyway , we decided to put the christmas (  ame , the big  har ) tree up , so did that and decorated it , and then the lights suddenly came back on again . ^ so , after 1.5hrs of exciting candlelight , we returned to the modern form of illumination , and put the video back on ! ! ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ i mentioned about stuffing envelopes . ^ well , we have now delivered a lot of gospels round the area . ^ on monday morning ,  ame and i did  um blocks of flats , while dad and a bloke called  ame did a whole load of streets . ^ last night dad ,  ame and  ame (  um other people from church ) did a whole load too , while i stuffed some more envelopes as i realised we were going to run out . ^ it 's not been too bad actually - getting the things delivered i mean : apart from the deception involved . ^ people are not supposed to be able to go into the flats and deliver stuff through letter boxes . ^ well , that 's what the porter of  um block told us . ^ i reckon he was just being difficult . ^ it meant we could n't do that block , but we did the rest by sneaking in after people who have keys , or by ringing the number of someone we knew and getting them to let us in. a bit cheeky , but we had no other way of getting in ! ! ^ so , i 've now got all my christmas presents for people . ^  ame . ^  ame , that is the result of a great deal of time spent in town . ^  ame and i went at ^  um  um yesterday morning , had lunch at  ame , shopped till we dropped and then went to the cinema to see "  ame 's angels " . ^ i 'd already seen it , but  ame wanted to go to the pictures and it was the only thing vaguely worth watching ! ^ today , after lunch ,  ame and i were getting bored so we went into town again and got the  ame to the airport . ^ i like planes . ^ does it not amaze you how such collosal hunks of machinery ( stuffed full of mechanical parts , people and their luggage ) can get off the ground and  ame ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ^ we had a great ride on the  ame and then went to the airport cafe and had a drink while watching people getting onto the planes . ^ then we went out onto the viewing terrace and watched  um planes take off . ^ we spent about an hour and a half at the airport before getting the  ame back into town and doing a bit of shopping for mam and then walking home . ^ i 'm whacked ! ! ! ^ i still have n't done any uni work . ^ not good . ^ i am just not motivated to get on with it . ^ i 'll probably do some on friday though . ^ ca n't do any tomorrow as  ame and  ame are coming . ^ they 're going to stay over tomorrow night too . ^ i 'm really looking forward to seeing them again ! ^ my  ame 's funeral has been arranged for a week on friday . ^ i think that is really late :  um weeks after she died ! ^ we 're going to go down to  ame for it , so will have to fix up somewhere to stay . ^ i 've never been to a funeral before . ^ my dad 's been asked to do it too . ^ can you imagine doing your on mother 's funeral ? ^ well , what else have i got to say ? ^ nothing much . ^ oh , except : has anything arrived for you in the post yet ? ^ i sent it 2nd class , so it 'll probably take ages . ^ i was n't sure on the address either . ^  ame ! ! ^ well , i have to go . ^ my fish fingers and chips are ready . ^ hope you are having fun , bye for now ,  ame ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
