^ hi &name , &name and &name i 'm slightly confused about the issue of follow-up / literature for the concert . 
^ there is now an advert for the witness cafe , for the &name this term and for the &name service on the back page of the program , however it would be good to eitehr flag this up somehow and to have some kind of literature available . 
^ i suggest that you liaise with &name ( this e-mail it to him as well ) re . 
^ the &name 's gospels and see what you can organise .

^ hi guys ! 
^ i propose : we bring along some &name flyers to have at the back , and some choiceweallface booklets . 
^ as for &name 's gospels : i do n't have them but i guess i should know where they are . 
^ do you want &num copies of &name ? 
^ might be tricky : i 'll see what we 've got . 
^ &name bless ,
