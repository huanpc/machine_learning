^ guys , 
^ just to let you know about training this monday . 
^ we have had a slight change of plan as &name has arranged a practice match against &name . 
^ the only time they can play is at &num but that 's not too bad . 
^ if you guys can get there for &num we will do a gentle warm up and get started at &num . 
^ we will play for &num minutes , have a hard game and then let the 2nds have a run around and get thrashed by &name . 
^ we should be finished by &num and than get boozing . 
^ hopefully this week we can get you guys down to flare . 
^ no excuses this weekguys . 
^ secondly , to all freshers and &name , can you make sure you bring &pound; &num for initiation . 
^ this money helps pay for the booze and other shit that you eat . 
^ the social secs really need this money otherwise they can get nothing . 
^ wednesday at &num is initiation . 
^ thirdly , the senior guys are gradually coming up with nicknames for people . 
^ to all those that want their nicknames on drinking shirts , bring their clean drinking shirts with name penned into the collar , so that i can take them down to shirtworks and get them printed . 
^ wo n't cost much at all . 
^ finally , i mentioned recently about getting tracksuits for oursquad . 
^ sponsorship has fallen through and it will take some time to look else where . 
^ tracksuits are going to cost around &pound; &num with printing . 
^ there are &num different kinds of tracksuits that we are looking at but i will let you guys decide . 
^ majority vote wins . 
^ i am hoping that all of you guys will want them . 
^ after that the expenses towards the hockey club , will be minimal . 
^ anyway we want to be the boys ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ once a decision is made , we will place an order that week . 
^ they will take between &num weeks to come through and should be here late on in the term . 
^ bring the money if you have it on monday . 
^ the sooner we get all the money , the sooner we get the tracksuits . 
^ your choice fellas . 
^ any problems get in touch with me . 
^ i hope to see you out over the weekend guys . 
^ maybe an opportunity to play mixed sunday morning at &name road . 
^ &name place to play and birds will be fit . 
^ yeah right ! ! ! ! 
^ but afterwards maybe a team roast at pub &name up to you guys . 
^ get in touch if interested . 
^ the fury .
