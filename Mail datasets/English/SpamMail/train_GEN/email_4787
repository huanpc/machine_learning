^ again not remembering your herpes address ... 
^ &name ( including bench ) went &num for &num with &num run scored and &num &name yesterday . 
^ &num walks , both on the bench . 
^ meanwhile &name pitches &num run ball for &num innings but the &char 's ca n't beat the tigers , &name pitches &num run ball for &num innings but &name shuts down the &name ( which is why &name was on the bench ) , but the impotent &name offense scores enough off of &name for &name to get the win ... on my bench . 
^ &name and &name with good &char / ip , &name not so much . 
^ this game kills me . 
^ it 's a good thing &name got a save or i might really be pissed .
