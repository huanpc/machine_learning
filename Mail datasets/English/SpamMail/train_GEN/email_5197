^ hi &name , 
^ unless &name minds the dilution of the lkb list a combination of both adresses would be the best option to communicate . 
^ &name now , &email just goes to me , but that 'll presumably change . 
^ cheers , &name 
^ dear &name , 
^ i am finally catching up on my lkb related mail , sorry about the delay . 
^ where is a good place to publicly ask questions about &name ? 
^ would you be happy with the lkb-list , or would you prefer &email or both ? 
^ i would like an address to tell people here in &name .
