^ glads to hear it &name - ca n't understand why your computer was clean as i sent the atachment aas i received it , and only when i was alerted and looked again , i saw that the attachment did n't have a &name but a .emt ( i think that was it - i have deleted it now ! ) which mail administrator intercepted and told me about . 
^ now whether mail administrator took it out before sending the message on , i do n't know - if so it must be awfully clever ! 
^ however my computer does n't seem to be affected so perhaps all is ok &name

^ love &name

^ unfortunately , although the email came from a reputable source to me , hidden in it was a virus , which inadvertantly i must have passed on to you . 
^ i 'm really sorry about this . 
^ however , if it makes you feel better , when i discovered this i ran my virus &name , and &name found nothing . 
^ and my computer seems to be working ok . 
^ but just in case - if you have n't openned it yet - do n't ( &name because the contents were quite good ! ) &name
