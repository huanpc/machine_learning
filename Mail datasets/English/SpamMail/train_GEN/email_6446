^ dear cums members , 
^ i have a friend who has a son who plays the piano by ear but ca n't read or write music . 
^ ( his mother was a pianist graduate of the &name , but he did n't take to formal learning ) . 
^ he has worked out some rather scrummy arrangements of &num hymns and has played them into a computer so that there is a piano version now available . 
^ the " job " on offer is for someone with access to &name " who will take his harmonies and arrange them for the church orchestra . 
^ a list of instruments and standard of the players will be provided . 
^ i have a copy of &num of the &num hymns , plus the brief in more detail , including the opportunity for you to set your fee per hymn . 
^ you will obviously need to see the arrangement and consider the instruments involved before working out a reasonable fee for the job . 
^ i thought with christmas coming up you might &char ) like to earn a bit extra and &char ) might have enough time to do it ! 
^ if you would like to pursue this please let me know , and if you 're in cums i , the chorus or the wind orchestra , i 'll bring a copy of the music and the brief to the rehearsal or concert this week .
