^ the idea is to give you an hour together from the time you leave to the time you return with the last &num minutes ( at least ) given for prayer . 
^ that should give you at least &num minutes to go through the passage . 
^ &name that helps &name 
^ - -on &num may &num &num : &num &num &name &name ( &email ) wrote :

^ if you have n't already signed a &name ( doctrinal basis ) this term , could you sign &num and return it to karuna or me . 
^ i know you 've all signed them before but they need to be re-signed at the start of the new exec / rep year so that the file of them is kept up-to-date .

^ could you please put one in my pigeon hole for me to sign ?

^ also , we were planning to have a slightly longer slot for prayer at the end of &name studies this week . 
^ we 'd aim to have 40-45mins &name and &num praying . 
^ we thought breaking up into &num or &num , praying for some personal applications of the passage , and also for non-christian friends .

^ it 's going to be difficult for &num minutes . 
^ we could n't do the whole thing in &num minutes at training ( we started at &name and finished at 
^ &num 15pm and had n't made it to the end of the passage ) . 
^ allow &num minutes travelling time at each end . 
^ that reduces the time to &num minutes . 
^ &num minutes to settle and read the passage . 
^ that 's half an hour now . 
^ minus &num minutes prayer ( hey , that should probably be more , and certainly one of the things i wanted when i started to do &name &name leading was to increase the time we pray at the end , but within these time pressures that 's not really possible ) . 
^ so that leaves &num minutes for &name 
^ 14: &num . 
^ eek ! 
^ thanks
