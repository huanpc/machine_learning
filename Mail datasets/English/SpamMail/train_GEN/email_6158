^ anyway , that aside , &num things ... 
^ &num ) will someone be at &name to give an update please ? 
^ ( at 4pm ) 
^ yep- &name 's selling tickest , poss &name too- i hope to be there , but if not , just ask one of them ( or both ) &num ) can you let me know what needs to be said at &name ( i.e. ticket sales stuff ... ) there 'll be some on the door , but do n't get there too late ... although it would also be helpful financially if some adults / concessions people arrived before students , as the budget does n't really give us room to allow the &num tickets i mentioned in my last email to be bought for &pound; &num ... something else to pray about and come back to us if you 've thought &char &char anything ...
