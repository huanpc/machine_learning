^ hi everyone 
^ i 've just had a phone call from the soton captain and it appears that their driver is ill and they will not be able to make the match , so the match has been postponed to 4th december . 
^ this means that the first match of the season will be vs. &name away on wednesday 23rd october , probably our hardest fixture in the league this season . 
^ the team i would like to field is : 
^ sabre 
^ &name o' &name &name &name &name &name 
^ foil 
^ &name most &name &name &name &name 
^ &name 
^ &name &name &name &name &name &name 
^ the match time is as yet unconfirmed , and we will be travelling down by train . 
^ i apologise to those of you who were selected for the team this wednesday , and i promise you that you will get your chance later in the season . 
^ as it is we have the large gym free from &num this wednesday so it would be good to have a large turnout of 1st and 2nd team hopefuls ! 
^ see you soon
