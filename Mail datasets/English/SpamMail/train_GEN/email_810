^ &website o73026 
^ when do you want to chat ?

^ " i actually tried to call you yesterday but your phone was engaged for ages . 
^ now &name , i know you 're fairly popular with the ladies and everything , but can you please give me at least a few minutes window time when you are not on the phone to one of them . " 
^ - &name my liege , please forgive your most humble servant for utilising his gift of free internet access . 
^ glad you tried to call , try again . 
^ i 'm at work tomorrow and tuesday , but the phone should be free from &num : 15pm to &num : &name tomorrow , if that 's any way convenient !

^ organic chemistry is actually making sense ! 
^ ( that 's the third of the course which i 've totally ignored up until now ! ) i really quite like it at the moment ; it seems reasonably simple !
