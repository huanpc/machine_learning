^ so does that mean that if you are calling &name in a while loop , the loop will terminate if there is a buffer overrun , and there 's no way to test whether it 's an overrun or &name ?

^ &name . 
^ you are welcome to modify the class to suit your needs . 
<text_embedded> 

^ do you think the buffer size is likely to affect performance significantly ? 
</text_embedded>

^ this depends . 
^ it is a memory buffer so does take some system resources , but depending on how large you make it normally would n't be an issue , ie. 100k even should n't be too big a deal . 
^ it also depends on what other resource demands the rest of your code is making . 
^ eh
