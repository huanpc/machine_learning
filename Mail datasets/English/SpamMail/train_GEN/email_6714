^ dear &name and &name maker support , 
^ greetings from &name 
^ i found a serious error in the &name &num &name builder software . 
^ after using &name &num for years with no problems , last week i bought &name &num . 
^ to my surprise the self-extracting exe-files generated with pa2002-sfx are giving errors and bad file / directory names if the zipped content includes file / directory names using extended ascii-characters , for example the german characters " ' , " ' and " ' . 
^ with &name this never has been a problem . 
^ for further diagnostics &num downloaded the latest &name maker standalone from &website . 
^ i found that this version works nicely with names including foreign characters , so the problem probably comes from &name . 
^ ( however the latest &name standalone has a small problem too , as the " open with &name " button does not work with &name anymore , only with pa2000 ) . 
^ for demonstration and testing i attach a demo zip file including &num files : 
^ &website 
^ - shows how some test files are nicely handled with pa2000 
^ &website 
^ - shows how some test files are nicely handled with &name 
^ &website
