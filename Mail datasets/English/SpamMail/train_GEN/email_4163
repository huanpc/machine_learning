^ dear &name , 
^ i 'm disappointed . 
^ just because you do n't know when your mum 's birthday is either is no good reason not to reply . 
^ &name &name . 
^ dear &name , 
^ unruly elder brothers dealt with , how are you ? 
^ did you get my email after your chapel service ? 
^ how did it go in the end ? 
^ how 's work ? 
^ and everything else ? 
^ generally i 'm fine - my friends are a little bit up and down at the moment and it 's quite hard not to get involved . 
^ i 'm also not doing very well work wise this term which is discouraging , but i 've been thinking about it this evening and have decided there 's no point having a defeatist attitude even when things are difficult . 
^ &name said to treat it as a challenge , and i guess it will be more enjoyable that way . 
^ i 'd better get back to work here , but please email me ( if you have time ) and let me know how you 're doing . 
^ lots of love , 
^ &name xxx
