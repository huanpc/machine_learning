^ hi fellow &name group members ! 
^ for those of you who were there last night , i have found the poem i was talking about : 
^ the &name of the year 
^ i said to the man who stood at the &name of the year " give me a light that i may tread safely into the unknown . " and he replied , " go out into the darkness and put your hand into the hand of &name . 
^ that shall be to you better than light and safer than a known way ! " so i went forth and finding the hand of &name trod gladly into the night . 
^ &char &name &name ( &num ) 
^ fabulous ! 
^ ( if you 're wondering where you might have heard it recently , it was read at the &name mother 's funeral i think . ) 
^ &name x
