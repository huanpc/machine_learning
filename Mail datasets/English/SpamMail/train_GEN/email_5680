^ you will be working with the director from an early stage , working through the text , discussing atmosphere and environment , and coming up with practical and elegant solutions . 
^ furniture and scenery will be sparse , so lighting will be tremendously important in shifting between a variety of settings at a slick , cinematic pace .
