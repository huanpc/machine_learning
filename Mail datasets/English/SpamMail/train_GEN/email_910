^ friends , romans and countrymen , 
^ i am soon to be &num years old . 
^ thus , as the veritable granddaddy of &name 's college , i would like to invite you to celebrate my birthday with me by partaking of food and drink at a local establishment ( not sure where yet - see below ) on sunday march 3rd ( my birthday ) at about &num : &num pm . 
^ the thing is this ... 
^ i need you to reply &name to let me know if you can come , because i need to get a rough idea of numbers before i book anywhere . 
^ also , if i have left somebody off the list it is ( probably ) not deliberate ! 
^ so please invite them as well , but &name me know ! 
^ finally , please do n't feel obliged to come . 
^ if you ca n't afford a meal out , or you need to work , etc. then that is fine - i 'll just catch up with you another time . 
^ the &name , 
^ &name
