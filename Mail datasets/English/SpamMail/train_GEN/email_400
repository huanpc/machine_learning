^ dear &name , 
^ &name , sorry i did n't receive your latest e-mail until now . 
^ i guess i missed chatting in a chatroom . 
^ that 's a shame as it would have been great fun ! 
^ thanks for your e-mail ! 
^ very well , i relent you may assume i am intuitive ! 
^ however , i must point out that being male does not place me in a separate species from you . 
^ you see , i actually believe that you , too , are human . 
^ please return this courtesy . 
^ " airplane is a good film there are more in that genre . 
^ we will rent them next term . 
^ - my incredulity abounds . 
^ &name , yes i agree that airplane is a good film ( generally ) but are there really more of the same genre ? 
^ that seems slightly far-fetched . 
^ anyway , i would take great pleasure in renting similar videos next term . 
^ may i say that i found the opening scene absolutely hilarious , when the aeroplane was likened to a shark . 
^ fantastically funny ! 
^ what do you mean by saying that your family liked the idea of your christmas presents ? 
^ are you trying to tell me they thought it was a lovely idea we all sent presents to each other , or am i getting a completely wrong idea ? 
^ 'my dad found the whole tim-giving-us-photos-he'd-taken-himself thing quite amusing . 
^ my dad can relate to that . 
^ - yes it was extremely nice to receive those presents from &name . 
^ he is extremely clever / economical . 
^ do n't you think ? 
^ i can see why your dad might find the idea amusing . 
^ i rather think my family did too although they cannot relate to it . 
^ " bored , watching lots of trashy tv . 
^ what you up to ? 
^ do n't do anything i would n't do 
^ - yes , i 'm a little bored too . 
^ it is quite lonely being at home all day with nobody to talk too except oneself and the fridge . 
^ the unpleasant idea of chemistry textbooks looming over the rest of the day is slightly depressing . 
^ what on earth can you be watching on television ? 
^ i can find nothing of much interest save " friends on friday evening and &name &name tomorrow . 
^ well , i 'm trying to study as much as i can psychologically cope with , but i 'm going to be working in my dad 's bookshop on wednesday and friday this week . 
^ that should give me a welcome break from the hallowed halls of chemistry . 
^ i 'm going to be spending the new year up in the scottish highlands &name , and may possibly be going skiing . 
^ last time i skied i fell over . 
^ i was about &num . 
^ i did n't much care for it and have never been back since . 
^ i hope i do n't fall down this time as it would be infinitely more embarrassing ! 
^ anyway , i am also looking forward to going on the internet much more as we are changing our &name to one which provides a totally free service . 
^ incidentally , are you aware of the fact that we may quite well owe &name &char &pound; &num at the beginning of next term ? 
^ &char is quite disastrous really 
^ as you ought to have been aware , i began defrosting our freezer the morning you left &name ! ! ! 
^ ( just kidding although watching ice melt is incredibly more exciting than the paint drying process . ) anyway , back to the story well , i asked &name downstairs if we could store our freezer contents in their freezer . 
^ she said absolutely not , promptly pulled out a revolver , and shot me right between the eyes i 'm now dead . 
^ no ! 
^ really &name , you should n't believe such fantastically unrealistic tales ! 
^ dear , dear , dear ! 
^ you 're just so gullible ! 
^ ( just kidding ! ) anyway , she said certainly we could , so we did . 
^ now , that was at about 11am and the freezer did n't finish defrosting until &name . 
^ ( mainly because i never bothered to turn it off whilst leaving the door open and placing large bowls of hot water inside it ! ) when i finally got around to retrieving our frozen food , &name had gone home ! 
^ so had &name ! 
^ &name i was deserted ! ! ! 
^ i was in dire straits , so i well , i wonder , what could i have ( feasibly ) done ? 
^ most likely nothing , but you may imagine something ridiculous if you like . 
^ &name suggested i promptly said " oh bother ? ? ? 
^ and tripped over my own feet . 
^ i think that 's a little harsh . 
^ so , &name &char now has about &num kilos of our frozen chips , along with multiple loaves of bread ! 
^ the real trouble ( yes , seriously ! ) is that &name happened to mention the fee for storage in their freezer was &pound; &num per hour . 
^ this did not concern be greatly as i assumed she was joking , and even if she had turned out to be serious , it would only have cost us about &pound; &num . 
^ however , now that we are utilising her storage facilities over christmas , it would cost our flat &pound; &num . 
^ this would lower our flat bank account balance by about &num - not a healthy way to start the term ! 
^ the second little flat story which i shall tell you is probably one you have heard from &name or someone else . 
^ just in case you have not i would like to make you aware of the fact that on saturday morning &name and &name came to visit and , whilst &name was engaged in polite conversation with &name , &name and &char ( and various parents ) &name was redesigning our water closet . 
^ it appeared , from subsequent ( although not very close as &name had just cleaned it warning ! 
^ &name ! ! ) inspection that the entire visit had been a ruse , the sole purpose of which was to maliciously " blacken the reputation of our " spotless toilet . 
^ on reflection and long consultation with &name and &name we decided that they had facilitated the effects desired by themselves by pouring something akin to the nature and properties of food colouring down our lavatory . 
^ this distressed and perplexed us greatly . 
^ we are still distressed and perplexed greatly . 
^ sleepless nights have been our lot ever since . 
^ seriously . 
^ i now expect you to be distressed and perplexed . 
^ greatly . 
^ do n't disappoint my &name . 
^ i 'm counting on your being perplexed . 
^ in conclusion i would like to say that i 'm not really sure whether or not i 'll do anything you would n't do . 
^ in fact , i can think of quite a few things i do which you would n't do and am not quite sure it would be advisable to refrain from doing them. ( ! ) now &name , i have just written you a long e-mail . 
^ i know you are a very busy person ( quote : [ &num 'm] " bored ) and i am extremely grateful that you should take the time to e-mail me ( seriously , seriously , no sarcasm ) as i really enjoy reading them , but could you try and write a slightly longer &num next time ? 
^ if you 'd rather not or do n't have time then okay . 
^ &name , i probably should n't have said that ! 
^ ( i 'm not being judgmental , so please do n't plot to kill me ! ) 
^ see you , 
^ &name 
^ &name i really liked your scottish accent on the " phone the other night . 
^ it was most convincing ! 
^ perhaps you can write in the language of the gods also ?
