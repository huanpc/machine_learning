<text_embedded> 

^ so far , i played with the &name , i am going to implement the real stuff soon . 
^ a snapshot of what the dialog will look like is at 
^ &website 
</text_embedded>

^ does " remove scheme ... " really bring up another dialog ? 
^ why ? 
^ if it does n't, the ellipsis is wrong . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ actually not , it is a cut&paste error . 
^ i am using the " colors " panel as a reference , since i think having the same interface would reinforce predictability of the &num panels . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ there is no visual association with the scheme selector and the actual items contained within the scheme ( which i assume are the fonts above . 
^ for example , there 's no way to work out if the anti-aliasing settings are in the scheme or not ( i guess not , but the user should not have to guess , they shoould be given visual hints ) . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i 'd say that antialias setting should be set independently , however , seeing that in the control center the contrast setting is packed with the colors , i think i should save the antialias setting with the scheme . 
</text_normal>

^ what is the use case for " import scheme " ? 
^ will drag and drop work ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ import scheme should open a file requester , and add a pre-packaged scheme to the list and the user configuration directory . 
^ i have not thought about drag and drop yet . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ why does save scheme exist at all ? 
^ you already have a " &name " button . 
^ the scheme should be saved on clicking ok , and changes abandoned on &name . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ save scheme is needed to add a new scheme to the preset list . 
^ the user selects her preferred fonts and then clicks on 'save scheme ... " . 
^ &char pop up asks for a name , and the scheme is added to the list . 
^ the &name requesters above assume the role of a preview of the fonts . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ how does a user create a * new * scheme ? 
^ i 'm not sure the repetition of 'scheme " in the scheme group box is a good idea . 
^ the visual context should disambiguate ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ 'save " is already used by the panel ... 
^ if you have some better idea for the labels , i am open to suggestions . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &num possibility would be : |--font scheme------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | | my scheme | / | | ----------------- | general : | . . ... |

^ i am sorry , but i am not sure i understand your ascii art . 
^ do you prefer the scheme selector to be grouped with the font requesters , is that it ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ regards &name 
^ p.s. what does the mnemonic for &name actually do ? 
^ it seems a bit odd for a group box . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name , i do n't know , but that is not my doing . 
^ it 's been there all the time .
