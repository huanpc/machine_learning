^ dear all , 
^ unlucky result and unhappy refereeing -though we need to keep our heads cooler too , she said . 
^ &name determination , though , and more matches to go . 
^ now , the most popular subject on the web : formal hall ! 
^ notwithstanding the dreadful rumours that stenched the peaceful solace of our agreed date ( &name ! ) , formal hall is taking place this wednesday . 
^ be quick ! 
^ sign up now ! 
^ i have n't been able to warn the catering manager that he 's been invaded by hordes of hungry dinos+dragons , coz he 's sick , but i 'll do that tomorrow . 
^ and -bugger- i need someone to sign up an extra guest , since a friend of mine , &name , is coming and each of us can only sign &num guests . 
^ so , the following are guests ( in parenthesis , the &name member signing them up ) . 
^ &name ( &name ) &name , &name ( &name ) &name &name ( &name ? ) &name my guest ! 
^ ( i 'll pay , but need someone to adopt her ) &name ( &name ) 
^ please fill in gaps as you feel and forward it to the list so that we know when we are done . 
^ i might also be forgetting people so please let all know if that 's the case i 'm certainly thinking the dragons will take care of themselves . 
^ &name , 
^ &name
