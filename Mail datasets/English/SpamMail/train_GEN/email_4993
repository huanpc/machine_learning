^ hi &name , 
^ i am in &name , back from visiting the other &num &name programs , and would like to come down to visit &name at some time over the next few days . 
^ ideally , this would occur on a day in which there is an &name meeting , so that i could attend that as well , and then maybe talk to you before or afterwards . 
^ i was wondering if you knew whether an &name meeting was scheduled for tomorrow or monday ( &name said the one for today was postponed ) , and if not , whether either of those &num days you would be available to chat if i came down to &name . 
^ anyway , i hope all is well . 
^ i should be hearing from &name relatively soon , so i 'll let you know about that as soon as i hear . 
^ &name
