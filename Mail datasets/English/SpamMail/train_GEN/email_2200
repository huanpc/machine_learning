" and 'do you have to sign a form to become a christian ? " joking aside though , i enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . ^ consequently i enjoyed a much more respectable  um or  um hours sleep each night . ^ more importantly , one of the children made a commitment to  ame , which was wonderful . ^ last tuesday evening we all played  ame outside in the grounds of the country house we stayed in.  um had to dress up as a  ame , and this i did with some relish . ^ yesterday evening i went to a concert in  ame . ^ the  ame  ame philharmonic orchestra was playing . ^ this afternoon i 've been with my family to  ame - a nearby country house . ^ it is very warm today and i like it . ^ we had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . ^ tomorrow morning i begin my new job for  um weeks . ^ i will be working from  um o' clock until  um in the lab , and i am quite looking forward to it although i hope it will not be too boring . ^ what have you been doing ? ^ did your sister go back to  ame last friday ? ^ did you enjoy your day-trip to  ame ? ^ guess what , i 'm thinking of buying a  ame rewriter . ^  ame , today has been a most lovely day . ^ it 's beautifully sunny here , and sweet gentle breeze is blowing across the fields containing ripened grain . ^ ( although i guess i shall be fed up with grain soon ! ) ^  ame , would you like to come up to  ame and visit me for a day in the near future ? ^ let me know , as i would like to see you again sometime ! ^ peace and blessings be unto you . ^  ame ^ ( i 'm happy ! ) ^  ame does the pink t-shirt , which  ame gave you for your birthday , have " happy " written in white writing , with a little ( slightly skewed ) smiling face to the right of it ? </text_normal></message_body></message>
