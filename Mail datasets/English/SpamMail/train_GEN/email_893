^ hi &name ! 
^ are you busy working ? 
^ i am intending to begin today . 
^ intending being the operative word . 
^ it is quite cold here in &name , but my parents have kindly said i may put the heating on if i begin to freeze . 
^ i spend most of yesterday getting all my stuff unpacked - quite a task . 
^ i 'm having chicken risotto for lunch ; and looking forward to it immensely . 
^ last night i watched an episode of voyager - a very good one actually . 
^ i 'm hoping you 're sitting at your desk with &name when you receive this so that you can reply , but perhaps you 're not . 
^ by the way , whatever you did to &name seems to have worked . 
^ i do n't have to log in when i start up any more ! 
^ the new backgrounds are lovely too . 
^ so , how is everyone in college ? 
^ how many of you are still left ? 
^ is it lonely ? 
^ what do you think of &name more or less without its students ? 
^ did you go to &name 's house yesterday ? 
^ hope you have a good day . 
^ &name
