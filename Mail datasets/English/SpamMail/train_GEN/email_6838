^ i saw &name last night , she has n't been very well for the last couple of weeks and was still rather " under the weather' - do pray for her . 
^ she said that so far , she had &num volunteers to steward- which is n't really enough , although we 're still trying other people ... if any of you on the exec would like to help in this way , and if this would n't prevent your non-c friends from coming , that would really be appreciated- please could you let &name ( rrt25 ) know if that 's poss ?

^ i 've asked the exec , and they could n't decide right now , but they 'll either be e-mailing to get tickets for them and friends , or will e-mail &name to offer to help &name . ... 
^ &name this is ok .
