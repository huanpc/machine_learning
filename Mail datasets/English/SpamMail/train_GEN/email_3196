" and  ame  ame gave an extremely profound and insightful response . ^ she said " i believe that  ame is deeply saddened by this just as we are , but for years we 've been telling  ame to get out of our schools , to get out of our government and to get out of our lives . ^ and being the gentleman that he is , i believe that he has calmly backed out . ^ how can we expect  ame to give us his blessing and his protection if we demand that he leave us alone ? " i know there 's been a lot of emails going around in regard to  um /  um /  um , but this really makes you think . ^ if you do n't have time , at least skim through it , but the bottom line is something to think about . ... in light of recent events ... terrorists attack , school shootings , etc. let 's see , i think it started when  ame  ame o'  ame ( she was murdered , her body was found recently ) complained she did n't want any prayer in our schools , and we said ok . ^ then , someone said you better not read the  ame in school ... the bible that says thou shalt not kill , thou shalt not steal , and love your neighbour as yourself . ^ and we said , ok . ^ then , dr.  ame  ame said we should n't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem ( dr.  ame 's son committed suicide ) and we said , an expert should know what he 's talking about so we said ok . ^ then , someone said teachers and principals better not discipline our children when they misbehave . ^ and the school administrators said no faculty member in this school better touch a student when they misbehave because we do n't want any bad publicity , and we surely do n't want to be sued ( there 's big difference between disciplining and touching , beating , smacking , humiliating , kicking , etc. ) and we said , ok . ^ then someone said , let 's let our daughters have abortions if they want , and they wo n't even have to tell their parents . ^ and we said , ok . ^ then some wise school board member said , since boys will be boys and they 're going to do it anyway , let 's give our sons all the condoms they want , so they can have all the fun they desire , and we wo n't have to tell their parents they got them at school . ^ and we said , ok . ^ then some of our top elected officials said it does n't matter what we do in private as long as we do our jobs . ^ and agreeing with them , we said it does n't matter to me what anyone , including the president , does in private as long as i have a job and the economy is good . ^ and then someone said let 's print magazines with pictures of nude women and call it wholesome , down-to-earth appreciation for the beauty of the female body . ^ and we said , ok . ^ and then someone else took that appreciation a step further and published pictures of nude children and then stepped further still by making them available on the  ame . ^ and we said ok , they 're entitled to their free speech . ^ and then the entertainment industry said , let 's make tv shows and movies that promote profanity , violence , and illicit sex . ^ and let 's record music that encourages rape , drugs , murder , suicide , and satanic themes . ^ and we said it 's just entertainment , it has no adverse effect , and nobody takes it seriously anyway , so go right ahead . ^ now we 're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience , why they do n't know right from wrong , and why it does n't bother them to kill strangers , their classmates , and themselves . ^ probably , if we think about it long and hard enough , we can figure it out . ^ i think it has a great deal to do with " we reap what we  ame . " 'dear  ame , why did n't you save the little girl killed in her classroom ? ^ "  ame ,  ame  ame ... and the reply 'dear  ame  ame , i am not allowed in schools . "  ame ,  ame . ^ funny how simple it is for people to trash  ame and then wonder why the world 's going to hell . ^ funny how we believe what the newspapers say , but question what the  ame says . ^ funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not have to believe , think , say , or do anything the  ame says . ^ funny how someone can say " i believe in  ame " but still follow  ame who , by the way , also " believes " in  ame . ^ funny how we are quick to judge but not to be judged . ^ funny how you can send a thousand " jokes " through e-mail and they spread like wildfire , but when you start sending messages regarding the  ame , people think twice about sharing . ^ funny how the lewd , crude , vulgar and obscene pass freely through cyberspace but the public discussion of  ame is suppressed in the school and workplace . ^ funny how someone can be so fired up for  ame on sunday , but be an invisible christian the rest of the week . ^ are you laughing ? ^ funny how when you go to forward this message , you will not send it to many on your address list because you 're not sure what they believe , or what they will think of you for sending it to them . ^ funny how i can be more worried about what other people think of me than what  ame thinks of me . ^ are you thinking ? ^ pass it on if you think it has merit . ^ if not then just discard it . ... no one will know that you did . ^ but , if you discard this thought process , then do n't sit back and complain about what a bad shape the world is in. here is a challenge - will you take it up ? ^ get your free download of  ame explorer at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
