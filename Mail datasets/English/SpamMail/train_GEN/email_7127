^ dear &name of cums &char & chorus , &name , &name and &name , 
^ it was a wonderful concert - a real &name wallow ! ! 
^ i loved it all , from the opening bars of the concerto to the closing bars of the requiem . 
^ i thought &name and &name did a really beautiful job on the concerto , especially the slow movement ( scrummy ! ) and the chorus sounded really confident and meaty in the requiem . 
^ the orchestra played its collective socks off all evening and you must all by now be pretty tired ! 
^ thank you for all the hard work which went into it . 
^ and thank you too to everyone who stayed to help clear away , and for producing a really helpful bunch of stewards ! 
^ also to &name and &name for organising the party afterwards . 
^ i shall look forward to seeing most of the chorus again tomorrow ( 7.30pm - 9pm in &name road ) and cums i at the beginning of next term . 
^ we 're trying to fix a pre-term rehearsal ( or maybe &num , with a curry supper between them ) on monday &num january . 
^ it would be helpful to know if anyone would have any difficulty with that . 
^ it has been suggested because the &name / ravel / &name programme is pretty challenging and there are only &num tuesdays . 
^ it would be really good to have played through most of the music before the first tuesday . 
^ finally - another request for cums &name i noticed that when we had a show of hands for the trip to &name yesterday a number of violinists did n't put up their hands . 
^ if you 're absolutely sure that you wo n't be able to go , please would you let me know , because i might as well start inviting other violinists now rather than wait until the 21st january and then spring it on them ! 
^ if i do n't see you again have a lovely break and a very happy christmas if that 's appropriate ! 
^ best wishes , &name
