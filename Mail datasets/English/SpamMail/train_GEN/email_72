^ just to let you know that your cotag cards should now allow you access to the intel lab ( big room full of machines on the other end of the top floor from the &name rooms ) . 
^ this may be useful if you want access to a &name machine ( or , when the weather is better , if you 'd like to sit on the balcony watching the horses ... ) if you do use the lab , please note that , though it 's rarely full , there are times when it 's used intensively and undergraduates and diploma students always have priority .
