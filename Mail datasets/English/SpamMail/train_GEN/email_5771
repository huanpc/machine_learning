^ just to let i know i have a very important assignment this week on top of being a tape sec and all that for life and taking people and going to prayer meetings & &name ahhhhhhhhh . 
^ i 'm afraid that &name will have to take lowest priority at least until i 've handed in my project . 
^ i wo n't be there tomorrow night because of our college event . 
^ &name 's coming ( &num doing the &name bit ) so please pray that &name speaks to her . 
^ sorry to have to put this on the back burner in the most important week but i 'm here primarily to get a degree . 
^ just a shame that the project , life and &name all conspired to be in the same week . 
^ saturday &char may be able to do something but not counting on it . 
^ sunday i will if i have n't dropped dead by then ! ! 
^ hope tomorrow goes well .
