^ &name email , but hey ! 
^ i do n't know how many of you have heard of &name , but they are a really great christian band from &name , whose first album ( 'downhere " ) is just brilliant .. plus , they are really nice guys , having talked to them online and on their message board i can say they are like many christian bands in that they 're really humble and incredibly ready to talk to their fans , only even more so than most ! 
^ really cool guys . 
^ so , even if you have n't heard of them ... would you like to meet them ? 
^ they will be in &name 2nd-4th december and i promised &name ( the drummer ) i would sound out among my friends ( and their friends , hint hint , anyone else you know who 'd like to come ? ) whether there would be interest in doing a proper 'meet and greet " thing while they 're here . 
^ many of you may not be able to come ( i 'm thinking of my friends in far flung places ! ) but you might know someone who could come . 
^ i 'm hoping to go and meet them anyway , but it would be cool to have some sort of official thing so uk downhere fans could get to meet them and chat with them . 
^ so if you 're vaguely interested in meeting some really great guys who also happen to be talented musicians , then let me know ! 
^ sadly they 're not playing this time &smiley but hey , if their promoters hear they 've got loads of british fans then maybe next time ... 
^ ok , random enough ? 
^ * grin * 
^ pass it on ... 
^ love &name xx
