^ hi 
^ hope you 're both well and surviving term ! 
^ as you 'll be aware , the next &name concert it approaching rapidly ( with practically &num stress to yourselves ! ) and as last year it 's just the last minute rush now . 
^ we 're just a little desperate for stewards and i was wondering if there was anybody in &name who 'd like to do it this year , given that we had a number last year from &name ? 
^ if there is anybody who would like to do this ( or have further questions ) then if they could contact me by e-mail , that would be grand . 
^ many thanks , 
^ love &name
