^ hi 
^ i got an email asking how the same &name file could be associated with both a &name and a &name &name schema at the same time ( without editing the &name file) . 
^ the answer is that this is not technically possible -- for this practical you can comment things in and out of your files . 
^ here 's the long answer : 
^ &name and &name &name are alternative schema languages , and in no real-world application would anybody have both associated with the same file , as i asked you to do for this exercise . 
^ thus , the &name specifications do not define an elegant syntax to connect an &name file to both . 
^ in the practical , you will have to comment the doctype declaration ( and for later answers , certain processing instructions ( &name ) in and out of the &name file during this exercise -- send the final &name file with all lines in it , but commented out , i will be able to figure out what you meant . 
^ as a reminder : &name validation needs a hard-wired doctype declaration in the &name document . 
^ use &name to validate . 
^ relaxng validation works with the program jing -- give it the relaxng schema as a parameter , and comment the doctype declaration out . 
^ &name this clarifies things-- &name 
^ &name : &num small remark about what you said -- you said that if you omit the doctype declaration , your &name is valid . 
^ this is not the case -- for validity you need a schema by definition ! 
^ what you probably meant is that the parser does not complain , but in the given case this only means the &name is well-formed -- the parser automatically switches to a well-formed parse only if it finds no doctype declaration . 
^ if there is a doctype declaration , the stakes are higher , and several things must now hold : the dtd must exist , must comply with &name syntax rules , and must correctly describe the structure of the &name instance .
