^ while gathering the votes , the teacher noted that one quiet student had n't turned in her paper yet . 
^ so she asked the girl if she was having trouble with her list . 
^ the girl replied , " yes , a little . 
^ i could n't quite make up my mind because there were so many . " the teacher said , " well , tell us what you have , and maybe we can help . " the girl hesitated , then read , " i think the &num wonders of the world are : &num . 
^ to touch &num . 
^ to taste &num . 
^ to see &num . 
^ to hear ( she hesitated a little , and then added&smiley &num . 
^ to feel &num .
