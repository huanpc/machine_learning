^ guys i 've just sent out an e-mail to everyone who helps with the &name flyering , asking if they can help on saturday . 
^ the e-mail was cc 'd to all of you , so can see the details too . 
^ i 've just chatted to a couple of people and they suggested a couple of things : 
^ &num ) have you sent out an advert on the music faculty list ? 
^ i suggest that this should be done tomorrow if it has n't, and should be sent to the faculty tonight so that they it and send it out on their lists tomorrow . 
^ &num ) &name &name at &name college ( &email , &num &num ) was very involved ( i think he coordinated it ) in flyering for the &name event . 
^ why not rope him in , or at least ask him for some top tips ! 
^ &num ) are there any concerts happening tomorrow that we can flyer at ? 
^ shout if there are and if you need any help doing that . 
^ finally , i know that some of you ( esp . 
^ &name ) were in the &name . 
^ do you know how tickets sold for that , i.e. when the majority sold ? 
^ on the door ? 
^ much beforehand ? 
^ last minute ? 
^ this might give us an indication of how we 're doing and if we need to push selling tickets more . 
^ think that 's it for now . 
^ &name : i will e-mail you very soon re . 
^ on-the-door ticket prices , once i 've spoken to &name &name . 
^ do keep me informed ! 
^ love &name
