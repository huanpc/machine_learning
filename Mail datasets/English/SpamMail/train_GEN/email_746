^ thanks for your little message . 
^ i was much amused and immediately summoned my brother to show him ! 
^ i just do n't know what 's got into &name - she used to be so harmless and seemingly docile . 
^ oh well , i suppose it just goes to show that the only person you can trust is a potato . 
^ so , i assume you are well &name . 
^ my phone has broken - it now rings at about &num / &num rd the volume that it used to , so i ca n't hear it . 
^ but there is a service centre in &name , where they should be able to fix it for free ! 
^ &name !
