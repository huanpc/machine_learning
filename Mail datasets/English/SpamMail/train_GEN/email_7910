^ i told my supervisor that personnel said my holiday was ok but she was n't pleased but gave me this form to fill in anyway . 
^ i 'm not mentioning &char in the park again - i 'll just work around it with sickies or something . 
^ and the proclaimers are n't that old - in their &num or something . 
^ but who cares ? 
^ they 're still magic . 
^ &name , i 'm so knackered - i 've been sleeping for ages but i was n't supposed to cuz i want to get the first book in &name of the rings finished tonight . 
^ and oh my &name , i ca n't believe &name is gone . 
^ i 'm sure i got to the second book the first time i tried to read it but i so do n't remember them losing him . 
^ &name , too much excitement . 
^ i also want to watch &name tonight to see &name cuz he 's so luvly . 
^ i watched go yesterday but he 's not so good in it cuz he puts on a stoopid " darkie " accent . 
^ ( i hate that word but ca n't be arsed thinking how else to put it ) on the plus side his hair is short and he 's &char . 
^ nice that way . 
^ i think i 'll be watching the craft at some point tomorrow but he 's nasty in that - but still god damn nice . 
^ i 'm quite pissed off cuz &name 's sent me some attachment and &num downloaded it but now ca n't find it . 
^ i can never get downloads probably . 
^ oh and i forogt to tell you but guess who i 'm working with ? 
^ &name &name - remember her from last year who always talked about bloody &name ? 
^ well , she started the same day as me but she has n't mentioned the " &char " word yet so we 're ok . 
^ i got a magic job today anyway , well , as magic as a job can be in that place . 
^ i 'd been trimming for about &num mins when the chargehand put me on the sealer , so for the rest of the day me and this other quine were taking turns feeding and taking packets from the machine . 
^ boring as hell but piss easy and no one breathing down your neck . 
^ boost . 
^ at the end of the day she told me that we 'd sealed more than &num packets of fish that day . 
^ bloody hell . 
^ anyway , that 's it . 
^ i 'll ask mam what music she 's on about . 
^ she did sing it to me but it could be tricky relaying it over the internet , so you 'll maybe have to wait for a phone call . 
^ &name 
^ &name 
^ ps ok , i though i 'd sent this earlier so it 's now a bit out of date but i ca n't be buggered writing a new one at the moment so this will have to do .
