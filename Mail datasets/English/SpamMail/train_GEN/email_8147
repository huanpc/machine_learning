^ &num ) the &num missing .rmrs files are now in the same directory as the others - there should be no further changes or additions 
^ &website which contains lines of the form 
^ base &name &name ... derivedn 
^ where the base is always a verb ( because i 've only done things which can be taken to have a base verb ) and the derived forms are mostly nouns ( but there 's the occasional adjective ) e.g. 
^ &name &name 
^ it only contains forms where either the base form or a derived form is in the questions . 
^ note that i 've entered the ing " forms as &char since that 's how the &name treats them when they occur prenominally ( the &name will generally treat these as derived , however , so you get the base relation and a nominalize_rel) . 
^ however , &name at least sometimes tags them as adjectives and does n't treat them as derived . 
^ some zero-derived forms are included . 
^ the file was created semi-automatically and is no doubt buggy in some respects 
^ - if you improve it , you should make this clear in your writeup and include the improved version with the code you submit . 
^ &name
