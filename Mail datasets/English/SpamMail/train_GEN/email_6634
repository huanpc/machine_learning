^ dear sir or madam , 
^ i am working with a client of mine ( &name &name , hence the use of his e-mail account ) to update his computer for the latest security patches , virus updates etc. 
^ he is an owner of &name &name &num , and on saturday 5th january &num , i ordered an annual subscription for the virus updates ( priced $ &num ) . 
^ the order number was &num . 
^ however , now &name &name is insisting that the subscription has expired ( claiming &num / &num / &num ) for account id &num . 
^ indeed in the help about box , it is recorded that the subscription started on &num / &num / &num and will expire in &num days . 
^ how can i get it to recognise the subscription purchased in january in order to update the computer with liveupdate ? 
^ many thanks , 
^ &name &name
