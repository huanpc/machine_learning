^ i agree . 
^ the other question is whether you need to indicate in the catalogs how many inputs union has - but i wonder if we can figure that out without being explicitly told , upon recreation of the network .

^ i presume that the &name representation of a union could look like a unary box rather than an n-ary box . 
^ and the number of real inputs can be automatically determined by the number of incoming arcs . 
^ i think by doing so , the &name programmers do n't need to specify the number of inputs manually . 
^ &name , in that case , the difference between union and other unaries is that for a unary box of other types , you cannot link &num arcs to the input port whereas you can have more than one incoming arcs for a union . 
^ do you guys agree with me ? 
^ thanks ,

^ union replaces merge , and takes no arguments . 
^ but &name people will have to request the number of input ports .

^ sorry " bout leaving off &name , i just replied to an old email . 
^ i would assume that merge is the same thing as union . 
^ does anyone at &name disagree ?

^ hey &name , could you include &name in these emails ? 
^ he 's coding the box properties dialogs . 
^ additionally , we have a box called 'merge " . 
^ is this the same operator as union ? 
^ it is always easy for us to provide a simple textfield interface for any of the operators -- as long as you type in something without the interface help it 's okay . 
^ so we can provide that really fast , and then think of a more complex dialog . 
^ &name 
^ &name guys - 
^ we will be implementing &name . 
^ the &name &name needs to take input from a variable number of input streams and put them together into &num fat output stream . 
^ i do n't think that this should be too hard on your end but it would help if the &name supported it so that i can test it sufficiently . 
^ let me know if you need any information about this or when you are done . 
^ thanks .
