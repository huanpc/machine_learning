^ hey &name , 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ um , not quite . 
^ we 've split up - my decision . 
^ it 's a long story , but you 'll probably have to wait for my biography to be written ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name me a copy will you . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ hope your life is less traumatic ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i guess i have n't had to go through an engagement break-up , but my life is pretty traumatic in other ways ! 
^ i can definitely relate to trauma !

^ when they talk about &name , do they discuss how much of it can be done with clever pattern spotting ? 
^ is this &name ? 
^ &name [ &num marks ] 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name .. &name ... dunno really ... i guess ... like ... they sort-of like ... talk about stuff . 
^ ( i 'd give myself &num for that . ) 
^ i suppose in some ways it 's all about pattern-spotting of sorts , just depends whether the patterns are 'deep " or 'shallow " . 
^ the basic framework is usually something like : 
^ lexical analysis ( proper-name / date-spotting , etc. ) - ) syntactic analysis - ) &name ( predicate-based ) relational analysis ( semantic expansion? * ) - ) &name / stochastic comparison 
^ * synonym / hypernym / hyponym conceptual expansion 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ but i do feel they are missing the point , in places . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes , i suppose the problem is that it 's difficult to draw a box around what &name actually is . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ how 's the project work proceeding ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ have n't really started the main project yet - that begins next term , but i will have to decide fairly shortly what i 'm going to do . 
^ am hoping to be inspired by something ( soon ) . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ ps i might be down in &name in early march , to play go . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name ! 
^ tell me when and i 'll see if i can come along . 
^ all the best &name , 
^ &name
