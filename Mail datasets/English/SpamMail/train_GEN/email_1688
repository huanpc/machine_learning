" how many people will be asking you that i wonder ? ^ i 'm enjoying living in the flat ; it 's good fun so far and so is my placement . ^ i 'm doing research on coatings for paint - which is much more interesting than it sounds honestly ! ^ i say 'doing " , but i have n't really started yet due to  um thing and another . ^ most of my time so far has been spent reading patents and being inducted . ^ there are a few other students working there too , so that 's nice . ^ we were supposed to start doing some experiments today but then it was pointed out we did n't have safety footwear , so that required a little trip out to buy some maybe tomorrow will see some work ^ wonderfully , i do n't have to get up at 6am every day any more ! ^ i 've found someone who works there and lives in  ame , so he gives me a lift there and back . ^ sorry i have n't emailed much - internet access has been rather difficult as college is the nearest online place for me and i only manage to check it once or twice a week ! ^ however , i now have a computer at work so that should make things easier . ^ my family has been staying with me last week . ^ they were having a holiday in and around  ame . ^ last sunday  ame and his family came to visit for the evening . ^ we all went out for a meal to  ame  ame , and  ame and i also went to visit  ame  ame . ^  ame wanted to try and look around  ame  har , but it was locked . ^ however ,  ame i was open so we wandered in there and looked around a little - most bizarre ! ^ we also had a little look in  ame  ame ^  ame to hear from you sometime . ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
