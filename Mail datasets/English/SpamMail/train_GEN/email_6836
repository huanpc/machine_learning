^ hi &name &name the prayer meeting went well yesterday afternoon . 
^ &name said that you had a good time . 
^ &num questions . 
^ &num ) the exec were asking me yesterday if they will have any jobs to do ( helping out / stewarding etc ) at the event , or whether they 're not needed at all , in which case they will buy tickets and invite friends . 
^ please let me know as soon as you can so i can let them know . 
^ we are all very willing to help if anything at all needs doing though , so just let me know . 
^ &num ) we 'll have our last exec meeting before the concert event tomorrow ( mon ) night , so if there 's anything you 'd like us to help with ( from &name ) , anything you 'd like us to discuss or decide , or anything that you 'd like me to update or brief the exec on ( it 'd be especially good to have an update so we all know where everything 's at and can be praying appropriately ) please e-mail me before &name mon night . 
^ &num ) i will be looking after &name ( meeting him , bringing him to the right place , praying with him ( and some of you guys as well hopefully ! ) etc. ) i 'm assuming that i 'd better buy a ticket as well though so i can sit down !
