<text_embedded> 

^ i 'm sticking with my original answer , since i was answering for the particular word * sense * ( not orthography ) you cited .

</text_embedded>

^ &name ... that 's a horrible thing to say . 
^ &smiley unless you meant great in terms of mass or volume or general quantity . 
^ in which case , i 'm in full agreement . 
</text_embedded>

^ i have no idea what you mean by this - be it good , bad or rabbit-like . 
^ however , i 'll terminate this thread with " what you said may have some relevance " 
</text_embedded>

^ you mean you do n't want me to explain ? 
^ it was quite simple really : i asked if you were worried you 'd waste away . 
^ you said it 'd be no " great loss " . 
^ i said that was horrible , unless you meant the loss of your actual physical mass . 
^ which * wouldn't * be a * great * loss simply &name there 's not much of you ! 
^ see ? 
^ &name .
