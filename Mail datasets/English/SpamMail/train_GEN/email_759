^ &num &name , &num &name , &num &name , &num &name , &num &name . 
^ if not , please tell me . 
^ i am able to bring &num pull-cords for the lights in the bathroom and toilet . 
^ i hope this is agreeable . 
^ the current &num are forbidden by department of environmental health legislation . 
^ and no , before you ask , i did n't check . 
^ oh , i am looking forward to living in this flat . 
^ do you have any ideas for the name which should appear on our cheque book ?
