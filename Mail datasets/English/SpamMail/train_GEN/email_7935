^ &name 's sake . 
^ i just wrote heaps in my reply to you and this bastarding machine decided i had done an illegal operation and losed down the program . 
^ illegal my arse . 
^ i was just bloody typing . 
^ &name . 
^ anyway , hiya . 
^ finally got round to writing your postcard so &name is posting it today at work . 
^ &name , cheapness . 
^ that last email ? 
^ i was slightly pissed off and was just venting a bit . 
^ ok , a lot . 
^ but thanks for forwarding it to &name , by the by , cuz now dad 's seen it and i can tell he 's a bit annoyed . 
^ now , midterms . 
^ i 'm guessing i told you about &name - that was a week past friday . 
^ well , i got &num so i was really chuffed until today when the lecturer said the highest mark was &num which was the highest ever for this exam . 
^ so now i 'm pissed off cuz one of the &num &num got wrong - i knew the answer but for some raason managed to write down the wrong one but if i had n't then i would have had &num as well . 
^ i always bloody do this - i 'm never happy with my results . 
^ hmmph. 
^ &name was on saturday but i do n't know how i 've done yet . 
^ not particularly well i do n't think . 
^ this week i have a maths test ( wed ) , a physics " quiz " ( thurs and then my soc assignment due on fri . 
^ which is bad , since i only started it this weekend , but that was cuz i was so busy with other stuff . 
^ oh , and i 'm so annoyed . 
^ was dying to see &name tonight , then reaad in the paper yesterday - postponed due to illness in the band . 
^ &name fuck fuck . 
^ it 's kind of good since i have more time for uni work but i 've got a bad feeling they 'll rearrange it for some time when i ca n't make it . 
^ like when i 'm home at &name . 
^ or when &name goes to &name for uni in the new year and i have no one to go with . 
^ bugger . 
^ but they 're annoouncing the revised date later this week so hopefully it 'll be ok . 
^ i saw the first trailer for &name &name last night so it 's out &name 16th so i 'm guessing that 's around the same time as you . 
^ i will be there the day it opens . 
^ hopefully . 
^ but it certainly will not be shit &name dear . 
^ how dare ye suggest duch a thing . 
^ do n't know when &name of the rings is out.probably when i 'm home fopr &name . 
^ it 's a conspiracy i tell you . 
^ but there 's a &name &name exhibition opening on &name for a couple of weeks in &name so me and &name are maybe going to that . 
^ we need something to pass the time til the " &name . 
^ plus it 's only &num bucks , which is nice . 
^ still no job . 
^ but i 've no time really so i think i 'll get work study and that 's it . 
^ but i 'm annoyed cuz when they granted my work study they took away my bursary , which they did n't tell me they would do . 
^ so now i get $ &num ( if i do all the time i 'm allowed ) instead of $ &num . 
^ bastards . 
^ but never mind . 
^ &name &name . 
^ think i 'll go and make a cheese toastie . 
^ i 've just rediscovered tehm and mmmmmmmm , they 're good . 
^ &name luv , &name xx
