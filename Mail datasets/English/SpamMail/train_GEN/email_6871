^ dear &name , 
^ why do you think we need another reminder to the players ? 
^ i 'll send one a couple of days before thursday , of course ( is that what you meant ? ) about the bowing . ... as i said i 'm not free until after saturday ... but after that i could squeeze something in. have you got the parts , &name it would be good if i could look at &num a.s.a.p. to see how much is to be done . 
^ i will of course need a list of which bits we 're doing ! 
^ it would n't be a disaster if we did n't bow the parts before thursday , though . 
^ most of it will be common sense for the players . 
^ by the way , who 's the publicity person , again ? 
^ i 'd really like some posters to put up in the colony . 
^ &name all is well with you , 
^ &name bless , 
^ &name
