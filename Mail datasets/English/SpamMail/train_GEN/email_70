^ all but one of the answer files are now in /usr / groups / mphil / qa03 / rmrs / ans - the missing &num files are &num , &num , &num and &num . 
^ if we can repair the problems we will add those files and let you know . 
^ otherwise these are the final versions for this practical ( unless very serious bugs are reported ) . 
^ you may notice that the dates have changed on some of the files that you had before - these files should be otherwise identical to the versions you have been looking at . 
^ although the old &name and &name files remain , please use the top_docs files instead . 
^ i have replaced ques-out-jan29.rmrs with a version which has &num structure for each of the &num sentences ( the older version had &num structures missing ) . 
^ there should be a &num mapping between the sentences in this file and the answer files , apart from the missing answer files mentioned above . 
^ please let me know at once if you suspect that this is still not the case . 
^ i will attempt to answer all the outstanding questions that you have sent tonight or on sunday if not . 
^ thanks for your patience ,
