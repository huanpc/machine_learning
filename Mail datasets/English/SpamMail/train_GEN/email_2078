^ now , before continuing on towards the main body of this epistle , i would humbly and fervently beg of you to please use  um spaces between your sentences . ^ this one-space-hooliganism is driving my sentence-construction-neurosis to distraction . ^ thank you , o grammatical princess . ^ (  ame ) furthermore , i am totally fed up of going through e-mails and ensuring all the sentences are double spaced . ^ it is becoming tiresome , as  ame appears to have the same disease as you . ^  ame does not , but then she is an english student . ^ so , yes , i have only heard from  ame and  ame since you e-mailed last . ^  ame , as you knew , was judging that christian schools conference , and  ame seems to be looking for work . ^ other than that , she writes highly amusing emails about cookery ^  ame 's comments on flat cooking to  ame ; glad to hear about your cooking ; now there 's  um of us who can cook ( do n't trust  ame and  ame 's cooking , do n't trust  ame 's methods of cooking , tend to be of the " what 's this ? ^ how interesting ! ^ i 'll put that in , then " variety ) . ^ i thought that was highly amusing , as you might have guessed . ^  ame sent me these questions via e-mail , which i answered as follows ; ^  um ) how many sheep are there in your house ? ^ * none . ^ animals are nor welcome in my abode , even sheep . ^  um ) how many sheep are there in your garden ? ^ * once again , none , usually . ^ you see , since our garden is literally a ploughed field ( tractor and plough came last week ) there is no motivation for sheep to grace it with their presence . ^ oh well , we shall soon plant a nice lawn for them . ^  um ) how many sheep are there in your village ? ^ *  um do not live in a village . ^ i live in the country . ^ i.e. no nasty unhygienic people in close proximity abiding . ^ i live surrounded by fields , some of which contain sheep ,  um , grass , and other natural produce of the scottish borders agricultural system . ^ i have never taken the time to count the sheep , just the  um , and therefore  um cannot give you an exact figure . ^  ame . ^ will this ruin your life for good ? ^  um ) how many sheep are there in your county ? ^ * check the internet . ^ i would n't like to hazard a guess . ^ i might be gloriously and utterly wrong . ^  um ) how many sheep are there in  ame ? ^ * multiply the population of  ame by the number of people in  ame divided by the number of daffodils in  ame . ^ the sheep , as well put by a young foreign guest of our family last summer is , after all , the national hero . ^ there is a statue of him in a quaint southern scottish town that 's what prompted this epitaph . ^ now ,  ame . ^ well , i 'm glad you thought tales of  ame version  um was funny . ^ i did . ^ however , i 'm quite stunned to hear of poor lost bewildered frightened angry annoyed cross little  ame searching for me somewhere in  ame . ^ i was so sure it was him i saw the other day , diligently pecking in my newly ploughed garden . ^ oh dear . ^ i may have been mistaken . ^ yes , i agree , i 'd better inform  ame immediately , this is becoming serious ! ^  har raven 's emotional balance is at stake ! ^ anyway , my return from university with a water pistol has prompted my younger brother ,  ame , to purchase a  ame  um , like  ame 's, so we are no longer safe even at home . ^ following that , our neighbour 's son bought a  ame  um , like  ame 's, so the entire area is in a continual state of unrest . ^ there have been rumours of a police state being declared , with the  ame conglomerate as the dictatorial government , but i do n't believe that . ^ you may be interested to know that i have bought a mission praise music edition , and am thoroughly enjoying practising the songs in it . ^ ( not that i 'm any good at them ! ) at church this morning we had someone called  ame  ame preaching obviously not your dad , but funny that he has the same name . ^ hope you are feeling well . ^ i 'm looking forward to the return of  ame  ame on television next week . ^  ame has asked me to record them so we can all watch them in the flat next year . ^ well , considering the following thoughts of  ame 's on  ame  ame , i do n't know if all will go as planned ^  ame says  ame refuses to be subject to conversations on the subjects of : work  ame  ame quality of food quantity of food boys  ame  ame tv scheduling for the next few hours of that day  ame 's mess  ame 's fussiness  ame  ame ^ i am going to be a leader at a scripture  ame camp in a week 's time . ^ yesterday morning i discovered that someone from  ame 's is going on the very same camp ! ^ not only that , but she was in my bible study group last year ! ^ amazing ! ^ the weather here is abysmal rain at  um degrees ,  um degrees and  um degrees . ^ that 's the inclination of the droplets not the temperature . ^ writing of temperature , i 'm noticing how chilly it is up here compared to  ame . ^ (  ame ! ^ he admits feeling cold ! ^ call an ambulance ! ) totally out of the blue , do n't you think  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame is simply delirious ? ^ pure and utter joy perhaps even eclipsing water ! ^  ame [ o] [ in] [ whatever really ! ] ^ (  ame ,  ame ,  ame ! ^ fill this land with the father 's glory ! ) ^  um words (  ame ! ) ^  ame no , i have not yet attempted to use the washing machine . ^ cooking and baking are my starting points . ^ also , have you been checking that these e-mails are exactly  um words long ? ^ please do . ^ it 's an uncanny innate ability i seem to possess . ^ sometimes i wonder just how wonderful  um person can be . </text_normal></message_body></message>
