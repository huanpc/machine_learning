^ programme-- if &name &name is going in a non-alphabetical list of acknowledgements , do you not think he should come first before &name &name ? ! ! 
^ also . . ... you are in fact putting the list in order of importance , are n't you ? 
^ just wondering if maybe it might be better to do it alphabetically to avoid offending anyone ? 
^ or am i just being overly cautious ?
