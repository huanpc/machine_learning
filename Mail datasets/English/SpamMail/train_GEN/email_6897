^ hi there , 
^ i 've been thinking about adding a built-in icon replacement feature to &name setup &num . 
^ originally i wanted to use the native &name functions , but i ca n't seem to get them to work right . 
^ i 've tried your icon replacer program and it appears to work quite nicely , and has the added bonus of working on win9x too . 
^ &website in &name setup &num . 
^ of course , you would be given full credit for the feature in the sources and help file . 
^ thanks , &name &name
