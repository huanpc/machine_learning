^ dear &name , 
^ i would like to bring a few items to your notice . 
^ please observe deadlines where appropriate . 
^ graduate request for cloth napkins &name &name asked me on behalf of some graduates to inquire if it is possible to replace the paper napkins utilized at formal dinners by cloth &num , perhaps with the colleges . 
^ coat of arms being embroidered on them . 
^ i contacted the &name &name &name &name , the &num and only green officer at &website ) on the undergradutes.s position . 
^ they questioned whether cloth napkins may create greater environmental damage than paper &num due to the requirement for soap , ironing etc , and as a result did not reach a definite position but suggested to take it to college council . 
^ however , before such a suggestion can be brought to college council , further consultations with college staff have to be made . 
^ &name , the new &name &name officer , who takes over from me , shall be contacted with any concern in this matter . 
^ &name the flagpole on top of the gate tower is currently out of order . 
^ the hazards for the health of the porters , who are obliged to hoist the flag , were too great . 
^ the building committee decided over several meetings in consultation with college council to replace the flagpole at the same location after having dismissed other solutions . 
^ the costs are estimated to be in the region of &pound; 317k-20k . 
^ at the moment the flagpole is secured so that no safety hazard is posed to the student community and college staff . 
^ provision for &name &name . 
^ students by college college council was made familiar with a report by a university committee about the provision for &name &name . 
^ students ( and related one-year postgraduate degrees ) . 
^ the report can be obtained from dr mc &name by calling his secretary under &num . 
^ the senior tutor dr &name and the graduate tutor dr &name wrote a response to council , with following comments : 
^ &num ) it is suggested that the college supports the remission of fees in the fourth year if a &name &name students registers for a phd degree in retrospect , has the first year ( the &name ) counted as the first year of the phd and continues into the fourth year . 
^ the support for this arises due to the lack of eligibily to accommodation or research expenses support . 
^ ( &name only during first year , research expenses support only during first &num years ) 
^ &num ) the university committee suggests to include &name &name . 
^ students into the research assistance funds schemes if available at a college . 
^ it is recommended that the college acquiesce in this in order that .unscheduled . 
^ research expenses could receive support from such a fund . 
^ &num ) care for &name &name students should be exercised by directors of studies ( who usually care for undergraduates ) at college level . 
^ it is not suggested to support this but leave it to the faculties . 
^ however , dr &name is going to group graduate students and fellows with a close subject together so that &name &name students have somebody to be entertained by and to consult with , if necessary . 
^ &num ) &name &name students shall receive a co-ordinated orientation and reception . 
^ the graduate tutor sees this as developed as it can be . 
^ &name : to &num ) + &num ) the &name committee.s view is to fully support the remission of fees and the establishment of a research expenses fund for &name &name . 
^ students . 
^ however , the strict deadline for research expenses support for ph. &name students to receive assistance only within the first &num years ( last &num months thesis binding and conferences only ) , was regarded as not appropriate since a considerable number of ph. &name students carries on into the fourth year and may then reach a position when to actually be able to spend the money , e.g. having obtained results late and can only then go to a conference ; submitting a thesis late and thus having the cost late too . 
^ the argument college will have is that students may abuse the fund and acquire items not necessarily needed for their research at &name but rather for the time after . 
^ this could be counteracted by limiting the fund to or excluding from it expenses that shall not be defrayed . 
^ we would like to change these regulations and would like to have your opinion 
^ to &num ) + &num ) here are in particular the students of &name &name . 
^ and related programmes asked to air their comments / suggestions on these points . 
^ &website
