^ dear &name , 
^ hello ! 
^ how are you ? 
^ i wo n't ask you if you enjoyed your holiday in &name , but take my word for it - it does have some shops ; they just tend to congregate in cities . 
^ thanks for your postcard - i got it yesterday . 
^ hope you 're enjoying being at home again . 
^ i 'm enjoying living in the flat ; it 's good fun so far . 
^ well , my placement is good . 
^ i 'm doing research on coatings for paint - which is much more interesting than it sounds honestly ! 
^ i say 'doing " , but i have n't really started yet due to &num thing and another . 
^ most of my time so far has been spent reading patents and being inducted . 
^ there are a few other students working there too , so that 's nice . 
^ we were supposed to start doing some experiments today but then it was pointed out we did n't have safety footwear , so that required a little trip out to buy some maybe tomorrow will see some work 
^ wonderfully , i do n't have to get up at 6am every day any more ! 
^ i 've found someone who works there and lives in &name , so he gives me a lift there and back . 
^ sorry i have n't emailed much - internet access has been rather difficult as college is the nearest online place for me and i only manage to check it once or twice a week ! 
^ however , i now have a computer at work so that should make things easier . 
^ my family has been staying with me last week . 
^ they were having a holiday in and around &name . 
^ last sunday &name and his family came to visit for the evening . 
^ we all went out for a meal to &name &name , and &name and i also went to visit &name &name . 
^ &name wanted to try and look around &name &char , but it was locked . 
^ however , &name i was open so we wandered in there and looked around a little - most bizarre ! 
^ we also had a little look in &name &name 
^ &name to hear from you soon and looking forward to seeing you at the beginning of september . 
^ are you happy for me to come down to &name , because you 're quite welcome to come up and visit me this time ? 
^ love &name
