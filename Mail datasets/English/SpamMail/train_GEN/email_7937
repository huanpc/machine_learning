^ &name &name , 
^ i 've meant to e-mail you for some time but just did n't get around to it . 
^ i retire in &num weeks time and am really looking forward to it . 
^ we 've had so many changes over the past &num years that the job just is n't fun anymore . 
^ i had enquired about a package a couple of times this year but nothing happened . 
^ when i got a new boss , the 4th in &num years , he already knew i had asked for a package . 
^ we discussed it and he wanted me to consider training for his job . 
^ i did n't see any point in that as i had planned on retiring at &num if no package was forthcoming . 
^ anyway they came back to me with a few options including salary continuance for &num years with full benefits and at the end of that time i 'd collect a pension ( reduced by &num because i 'm taking it before age &num but that would have happened anyway if i retired at &name . 
^ so i accepted the &num years salary continuance , i could leave when i wanted to and was going to go at the end of september but was talked into staying on at least couple of months . 
^ so i 'm officially leaving on november 30th but am actually leaving on november 16th and using up &num weeks holidays . 
^ i ca n't see any point in staying on any longer now that i have made my mind up and if there was another merger or acquisition someone could renege my deal . 
^ &name has &num quines from &name staying this weekend . 
^ they attend &name &name and are on a year 's exchange . 
^ &num quine is working for &name in &name and the other quine is working for general motors in &name . 
^ both towns fairly close to &name . 
^ they were out on friday night and &name had her false &name confiscated by the bouncer who knew &name , the &num year old girl whose &name she had . 
^ they were out again last night , it 's almost 11am and no one is up yet . 
^ &name seems to be getting on okay and is doing well in her studies but probably spends too much time swoting . 
^ so far she 's surviving okay with &name , they have n't had a fisticuffs yet . 
^ i 'm listening to the &name , &name game on &name radio &name via the &name as i 'm writing this . 
^ not a good idea . 
^ &name are getting hammered . 
^ how are you getting on this term ? 
^ are you still going out with &name ? 
^ when are you going up to the &name for christmas and is &name going with you ?
