^ hi &name ! 
^ your email would be very gratefully received . 
^ i 'm more concerned with genuine email , as i already have a large amount of junk , extracted from an online archive . 
^ the easiest way to donate email is to simply send the back-end 'message folder " files , which include all of the header info . 
^ for example , if you have a folder entitled 'msgs " then it will appear as the file 'msgs " in the " ~/mail / " folder wherever your email is stored ( i.e. in your hermes filespace ) , which can be accessed via ftp or similar . 
^ these files can be fed directly into the anonymiser . 
^ thanks very much for your help &name ,

^ re : e-mail &name &name 
^ i get a fair bit of mail , junk and otherwise which i 'd be happy to donate , if anonymised . 
^ i currently use &name which , since tweaked , seems to do a fairly good job of filtering my mail , but i can always filter it out to you rather than marking it as &name and putting it in the trash . 
^ let me know how you want the mail , whether you want mail forwarded , copied in its raw state ( including all headers ) or whatever . 
^ i do n't know whether you just want my &name account ( which is mainly &name stuff + &name ) or my general account e-mail too ( which includes stuff from outside uni , various ( high-traffic ) mailing lists , occassional random e-mail from someone who used my software which i wrote before coming to uni ( or a complaint from someone who 's been infected by a virus and thinks i gave it to them ) etc. i rarely get any viruses , since &name seems to stop prolific viruses in &name and my external account is scanned in &name , although i do get the empty messages without the worms ( hey , my &name folder is full of e-mails from &email at the moment ! ) . 
^ let me know if & how i can assist anyway
