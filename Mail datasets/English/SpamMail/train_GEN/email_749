^ &name , 
^ nor was it spent in the bath , if that 's what you meant we did not play the same guitar , in case that 's what you were thinking 
^ if you keep writing funny things like those i shall run out of wit . 
^ now , before continuing on towards the main body of this epistle , i would humbly and fervently beg of you to please use &num spaces between your sentences . 
^ this one-space-hooliganism is driving my sentence-construction-neurosis to distraction . 
^ thank you , &char grammatical prince . 
^ ( &name ) 
^ now , do you really think you can put me off answering the questions about sheep ? ! 
^ i 'm just itching to have a go ; 
^ how many sheep are there in your house ? 
^ none . 
^ animals are nor welcome in my abode , even sheep . 
^ how many sheep are there in your garden ? 
^ once again , none , usually . 
^ you see , since our garden is literally a ploughed field ( tractor and plough came last week ) there is no motivation for sheep to grace it with their presence . 
^ oh well , we shall soon plant a nice lawn for them . 
^ how many sheep are there in your village ? 
^ i do not live in a village . 
^ i live in the country . 
^ i.e. no nasty unhygienic people in close proximity abiding . 
^ i live surrounded by fields , some of which contain sheep , &num , grass , and other natural produce of the scottish borders agricultural system . 
^ i have never taken the time to count the sheep , just the &num , and therefore &num cannot give you an exact figure . 
^ &name . 
^ will this ruin your life for good ? 
^ how many sheep are there in your county ? 
^ check the internet . 
^ i would n't like to hazard a guess . 
^ i might be gloriously and utterly wrong . 
^ how many sheep are there in &name ? 
^ multiply the population of &name by the number of people in &name divided by the number of daffodils in &name . 
^ the sheep , as well put by a young foreign guest of our family last summer is , after all , the national hero . 
^ there is a statue of him in a quaint southern scottish town that 's what prompted this epitaph . 
^ i also cooked dinner last night , and very nice it was too . 
^ you 'll be pleased to learn that i have a 'really useful student cook-book " ! 
^ &name , well , good , what do you use it for ? 
^ &name , but &name has been informing me of your cookery skills 
^ &name 's comments on flat cooking to &name ; glad to hear about your cooking ; now there 's one of us who can cook ( do n't trust &name and &name 's cooking , do n't trust &name 's methods of cooking , tend to be of the " what 's this ? 
^ how interesting ! 
^ i 'll put that in , then " variety ) . 
^ i thought that was highly amusing . 
^ now , i am going to be a leader at an scripture &name camp in a weeks time . 
^ this morning i discovered that someone from &name 's is going on the very same camp ! 
^ not only that , but she was in my bible study group last year ! 
^ it 's &name . 
^ is n't that amazing ? ! 
^ well , this morning i 've been filling holes in wood with wood filler , while listening to shine , &name , &name . 
^ &char lovely monotonous job . 
^ this afternoon i went on a trip to a garden centre , after which i returned to prepare dinner . 
^ i made something with chicken this evening ( for the meal ) . 
^ incidentally , have you heard from &name by email at all ? 
^ &name could n't understand why he did n't reply to her . 
^ i do n't think she knew it was his dad 's e-mail address she was sending to . 
^ totally out of the blue , do n't you think &name &name &name &name &name &name is simply delirious ? 
^ i 'm listening to it at this moment in time . 
^ &name and utter joy perhaps even eclipsing water ! 
^ well , since i 've started talking of water again , i shall stop . 
^ it is my self-regulating signal that i have nothing of any further interest to say . 
^ so , adieu , for this evening . 
^ &name [ o] [ in] [ whatever really ! ] 
^ ( &name , &name , &name ! 
^ fill this land with the father 's glory ! )
