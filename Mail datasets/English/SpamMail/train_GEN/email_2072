" . ^ oh dear ! ^ well , i just laughed my head off at the thought of dad being on a similar level to you and  ame ! ^ i may soon have some interesting tales to tell of  ame and her friends . ^ however , i can assure you that she is not a goodie . ^ she is a pest if ever there was one - sent by someone to annoy the life out of the  ame family . ^ i hate pigeons . ^ well , i 'd better go now . ^ hope you have a fun weekend . ^ bye for now ,  ame ^  ame : a recent post script from my sister  ame ( after i told her of your soon-to-be revelations about your holiday with  ame ) . ^ i quote : " ) ps -  ame is a complete total and utter nutter ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ^ : ) " ^ get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
