^ &name precious people ! ! 
^ hope you have all had a wonderful week of festivities , birthday celebrations ( &name ! ) , snowboarding ( &name ! ) , and other fun stuff . 
^ i 've had a great time with my family , and &name and &name , who were down for christmas - it was so lovely to see them again . 
^ yesterday i ventured into the wild north country and went to good old &name with &name and my mam . 
^ and , yes , you 've guessed it , i went and visited good old ( &name ... young ! ) &name in hospital - and got to see busy-bee &name too as she arrived at the hospital shortly after i did . 
^ so , we had a &name reunion in the antiquarian hospital ( it is really old fashioned ! ) , which was really nice , and i think &name was cheered by the whole thing . 
^ he was still in some pain , but not as much as he had been , and if you did n't think he was thin enough to start with ... well , he 's even thinner now . 
^ worrying . 
^ however , he 's making rapid progress since the operation , and will be allowed to go home today at some point , so he was well excited by the prospect of his release . 
^ well , i hope you all have a fab new year a &name 's! ! 
^ sadly , i ca n't come and join you all - what with &num thing and another and extortionately expensive train fares , i 'm afraid i 've had to give up the idea . 
^ i shall no doubt still have an enjoyable new year - i 'm going with my family to the lake district to visit friends and have a mini-holiday with them . 
^ i 'm quite looking forward to it . 
^ it 's snowing ! ! 
^ our garden looks like it 's been dusted with icing sugar . 
^ &name , better go . 
^ have fun people ! 
^ see you / speak to you soon , muchus love , &name xxx 
^ ps - i saw a shooting star last night . 
^ why you 'd want to know that , i 'm really not sure , but i though it was cool ! ! 
^ get your free download of &name explorer at &website .
