^ hello peeps ! 
^ &name and i thought we 'd try sending out the passage for the coming week 's bible study , so that you can read it in advance and come to the bible study ready to discuss it . 
^ so , here it is . ... 
^ &name &num ( a brilliant chapter ! 
^ and it picks up on what was preached at &name tonight , as well ! 
^ &smiley 
^ freedom in &name 
^ 1it is for freedom that &name has set us free . 
^ stand firm , then , and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery . 
^ 2mark my words ! 
^ &char , &name , tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised , &name will be of no value to you at all . 
^ 3again i declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law . 
^ &name who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from &name ; you have fallen away from grace . 
^ 5but by faith we eagerly await through the &name the righteousness for which we hope . 
^ 6for in &name &name neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value . 
^ the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love . 
^ 7you were running a good race . 
^ who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth ? 
^ 8that kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you . 
^ 9' &char little yeast works through the whole batch of dough . " &num am confident in the &name that you will take no other view . 
^ the one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty , whoever he may be . 
^ 11brothers , if i am still preaching circumcision , why am i still being persecuted ? 
^ in that case the offense of the cross has been abolished . 
^ 12as for those agitators , i wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves ! 
^ 13you , my brothers , were called to be free . 
^ but do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature [ &num ] ; rather , serve one another in love . 
^ &name entire law is summed up in a single command : " love your neighbour as yourself .' [ &num ] &name you keep on biting and devouring each other , watch out or you will be destroyed by each other . 
^ life by the &name 
^ &name i say , live by the &name , and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature . 
^ 17for the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the &name , and the &name what is contrary to the sinful nature . 
^ they are in conflict with each other , so that you do not do what you want . 
^ 18but if you are led by the &name , you are not under law . 
^ 19the acts of the sinful nature are obvious : sexual immorality , impurity and debauchery ; 20idolatry and witchcraft ; hatred , discord , jealousy , fits of rage , selfish ambition , dissensions , factions 21and envy ; drunkenness , orgies , and the like . 
^ i warn you , as i did before , that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of &name . 
^ 22but the fruit of the &name is love , &name , &name , &name , kindness , goodness , faithfulness , 23gentleness and self-control . 
^ against such things there is no law . 
^ 24those who belong to &name &name have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires . 
^ 25since we live by the &name , let us keep in step with the &name . 
^ 26let us not become conceited , provoking and envying each other . 
^ footnotes 
^ 5: &num or the flesh ; also in verses &num , &num , &num and &num 
^ 5: &num &name . 
^ &num : &num 
^ &name the version is &name , if you want to know . 
^ &name
