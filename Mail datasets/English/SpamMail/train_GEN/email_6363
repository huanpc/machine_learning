^ hey admittedly i still have n't used your updated version of &name replacer , because it requires &name &name and i wo n't be using that until it 's officially released . 
^ ( which will hopefully happen before i 'm dead and gone &smiley i did want to let you know that the older version is renaming the &website " --- ) 'dvdx &website " notice the &char becomes lowercase . 
^ i just thought i 'd mention it so you could make sure that this bug does n't also exist in your newer version . 
^ thanks , christian &name
