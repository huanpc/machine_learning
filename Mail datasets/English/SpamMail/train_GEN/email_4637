^ btw - i forgot the thing i was going to ask you about ! 
^ i would like to know what you could think of ( how you could ) building a heirarchy among automatically generated classes . 
^ can you remember in the heirarchical system we have flight , toplace , &name , city etc. they have classified flight over &name over city but i wonder how the heirarchy is formed without hand coding it . 
^ say if i have &num automatically generated classes - would the prudent thing to do be to look at the classes that contain linguistically identifiable word groups and then map to a hierarchy ( are there any available ? ) or just look for dominance and subsets etc where in a class subsumes most of another class . 
^ any ideas ? 
^ - no need to trouble yourself if you are busy 
^ catch you later , &name .
