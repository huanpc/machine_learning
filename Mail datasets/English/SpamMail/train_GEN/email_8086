^ after much deliberation here 's what i think is the best bet . 
^ going to the maldives for &num nights , staying on &name island - &website &name ( week or &num earlier would be preferable but it clashes with &name 's wedding) . 
^ there 's no single supplement in may so no one has to share either . 
^ cost for flights and resort ( b&b) is &pound; &num ( special offer ) then add &pound; &num for booze and food . 
^ approx cost for diving , including guides , equipment , etc. , for each of us is : 
^ &name - open water course ( &num days ) - &num pool dives , &num water dives - &pound; &num . 
^ &name - &name course ( &num day ) - &num pool , &num water ; &num water dives ( &num days ) 
^ - &pound; &num . 
^ &name - advanced open water ( &num days ) - &num water ; &num water dives ( &num days ) &pound; &num . 
^ depending on the flight times , we could well get a sixth day which will be &num water dives for &pound; &num . 
^ &name , you might be able to do likewise on the fifth day if your &name goes okay . 
^ any problems / suggestions ? 
^ i 'll send it around &name later ( after the bonus announcements &smiley to see if anyone else is tempted .
