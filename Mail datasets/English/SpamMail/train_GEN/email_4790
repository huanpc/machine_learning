^ congrats on the show selling out - does that mean that &name made some money or were there too many comp tickets ? 
^ did &name and &name come ? 
^ did &name get a comp ticket ? 
^ of course ... the weather has to get nice as soon as i leave &smiley 
^ the hitchhiking was n't as impressive as it sounds . 
^ i did n't exactly stand on the side of the road with my thumb out ... i just asked a nice couple as they were getting into their car &smiley 
^ i sent in my film to get developed but i 'm convinced that it will be the most boring roll of film in history . 
^ most of the pictures were taken half-heartedly &smiley 
^ the weather is amazing here - if you come to &name i am definitely taking you for a punt . 
^ hope you made it back ok .
