^ &name , 
^ in case anyone is interested , a few of us from &name / the speak network now have definite plans to meet up next week to read about justice and study the &name and talk together . 
^ from : thursday 11th - wednesday 17th july . 
^ in &name , &name &name - between &name and &name . 
^ also if anyone wants to join us just on thursday evening to hear &name &name speak in &name on 'making a difference " then let me know - especially if a bed for the night would help . 
^ and if you want to join us for part of the time , let me know &name it may well be possible ! 
^ the group so far is : &name , ( &name ? ) &name &name , &name &name 's &name &name , &name &name &name , &name &name &name , &name me 
^ and possibly &name &name from &name / &name &name from &name . 
^ details follow if you 're interested in coming - they 'll be very boring otherwise , so stop reading now ! 
^ love , &name xxx 
^ details 
^ start : &name 11th july going to an evening with &name &name ( and &name &name + &name &name ) called " you can make a difference " - i thought that should set us up nicely ! 
^ our program will begin on the friday . 
^ and finish on wednesday 17th july p.m. 
^ travel you need to get to &name railway station in the midlands . 
^ then ill either get you a lift to the house or tell you what bus to get . 
^ &name very near the station i think . 
^ ( you could also get a bus from &name to the house , or a bus straight to &name 's thing from solihull or &name international / airport or &name coach station . ) 
^ arrival &name &name is at &num : &num on the thursday - arriving &name between &num : &num i can probably arrange lifts ... you are welcome to come any time on the thursday , just let me know . ... we can have tea before we go if people are there soon enough ... 
^ phone me if you want to know the best way to get there . ... 
^ saturday 13th there 's " the call " in &name that day - do we all want to go to it and fit it into the programme ? 
^ this seems a nice suggestion to me , but its up to you all and &char also do n't know if here are tickets left ! 
^ it 's handy from &name . 
^ study we 're suggesting a mixture of &name study together , reading christian books then sharing answers to questions we 've highlighted to look at , and maybe all read one particular book about justice theology and di9scuss it . ... any suggestions as to what book ? ? 
^ or what bible studies ? 
^ eg could go thru &name or some of &name for &name studies ... 
^ &name can you let me know whether you have any good board / party game to bring ? 
^ i have a &name trivia game ! ! 
^ and we might go swimming &num day so bring a costume if you can ! 
^ food 
^ we thought if we all thought of a meal idea for dinner that 'd be cool . 
^ lunch could be a bit more snacky / sandwichy ... &name is good , complicated is ok if you want ! ! 
^ preferably all veggie , &name &num menus is rather a hassle - any objections ? ? 
^ we can buy ingredients and all chip in when we arrive if we know what meals we are all planning . 
^ you do n't neccessarily have to cook your meal , and if you have no good ideas , say so rather than subject us to yuckiness ! 
^ if we could all make a cake or biscuits and bring them , that 'd be cool . 
^ again , do n't worry if you ca n't! 
^ sleeping there are some beds which we can maybe take turns if there are n't enough ! 
^ so you only really need sheets / duvet cover / pillow case / &name . 
^ if you have a fave / compact sleeping bag &num or &num might be handy ! 
^ to bring obvious clothes and stuff . ... 
^ we have access to a washing machine and general housey things if we want . 
^ &name ! 
^ notebooks &name we will learn so much ! 
^ cake if poss a recipe 
^ and 
^ - any books you have about justice , or bible studies which cover relevant issues , which we might want to do together or which anyone might like to read ! ! ! 
^ music does anyone play a guitar / other instrument and / or have a gift for leading worship ? 
^ contact me ! 
^ please confirm whether you want me to get you tickets for &name &name and / or the call .
