^ thanks for the advice . 
^ that 's interesting that industry cares more about pedigree than academic places . 
^ i wonder if it 's because the faculty interview process is more thorough ... or perhaps it 's because people people in academia understand more that the differences between the top schools are n't that great . 
^ by the way : i heard from &name today . 
^ i did n't get the fellowship , but at least i got honorable mention this year . 
^ so that leaves the &name as the only thing left to hear back from . 
^ &name all is well , &name 
^ ps . 
^ for some reason , our work together was chosen as the example of the research opportunites &name gives its students in a report from the &num major research universities in &name claiming they bring ecomonic benefit to the area and assumedly derserve some kind of tax break . 
^ if you 're interested , there 's a couple sentences about us on page &num of part &num : the universities as &name : education , research and business development which can be found at &website worth your time &smiley

^ another way to look at it is that if you excel at &name or &org , you will be in a better position than if you excel at &name . 
^ i guess you have to ask yourself where you will excel . 
^ i do n't know how to answer your question . 
^ some industry places seemed to care about my pedigree , but i do n't know about academic places . 
^ i got offers from all of the academic places i interviewed except for one , so obviously they were n't concerned about my going to &name . 
^ on the other hand , maybe i would have gotten more interviews from top-calibre schools coming from somewhere else - who knows ?

^ hi professor &name , 
^ just got back from &name - talked to christian , &name , &name , and &name . 
^ anyway , &name and &name brought up the point that &num advantage of going to &name over an &org or &name would be that it would be easier to differentiate oneself from the other students to get a good recommendation , should i want to apply for faculty positions after i graduate . 
^ i had n't thought of this , and was wondering what you thought , given that you went through the application process recently after graduating &name . 
^ do you think you would have done better if you went to a school with a bigger name , or did being one of the best students at &name help you ? 
^ sorry to bother you ... there 's no rush to answer this question . 
^ either way , &name and &name convinced me that &name should still remain in consideration . 
^ anyway , it was nice to see you today and catch up .
