^ well , this is really to avoid confusion . 
^ &name has nothing to do with this , the booking of &name was done last year by someone who is not even in a basketball team anymore . 
^ apparently , the booking was made and no one else was informed , so literally no one knew anything before the beginning of this week when i got the &name invoice . 
^ i called to &name already and they do n't have any regular slot free ( they have random hours even more weird than those in the invoice ) . 
^ the timetable might have changed on the base of complaints / non-avaibility of the court , honestly , i have no clue ...
