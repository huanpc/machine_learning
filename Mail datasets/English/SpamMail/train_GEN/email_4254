^ guys just a quick note . 
^ to all those that are n't at the dinner on monday evening , there will probably be a piss around mixed game on wednesday with the ladies &num , just to have a run around and get away from the books . 
^ anyone can turn up . 
^ it would be good to see most of you there , but if you ca n't make it for some reason let me know . 
^ then we will have a few beers in the evening . 
^ cover any fines . 
^ those not there may have a slight leverage to their final fines total , so its an incentive to be at the pub wednesday evening . 
^ after all we have &num weeks worth to pay . 
^ could be costly . 
^ see you boys wednesday hopefully . 
^ the fury . 
^ &name &char drinking shirts will be done for next term . 
^ there has been a slight delay and they will be ready for then . 
^ anyone who wants to complain has to fight the carcas . 
^ bring it on . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ add photos to your e-mail with &name &num . 
^ get &num months free * .
