^ it 's true ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ reports are coming in of sightings of a lifeless raven , lying below a tree somewhere in &name . 
^ it seems the raven in question was attempting some form of strange and twisted communication ritual involving bizarre movements of the head . 
^ the word on the street is that this supposed raven could actually be the one known only as &name , an intergalactic ambassador from the &char &name . 
^ we now turn to our reporter on the scene . ... 
^ so , exactly how many reports have we had in. 
^ reporter : well ... actually not that many . 
^ how many ? 
^ reporter : well ... ummm ... not very many at all really . 
^ how many ? ? ? ? 
^ reporter : well , actually just the one . 
^ just the one ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ! ! ! 
^ who from . 
^ reporter : the eye-witness was &num &name &name , who appeared to be quite flustered and claimed she had seen the " raven " lying below the tree . 
^ she also muttered something about being sick and tired of searching for &num . 
^ we do not believe this had anything to do with her story however . 
^ folks ! ! ! ! ! 
^ i am hearing some breaking news . ... what ? ? ? . . ... surely not ! ! ! ! ! . ... folks , i have just heard from reliable sources that the whole story is a hoax - set up by some poor disillusioned girl from &name who lost it somewhere during the search for this remarkable bird . 
^ the name " &name " has been banded about in relation to the &name incident , and some say that the aforementioned persona has had contact with the raven since the reported 'death " of &name . 
^ &num lives on ! ! ! ! ! !
