^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- title : flaw in &name &name &name classes could allow code &name ( q329077 ) released : &num september &num &name : versions of the &name virtual machine ( &name &name ) &name : &num vulnerabilities , the most serious of which could enable an attacker to gain complete control over a user 's system . 
^ &name &name : critical bulletin : ms02-052 
^ &name encourages customers to review the security bulletin at : &website . 
^ - ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
^ &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d the &name &name is a virtual machine for the win32 ( &char ) operating environment . 
^ the &name &name shipped as part of most versions of windows ( a complete list is available in the &name ) , as well as part of most versions of &name explorer . 
^ it also was available for some timeas a separate download . 
^ &char new patch for the &name &name is available , which eliminates &num security vulnerabilities . 
^ the attack vectors forall of them would likely be the same . 
^ an attacker would likely create a web page that , when opened , exploits the desired vulnerability , and either host it on a web page or send it to a user as an &name mail . 
^ the first vulnerability involves the &name &name &name ( &name ) classes , which provide features that allow &name applications to connect to and use data from a wide variety of data sources , ranging from flat files to &name &name databases . 
^ the vulnerability results because of a flaw in the way the classes vet a request to load and execute a &name on the user 's system . 
^ although the classes do perform checks that are designed to ensure that only authorized applets can levy such a request , it 's possible to spoof this check by malforming the request in a particular way , thereby enable an attacker to load and execute any &name on the user 's system . 
^ the second vulnerability also involves the &name classes , and results because certain functions in the classes do n't correctly validate handles that are provided as input . 
^ &num straightforward use of this flaw would involve supplying invalid data in lieu of an actual handle when calling such a function , &name has confirmed that this scenario would cause &name explorer to fail . 
^ in addition , there is at least a theoretical possibility that the flaw also could enable an attacker to provide data that would have the effect of running code in the security context of the user . 
^ the third vulnerability involves a class that provides support for the use of &name by &name applications . 
^ this class exposes a number of methods ; some of these are suitable for use by any applet , while othersare only suitable for use by trusted &num . 
^ however , the class does not differentiate correctly between these cases , and instead makes all of the methods available to all applets . 
^ among the functions that could be misused through this vulnerability are &num that would enable an applet to take virtually any desired action on the user 's system . 
^ mitigating factors : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d 
^ - - in order to exploit any of these vulnerabilities via the web- based attack vector , the attacker would need to entice a user into visiting a web site that the attacker controlled . 
^ the vulnerabilities themselves provide no way to force a user to a web site . 
^ - - &name applets are disabled within the restricted sites zone . 
^ as a result , any mail client that opened &name mail within the restricted sites zone , such as &name &num , &name &name &num , or outlook &num or &num when used in conjunction with the outlook email &name &name , would not be at risk from the mail-based attack vector . 
^ - - the vulnerability would gain only the privileges of the user , so customers who operate with less than administrative privileges would be at less risk from the vulnerability . 
^ - - corporate it administrators could limit the risk posed to their users by using application filters at the firewall to inspect and block mobile code . 
^ maximum risk &name : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d 
^ - &name systems : moderate 
^ - &name systems : moderate 
^ - client systems : critical 
^ &name availability : 3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d3d 
^ - a patch is available to fix this vulnerability . 
^ please read the security bulletin at &website for information on obtaining this patch .
