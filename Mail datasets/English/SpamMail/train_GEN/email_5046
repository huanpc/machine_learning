^ noon on friday is the last possible time for it to get here , because &name is leaving then . 
^ he wo n't be back at &name until the 17th and ca n't be reached by fax between leaving here and getting back there . 
^ actually , noon would mean i do n't have time to look at it , so i guess that 11am on friday would be the last reasonable time . 
^ is this doable ? 
^ &name - did you keep a copy ? 
^ if so , could you fax it here ? 
^ that way , i get a chance to look at it in less of a rush .
