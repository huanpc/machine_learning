^ i found the cheque i got today from &name was for rather more than i personally actually paid ( i was expecting &pound; &num ) and thus i suspect that i actually owe various people money . 
^ however , i 'm not sure what i have been given money for . 
^ i have a cheque for &pound; &num , which i guess covers some subset of : 
^ speaker book token : &pound; &num - &name &name + &name ( admin ) : &pound; &num - &name &name gifts ( cond & male soloists ) : &pound; &num - &name extra programmes : &pound; &num - &name 
^ &name 's costs : printing costs &num acetates &num stationary / stamps &num photographic &num + &num &num &num &name &num total &num 
^ my admin : printing costs : &pound; &num card for tickets : &pound; &num steward badges : &pound; &num ribbon for wine : 59p 
^ - - total &pound; &num 
^ musicians from &name &pound; &num &char &num &num &pound; &num 
^ it would seem to equal &name 's costs + &name musicians + 40p ... i ca n't really proper sense of it from the numbers above . 
^ perhaps you could ( with &name 's help ) clarify , so i know who i now owe money to ? 
^ many thanks , 
^ love &name &name &name &name college , &name &name &name &name &name : room &name , &name &name &name &name : &email &name : # &num | &name : &email | &name !
