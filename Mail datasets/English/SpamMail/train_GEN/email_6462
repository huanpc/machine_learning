^ while &char agree that the naming issue is not a large issue , nor even really related to usability at all , &char responded because i do n't believe that telling people to basically shut up is the best way to foster a community , nor is ignoring those who put an effort out there very helpful either . 
^ there is so much criticism out there right now about how &name developers do n't care about users or feedback they receive . 
^ this viewpoint is largely fostered , &name , by " rtfm' -like responses , or simply no response whatsoever . 
^ and seeing as there already were responses and discussion , i thought it &char ay be useful to offer positive insight into the matter rather than to just tell everyone to shut up . 
^ i did manage to to work in a few hints that it really was n't a usability issue along the way . 
^ i hope that helps you understand why &char replied . 
^ &name , &char apologise for that , it was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction on my part , 
^ having read all the arguments and responses last time it came up ( although i dont think it was on this ml ) . 
^ anyway , there are better people to handle the issue than me , so i 'll stay &char ut of it from here . 
^ & for my &name , i agree pretty much with your 'safe namespace " paragraph . 
^ btw , ( and to steer this somewhere useful ) : were n't you working on a usability report on the printer manager ? 
^ if so , did you manage to post it somewhere ? 
^ i do n't seem to have it in my little collection of reports &num ) i looked at it a while back , but lack of time etc etc. . 
^ i have exams till &char he 11th june , hopefully things will improve then .
