^ dear fantastic &name , 
^ sorry this is a bit last minute , so you might not all get it before you come to link meetings , or have time to think about it , but here 's some questions that it would be helpful for you to chew on if you have a minute ... 
^ please note - do not be alarmed , i 'm not asking you to reply to all these questions ! 
^ its just the basis of what we 'll discuss in the meetings , so you can be thinking in advance ! 
^ ( though if you do want to email thoughts back to me you 'd be more than welcome and i 'd love to hear from you ! 
^ - will also make a helpful line of communication if you ca n't make any of the meetings ) 
^ - general first question - how is stuff going as an intrep - any news or anything specific to share ? 
^ - any thoughts on how we can be using the main event " witness &num " as a resource in evangelism among international student friends ? 
^ - &name houseparty - there 's going to be an evening of international prayer , and it would be good to spend some time praying for international stuff in colleges . 
^ do you have any suggestions of things we could say about &name and things we could praise &name for and pray for - general points and also anything specific to your college ? 
^ - &name - how many termcards would you like next term for distributing to international students in your college ? 
^ - intbreks - any feedback ? 
^ - general last question - &num terms have gone , we 've got &num left . 
^ as we look to next term , are there any things you want to change , or particularly concentrate on , as you seek to encourage your college group in reaching out to international students , and in supporting evangelism worldwide ? 
^ great , thanks for reading , looking forward to seeing you this week ! 
^ love &name xxx
