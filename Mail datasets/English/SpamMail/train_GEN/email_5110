^ dear &name , i do n't have a database with the information about universities of first degrees . 
^ there is , however , a slightly out-of-date guide you are welcome to borrow which gives details about all computer science , &name and it courses throughout &name and &name &name . 
^ that may be a good start for establishing a database for advertising purposes . 
^ &name &name tells me that the &name reference library has held a large volume from &name which listed all the institutions from around the world . 
^ i will investigate this further as sadly &name 's web site does not appear to have such useful information , and has locked me out of a number of search facilities . 
^ it would be nice to think that somewhere all of this is stored on &name &name . 
^ thanks , &name 
^ do you happen to know whether we have any sort of list of addresses for computer science departments worldwide ? 
^ perhaps addresses of places which &name students have come from , or something like that ? 
^ the reason i 'm asking is that we need to advertise the &name course as widely as possible . 
^ the staff 
^ in engineering take care of sending out posters etc - i think they generally only send information to &name places but we also need to attract overseas students and i 'm not sure that they have a suitable mailing list to do that . 
^ best ,
