^ &name &name , 
^ the letter has not arrived , and i am leaving today ( &name ) . 
^ if it is very important , the only thing i can think of is to get college to identify the letter and forward it to me at home , and then i can try and get it to a bank from there . 
^ the only problem is that the banks are all closed for quite a bit of time around christmas , so i 'm not sure i 'll be able to get it done before the 26th or so . 
^ let me know what you want to do ,
