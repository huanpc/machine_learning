^ now the standard policy is not to award a &name &num &name certificate to a player who is already a foreign &num &name . 
^ i believe that the reason for this policy is a scenario like : japanese &num &name comes to the &name , gets told " &name grades are a bit tougher than japanese grades , you had better play at &num &name " , and does so . 
^ later they justify their &num &name grade , however it would not be appropriate to give them a &name &num &name certificate . 
^ however , i do n't think that this applies here . 
^ i see no reason not to award &name &name a &num &name certificate , if he earns it . 
^ so , i propose that council makes an exception , and asks &name to track &name &name 's promotion points as if from &num &name to &num &name , then recommend a promotion if it becomes justified .

^ well , i knew i had seen this policy somewhere before , and now i have found it . 
^ it is in the second paragraph at the top of ( &website minor edits ) that text was on the page when i took over maintenance about &num years ago , and i always assumed that it was a long-standing policy . 
^ i am quite happy to change it , but it probably is a change , so do we need to discuss it ?

^ &name the grading committee should consider anyone who satisfies the criteria : 
^ &num ) is a &name member 
^ &num ) plays in tournaments that the grading committee is able to calibrate , i.e. british tournaments and others like the european congresses . 
^ but we must take care to avoid : 
^ &char ) giving certificates which merely acknowledge foreign grades that may not truly correspond to british &num ( or letting ourselves come under pressure to do so ) 
^ &char ) causing offence by giving lower certificates to people who already have higher &num from elsewhere . 
^ nationality does n't really affect it . 
^ we 'd apply exactly the same criteria to a &name returning from overseas , or starting to enter tournaments after getting strong through internet play , would n't we ? 
^ so i think go ahead as &name suggests , and not to consider it an exception . 
^ does anyone want a vote on this , or may we just do it ?
