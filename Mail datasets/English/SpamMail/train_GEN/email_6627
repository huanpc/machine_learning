^ &name and &name , 
^ &name - i 'll call the phone number i have ( &num &num &num ) before 9am tomorrow morning to speak with you . 
^ seems slightly awkward . 
^ we do n't want to cheese lots of choir and orchestra people off by not saying thank you . 
^ nor do we want to be plying people with alcohol , nor spending lots of money when we 're not breaking even . 
^ i will check re : numbers , costs when i speak to you in the morning , but i suggest budget of &pound; &num for something simple and low key - get some soft drinks and fruit juices ( tell people to bring a bottle if they 're desparate ) , get some haribo or something fun in quantity and leave it at that . 
^ exec - i 'll check my e-mail if you want to come back on this , &name
