^ ok , so for those who are n't aware , version &num was released last night . 
^ there 's more info about it on the website and release announcement . 
^ suffice it to say that we got a lot done , but it took too long . 
^ so anyway , what next ? 
^ well , i 'm going to be taking a break for a few days , perhaps doing some work on the packaging spec which i 've been neglecting lately . 
^ i 've put the next batch of work on the &name list so those who are curious can take a look , it 's intentionally quite short with the only major piece of work being implementing the split versioning schemes as discussed a few weeks ago on &name . 
^ &char brief description for those who were n't there : split versioning is where we separate the concept of package version from interface version completely . 
^ rather than have the skeleton files try and report the version of the package in use , it reports a libtool style version code , like &num , &num and so on , and this is what the packages use to ensure dependancy integrity . 
^ it 's also used to resolve dependancies . 
^ currently versioning is * still * a bit scrappy . 
^ a few other things we might want to do include some &name cleanups , especially in extraction , and improve the documentation . 
^ after the split versioning i suspect the way you make packages will be fairly stable for some time , as most of the new code will be " behind the scenes " as it were , things like guis and network resolvers should n't impact the &name much . 
^ getting to the &name work seems to be taking ages , but i believe it 's important to get a strong foundation before working on what are , essentially , optional features . 
^ &char quick reminder of the roadmap : 
^ &num &num - split versioning , api cleanups , bugfixes , better docs 
^ &num &num - first &name work , improved user interaction &name 
^ &num &num - automatic download code ( for autopackage itself , not packages ) 
^ . . ... after this point &char suspect we 'll have a long list of issues we want to sort out for &num , the rest you can see on the schedule .
