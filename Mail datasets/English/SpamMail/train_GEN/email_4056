^ dear all , 
^ a friend who has just become a christian sent me the following joke this morning ... he 's obviously caught on to some aspects of the church faster than i would have expected ! 
^ ( i wonder if &name &name could use this as a sermon illustration ? ! ) 
^ &name xxx 
^ clergy / leaders " mail-list no. &num 
^ how would the &name church deal with " the cat sat on the mat " if it appeared in the &name ? 
^ the liberal theologians would point out that such a passage did not of course mean that the cat literally sat on the mat . 
^ also , cat and mat had different meanings in those days from today , and anyway , the text should be interpreted according to the customs and practices of the period . 
^ this would lead to an immediate backlash from the evangelicals . 
^ they would make an essential condition of faith that a real physical , living cat , being a domestic pet of the &name domesticus species , and having a whiskered head and furry body , &num legs and a tail , did physically place its whole body on a floor covering , designed for that purpose , and which is on the floor but not of the floor . 
^ the expression " on the floor but not of the floor " would be explained in a leaflet . 
^ meanwhile , the catholics would have developed the festival of the &name of the blessed cat . 
^ this would teach that the cat was white and majestically reclined on a mat of gold thread before its assumption to the &name cat &name of heaven . 
^ this is commemorated by the singing of the &name , lighting &num candles , and ringing a bell &num times . 
^ this would cause a schism with the &name church which believes tradition requires &name &name &name [ as it is colloquially known ] , to be marked by lighting &num candles and ringing the bell &num times . 
^ this would partly be resolved by the cuckoo land declaration recognising the traditional validity of each . 
^ eventually , the house of bishops would issue a statement on the doctrine of the &name &name . 
^ it would explain , traditionally the text describes a domestic feline quadruped superjacent to an unattached covering on a fundamental surface . 
^ for determining its salvific and eschatological significations , we follow the heuristic analytical principles adopted in dealing with the &name &name question [ how much is that doggie in the window ? ] and the &name &name &name [ yes , we have no bananas ] . 
^ and so on , for another &num pages . 
^ the general synod would then commend this report as helpful resource material for clergy to explain to the man in the pew the difficult doctrine of the cat sat on the mat .
