^ in this case , interesting equals " i 'm not sure we would be comfortable with that ! " 
^ just checked on charter flights etc. 
^ i can get you to &name and back from &name for &num pounds . 
^ a flight from &name to &name would be &num pounds . 
^ we would then need to get you from &name to &name &name and back up to &name in some way via a separate booking . 
^ maybe a &num way flight down and bus to &name etc. 
^ you could also not book the &name &name flight and explore other options for that as well . 
^ there is perhaps a charter &num way flight to &name &name but the company i phoned could not come up with anything . 
^ thoughts ?

^ &name &name arrival &num : &num pm 
^ &name is about &num pounds 
^ &num pounds is the price of a charter flight &name to &name we will likely leave on july 21st .

^ just thought it worth asking before i get into the more complicated flight inquiries .
