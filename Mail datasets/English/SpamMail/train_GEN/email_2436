^ by the time came to leave , we were exhausted ! ^  ame was nice , but very hot . ^ we sizzled and fried , and looked at some big old ships too . ^  ame was lovely . ^ go there if you get the chance . ^ it was very gorgeous and picturesque , and it was a nice place to camp . ^ the weather on the whole trip was brilliant , except for  um night on the  ame  ame /  ame border , and the last  um days . ^ we took a very cool spaceship like catamaran ferry from  ame harbour  ame , to  ame ,  ame  ame . ^ it was very fast and smooth , and had a huge observation window all the way around the front and sides of the ship . ^ though we were both born in  ame ,  ame and i both felt an immediate release of tension and a very welcome feeling once we crossed from the states into  ame . ^  ame  ame was great because that is where part of my book was set , and so it was brilliant to be actually able to see the place , and do a little research there . ^ the mist rose and fell like anything . ^ it was quite incredible . ^ the second ferry we took was nothing special , a standard car ferry . ^ still , it was quite fun , and i think i saw a  ame , but you never really can tell with big splashes . ^  ame  ame island was beautiful . ^  ame is the smallest province by far , but it was like a big garden ! ^ there were flowers everywhere , and it was all very lovely . ^ the gently rolling hillsides with good fields full of potatoes ... the soil was very red . ^ because we were in the area , and because i 'm sure many people would hit us if we had n't, we went to see green gables . ^ it was nice . ^ we saw  um herons together on the island shore . ^ i 've never seen that many herons together before . ^ i got to drive over a very long bridge . ^  um km in length ,  um km over water !
