^ apologies for the generalised email . 
^ for those of you who do not know , my sister is severaly disabled by multiple &name . 
^ in one of the recent magazines from the &name trust , they drew attention to the possibility of fundraising by returning empty printer / fax cartridges rather than throwing them away . 
^ this is an extract from the magazine : 
^ 'do you throw away your empty printer and fax cartridges ? 
^ in the last decade it is estimated that printer cartridges worth around &pound; &num , &num , &num , &num were dumped in landfill sites . 
^ they could have been used to provide much-needed cash to worthwhile charities such as the &name trust . 
^ what 's more it takes more than &num pints of oil to make a new toner cartridge . 
^ so if you are guilty of throwing away old printer and fax cartridges , read on ! 
^ the &name trust have teamed up with &name 's largest remanufacturer of printer cartridges , &name &name &name in a scheme that will help boost their fundraising campgain . 
^ everytime a cartridge is donated , the &name trust will receive a cash donation of between 25p and &pound; &num . 
^ perhaps surprisingly it is the smaller cartridges that have the greatest value , so the colour inkjet cartridges commondly used in the home achieve some of the highest donations . 
^ how will i know it i use inkjet or laser / toner cartridges ? 
^ &name cartridges are generally used in the home and are about the size of a fist . 
^ &name / toner cartridges are more likely to be used in an office and are more similar to the size of a forearm . 
^ what if i do n't have many cartridges ? 
^ used inkjet cartridges can be sent individually in a freepost envelope which &name can provide or in a sandwich bag inside and envelope to &name trust , &name &name , &name &name , &name &name . 
^ what if i have &num or more cartirdges ? 
^ simply contact &name and they will send freepost envelopes or boxes , or arrange a collection within &num working days . 
^ contacting &name &name to quote the &name trust to ensure that the money raised will be donated to the &name trust ! 
^ telephone : &num &num . 
^ &name : &num &num email : &email or call &name at the &name trust on &num &num for more information " 
^ please mention this information at work and to your friends and family . 
^ by doing your bit for the environment you can help raise funds to support people with &name .
