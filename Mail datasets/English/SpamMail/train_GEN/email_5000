^ hi professor &name , 
^ hello from &name &name ! 
^ i have now been here a month and am really enjoying the &name in which i am currently enrolled . 
^ the lecturers for this course are all very good , and i am currently leaning about speech recognition and natural language processing . 
^ i am finding that i am using a lot of the material that i learned in your course ( cs30 ) such as finite state machines , context-free grammars , etc. i think that &name has prepared me really well for this &name . 
^ i am still unsure about what i will do next year , once i have finished with the &name . 
^ i am currently applying to graduate schools ( both in the &name and in &name ) , and am also applying for an &name fellowship for graduate research . 
^ part of the &name application requires &num recommendation letters , and i was wondering if you would be willing to write one of these recommendations ( it would be due by december 5th ) . 
^ if you are willing to write a recommendation , please let me know , and i will send you the forms and codes necessary to fill out . 
^ thanks , &name
