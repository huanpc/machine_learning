^ hey &name , 
^ i think i fixed the segmentation fault . 
^ i commented out the delete &char lines and now the program seems to work ( what i think was happening was that the erase method in the hash_map table already calls delete and strange stuff was happening when i got deleted twice ) . 
^ if you get a chance , please run it yourself and tell me if you think it is working .

^ hey &name , 
^ i made a few minor changes and i am sending it back to you . 
^ that way you can send it to &name since you did most of the work . 
^ however , if by tomorrow you still have n't sent it , then i will assume that you ca n't log into the cs server and i will go ahead and send it , but explain that you wrote it . 
^ i will show you the changes that i made on monday - i hope you will agree .
