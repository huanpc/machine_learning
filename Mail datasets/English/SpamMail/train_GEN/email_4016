^ dear &name and &name , 
^ &name - wow , you 're at home with your ( diminished ) family now , enjoying your own room , your mum 's cooking and your brother 's jokes ... &name , how are you ? 
^ you 've been silent for far too long ! 
^ was the igneous petrology just too much for you ? ! 
^ i hope &name is treating you kindly , and is as beautiful as &name looks at the moment ... until the end of term ( last friday ) , i had n't really had time to appreciate the &name , or the daffodils which line the road to the science library . 
^ but this afternoon , a group of us went for a walk in &name &name park . 
^ it was bright and warm , and the sunlight was shining through the leaves of the carpets of flowers , turning them all to that beautiful translucent spring green . 
^ it was the kind of afternoon that makes you want to sing , which is just what we did ... well , &name and i did , anyway ! 
^ i ca n't think why , but we lost &name and &name at that point ... 
^ &name , what else can i tell you about &name ? 
^ yesterday , &name had a friend to visit for the day , so we decided to take her on the &name tour bus ( you know , the open-topped &num which always try to run you over when you cross the street ) . 
^ someone told us that we could avoid paying the fare ( of about &num pounds ) if we dressed up in sub fusc ... and being the poverty-stricken students that we are , about &num of us donned our gowns and " academic ribbons " and boarded the bus , &name making a big show of it as he walked down the aisle with his arms spread wide ( like that bit in &name when he 's walking out of the hall after his first official engagement ! ) . 
^ i think the tour guide was pleased to see us , asked which college we were from , and announced us to the rest of the passengers on the bus . 
^ poor guy , we made him mention &name college , but i do n't think he knew very much about it ! 
^ until wednesday , when i 'm off to &name , i 'm going to be chasing library books around the city , going ice-skating , watching a video ( this is an unusual event while i 'm at college ) , and generally enjoying being in &name without any deadlines . 
^ oh , and i suppose i might just have to do some work while i 'm here . 
^ &name - i escaped the bar on friday night ... 
^ &name ( &char ) had baked &num banana cakes earlier in the day ( ! ! ) , and his friend &name brought his guitar round to my room and played loads of &name and &name songs while i played the tunes on my flute , and everyone else sat around eating cake ! 
^ much better &name " action man and &name " in the bar ... 
^ see you soon ( enjoy the field trip , &name ! ) , 
^ lots of love , 
^ &name xxx
