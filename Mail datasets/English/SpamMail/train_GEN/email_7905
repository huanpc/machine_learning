^ hi &name , 
^ sent your t-shirt off just over a week ago , so you can let me know when you receive it . 
^ the weather is still friggin cold and miserable . 
^ lets hope spring is on the way because this winter has been much , much too long . 
^ we went to &name last weekend and had a good time . 
^ we went down on saturday morning and came back sunday night . 
^ did some shopping , had a couple of good meals and enjoyed ourselves . 
^ mama &name was a great show , well worth seeing . 
^ you 'll have to go see it in &name . 
^ &name is talking about trying to go and see it in &name this summer . 
^ &name is off to &name &name again on monday and will be coming back on thursday . 
^ he 's almost becoming a native . 
^ have n't talked to anyone in the &name recently but will phone &num &name on sunday to see what 's doing . 
^ otherwise not too much going on here , i 've had a bad cold for over a week , were we not meeting another couple in &name i would have probably stayed home last weekend , but i 'm glad i went , even if i was stuffed full of drugs . 
^ hope you are n't working too hard and things are going well . 
^ &name , 
^ &name & &name
