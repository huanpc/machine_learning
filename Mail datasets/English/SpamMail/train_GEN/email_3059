" (  ame  um :  um ) ^ cups of cold water . ^ have you handed any out lately ? ^ has anyone handed a cup of cold water to you lately ? ^  ame delights more in the little spontaneous acts of discipleship than in all our high , complicated theological prognostications . ^ as long as you believe living " in service " to  ame involves only vast global majestic efforts , you will fail to grasp the ways each day we have to give cups of cold water . ^ a cup of cold water is more than just  ame in a  ame cup . ^ a cup of cold water can be a word of encouragement , a prayer , a touch on the shoulder , a simple " i 'm sorry , " a comment like " you look wonderful today ! " or " i 'm glad you 're here ! " it can be buying someone lunch , letting someone else have a parking place , a flower or note to a friend . ^ these are not small things in the impact they can have on someone 's day . ^  har  ame of cold water is whatever you can do . ^ that 's right , folks , we 're all different . ^ we have different personalities . ^ some do certain things better than others . ^  ame has equipped us all with ways to give cups of cold water . ^ maybe you can write notes , make phone calls , or give heartfelt compliments . ^ maybe you can drive someone to church or the hospital . ^ maybe you can help in the teacher 's workroom at church . ^ there are a million ways to serve , many of which are easily within your talents and  ame given capabilities to perform . ^ here 's how it works . ^ a few days ago , i went to visit someone in the hospital recuperating from major surgery . ^ after making the visit , i stood  um minutes waiting for the world 's slowest elevator . ^ the hospital was undergoing remodeling and tempers were short among both visitors and staff . ^ when the door finally opened , i faced about a dozen people -- all tired , all serious looking , and all having waited  um minutes just like i did . ^ i did n't think i 'd fit in , but as the door began to shut , several said " come on , we 'll make room ! " i jumped in just as the door closed and several people gasped " are you okay ? ^ the door almost closed on you ! " i told them i was fine , my only fear was my big stomach would jam the door and put us over the weight limit . ^ several tired  ame rippled through our temporary little elevator community on the way down . ^ i stood jammed at the front , with a steel elevator door about  um half inch from my face . ^ now here 's the deal . ^ i 'll be honest with you . ^ i am a funny guy , i ca n't help it or fix it . ^ i do n't try to be funny . ^ i just am . ^ i was funny as a kid . ^ it got me in trouble then , and it often keeps me in trouble now . ^  ame wired me for humor --  um not  um . ^ i remember  um of all the jokes i hear and they pop out automatically . ^ my mind packs in weird thoughts that come out in humorous ways at odd moments . ^ as a few  ame echoed in the car , i said 'my grandfather made me stand next to him , for hours facing the living room wall ( pause , pause ) he called it elevator practice " . ^ ( that 's a joke by  ame  ame ) elevated laughter ( no pun intended ) . ^ " i had a rough childhood ( pause , pause ) i was toilet-trained at gunpoint . " louder laughter . ^ (  ame  ame ) . ^ 'my folks would play a little joke on me ( pause , pause ) i 'd come home from school and found out they moved . ^ (  ame ) general laughter . ^ " but the worst part , they 'd send me out on  ame ( pause , pause ) as is . ^ (  ame ) ^ the elevator doors opened and i shot down the hall with laughter roaring behind me . ^ that 's almost as good as life gets to me . ^ my wife says i do n't need friends , or family , just an audience . ^ now here 's the point : i gave a cup of cold water using the gifts and personality warp  ame gave me . ^ i did it to help somebody and the best part of it is , it was fun for me . ^ if  ame ever advertises for a court jester , i 'm applying for the job . ^ if  ame can use someone like me , do n't you know , deep down , he can surely , surely use you to give a cup of cold water ? ^ ( the answer is yes , and do n't call me  ame ! ) ^ so join me in finding your own special of way of telling people , " for all you do , this h2o is for you ! " ^ being used by  ame , by  ame  ame ^ he has made major mistakes in his life . ^ some of those mistakes have produced serious pain and sorrow in those who love him . ^ at  um point he did not know if his life was worth living . ^ he was on the verge of destruction . ^ he surrendered his life to  ame . ^ now he has purpose and direction . ^ he has experienced  ame 's grace and is actively sharing a message of hope . ^ he is being used by  ame . ^ she has taught elementary school for over  um years . ^ when she gets home she sometimes forgets to stop using her teacher voice when she speaks to her husband and her own children . ^ there are times she wonders if she is making a difference . ^  um day a little boy came up to her desk after school and told her his mother was very sick . ^ she put down her pen and papers and held him in her arms . ^ she is being used by  ame . ^ he works for a major corporation . ^ most days he feels fairly insignificant and unappreciated . ^  um day he noticed a coworker seemed low-spirited so he invited him to lunch . ^ he listened to the story of a broken home , a broken heart and shattered dreams . ^ he offered a few words of comfort , but mostly he listened . ^ he is being used by  ame . ^ she is young and inexperienced in the ways of ministry , but she loves the  ame . ^ she wants to make a difference . ^ she spent the summer in a strange town , living with a strange family , meeting new people , making new friends , teaching  ame 's word , and demonstrating the godly life . ^ she made a difference . ^ she is being used by  ame . ^ he is getting older . ^ his health is failing . ^ he cannot do all that he once did . ^ he welcomes visitors . ^ he gives a friendly smile . ^ he encourages . ^ he prays . ^ he uses his gifts for the  ame . ^ he wants to do more . ^ he is being used by  ame . ^ she does n't drive at night and there are some days when her arthritis makes it difficult to move . ^ but , she prays for her family , her friends , and for her church . ^ she often sends cards of encouragement and notes that are timely and sweet . ^ she is being used by  ame . ^ he is not old enough to drive . ^ he is not yet into dating . ^ he 's a teenager and trying to find his way with the  ame . ^ there are times when he is confused and frustrated with life . ^ he traveled to a foreign country to help those who needed his help . ^ he is being used by  ame . ^ he is a young man with lots of potential . ^ he is searching to find his place in the world . ^ there are times when he struggles with the difference between what could be and what is . ^ he tries to keep his hopes alive . ^ during the summer he has invested himself in the lives of young children . ^ they look up to him . ^ they admire him . ^ he has changed them by his presence in their lives . ^ he is being used by  ame . ^  ame may never call us to preach to the masses . ^ he may never lead us to a foreign mission field . ^ but , he will work in us and through us to minister to those in need . ^ he will if we will allow ourselves to be used by  ame . ^ " i tell you the truth , anyone who gives a cup of cold water in my name because you belong to  ame will certainly not lose his reward " (  ame  um :  um ,  ame ) ^ let him use you ! </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ how do i subscribe ? ^ it 's free ! ^ to subscribe send a blank email to :  mail </text_embedded><text_normal></text_normal><text_embedded> ^ ( ) my  ame website )  ebsite / <text_embedded> ^ ( ) check out this site )  ebsite ^ * * " work like you do n't need money , love like you 've never been hurt , and dance like  um 's watching' * * </text_embedded></text_embedded><text_normal> ^ do you  ame ! ? ^  ame ! ^ finance - get real-time stock quotes  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
