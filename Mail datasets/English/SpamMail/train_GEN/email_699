^ my telephone number is &num &num &num and you are most welcome to call me as i will be very pleased to hear from you . 
^ i started my nine-week chemistry placement on monday and it looks as though i am going to enjoy it &smiley the chemistry is interesting - and that ( of course ) is the main thing however , i have been getting up at 6am to catch a bus to &name and that is tiring ! 
^ last night i lost my mobile phone and felt such a profound loss that i was quite shaken . 
^ i had left it on an express bus to &name and therefore despaired of all hope of ever seeing it again . 
^ amazingly it was still on the bus when it got back into &name later that evening and i was reunited ! 
^ &name - &name you are enjoying your holiday in &name .

^ &name - hopefully i 'll see you in a week or so sometime . 
^ &name - &name , absent one .
