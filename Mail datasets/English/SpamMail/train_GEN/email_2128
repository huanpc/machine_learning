? ! ! ^ - you have an absolutely one-track mind ! ^ i have no idea ! ^ " you could n't send / scan / e-mail me a copy of it possibly could you ? ^ - possibly . ^ -  ame ! ^ " where do i find it ? ^ [  ame  ame  ame service ] ^ - well , go to  ebsite download "  ame (  ame  ame ) . ^ the entire process should take about  um minutes but it is definitely worth it ! ^ by the way , before you are allowed to download  ame , the web-site will require you to sign up for it . ^ you should think about a suitable username for this . ^ mine is  ame ,  ame 's is "  ame and  ame 's is "  ame . ^ anyway , let me know if you get it . ^ it has enormous potential . ^ " i 'd definitely give you an f in "  ame between the lines  ame ^ - what ! ^ an  har ! ! ^ i want to appeal ! ^ i 'm in a state of shock . ^ " he [ the till an inanimate object ] detected a nasty vibe from you . ^ - now really  ame ! ^ you are far too attached and in-tune with tills . ^ i might be required to add the letters  ame to your name " till  ame . ^ ( very catchy . ) ^ " oh , have psychic powers now too do we ? ? ^ - " too ? ^ as well as what ? ^ no , i do not possess psychic powers . ^ " you had her [  ame ] thoroughly bemused . ^ - excellent ! ^ stage  um completed successfully ! ^  ame will be pleased with this confirmation of our progress ! ^ [ on  ame 's revelation ] 'sounds worrying . ^ we have a slug for a cu rep ? ^ perhaps worse : a cu rep with the characteristics of a slug . ^ worse still : you have a flat-mate with the characteristics of a slug . ^ so ,  ame is slow , leaves slim wherever he goes , and has " uncontrollable mating habits . ^ - i can confirm your worst fears  ame is slow . ^  ame leaves slime wherever he goes . ^ ( any metaphors much appreciated . )  ame has uncontrollable mating habits . ^ i agree with your diagnosis that he is suffering from a stress-induced illness . ^ it is obviously up to us to cure him . ^ but how ? ? ? ^ " i have the ability to pass through a 2-inch thick wooden door . ^ -  ame ^ " you 're paranoid . ^ you 're obsessed . ^ you 're a madman . ^ - you 're gullible . ^ well  ame , i 'm sorry to hear that your grandmother died . ^ i hope you and your family are okay . ^ it is very difficult to come to terms with the idea that someone is just no longer there . ^ when my grandfather died some years ago i did n't feel terribly upset . ^ obviously i loved him , but he lived in another country and i did n't see him often , so it did n't affect me as i thought perhaps it ought to have . ^ so , i was working yesterday and today i 've been wallpapering and doing some organic chemistry . ^ i 'm looking forward to tomorrow evening because our flat is supposed to be having an online chat ! ^ i do n't think it will be with  ame  ame ( yet ) as i do n't think we have all downloaded it yet , but we might have . ^ anyway , that will hopefully be good fun . ^ i chatted online with  ame on thursday evening , which was quite fun too . ^ would you like to chat online sometime ? ^ you 'll never guess what i got in the post today ! ^ i received a letter from a company offering to sell me a personalised car registration number . ^ the number was "  ame est quite ridiculous ! ^ the price was similarly senseless -  ound;  um . ^ imagine ! ^ some people are just absolutely mad . ^ who on earth would pay that much money for such a thing ? ? ? ^ it 's not even as if i have a car yet ! ^ i hope you are feeling better than you were this morning . ^ is your sister back yet ? ^ did you enjoy going for a walk to the post office and posting all your christmas cards ? ^ well , i 'm hungry . ^ in fact , i 'm starving so i 'm looking forward to dinner ! ^ once again , i 'm sorry that this is a short e-mail but nothing much happens here for me to write about ! ^ i suppose i could make up some fantastically delusional myths yes , that would be fun ^ well , a long time ago in the delta  ame [ all my stories start there , it 's such a happening place ] there was a young computer named  ame . ^ she was a very lonely computer and often wondered where her future lay . ^ she desperately wished that she could have a young computer programmer to love and  ame . ^  um day , she met a raven . ^ this raven was called "  um [ translates to "  ame remember him ] and an aura of  ame enveloped him . ^ in fact , it enveloped him so thickly that young  ame could n't even see him , so she relied on her  ame  ame  ame  ame system ( logos , greek " the word ) . ^ anyway ,  ame and  ame had a heart to binary-matrix talk , the outcome of which changed  ame 's hard-disk forever . ^ shortly after their conversation ( for  ame was very impetuous )  ame successfully pleaded with  ame to transport her to earth . ^ that gallant raven obliged , and ,  ame met up with a strange young man . ^ her first observation was that he had similar characteristics to an amphibious-type creature who had evolved  um million years in a few hours and has mysteriously taken on the form of a large slug with uncontrollable mating habits . ^ however , she could cope with that as she was a very interesting computer herself . ^ anyway , she introduced herself to the young computer scientist ( for that was what he was ) who fell head over heels in love with her ( he was good at gymnastics ) . ^  ame ( for that was this intriguing young programmer 's name ) and  ame were inseparable after that particular display of gymnastics  ame being very impressed with his general humility and speed of speech patterns . ^ the end or just the beginning ? ^ well , make of that what you will  ame . ^ i shall stop now , before i think of any more nonsense ! ^ i look forward to receiving your reply . ^ sincerely , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
