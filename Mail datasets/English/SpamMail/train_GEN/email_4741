^ hi &name , 
^ i did read the man page , and searched the internet for an answer , but could n't find anything . 
^ i 'm using mailto in a similar way to your test , although obviously with more complicated messages . 
^ the script i use is as follows : 
^ # !/bin / csh 
^ if ( $ # argv ! 
^ &num ) then &name " usage : scr ( recipient ) ( message file ) " exit &num endif 
^ set recip $ &num 
^ cat $ &num | mailto $ recip &char " anonymised email " 
^ where the file denoted by $ &num contains an &name marked-up email in the following form , which i want to include verbatim as the body of the email to send : 
^ ( message ) 
^ ( message_body ) it seems to interpret the &name as rich text or something , because when the message is received , the mime header is as follows : 
^ &name : text / richtext 
^ i am sending from " embo " in the &name lab . 
^ i am really looking for a method of forcing mailto to send as plain text . 
^ regards , 
^ &name
