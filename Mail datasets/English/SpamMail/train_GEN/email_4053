^ dear mum , dad , &name , and &name , 
^ &char quick email / letter during lunch here ( honestly , mum , it becomes a letter when dad prints this out , really it does ! ) . 
^ i just wanted to say thank you for the great weekend i had these past few days . 
^ you all had really long trips to make , but i really appreciated them -- it made the weekend to have you here . 
^ although the presents were great as well , the best bit was just seeing you all . 
^ the lunch was really excellent ; it was a shame the &name was so full because it really is a nice place , but the &name &name was a very good substitute ! 
^ it was good to get out of &name a bit also . 
^ thanks for all your gifts ; &name , the tools and helmet were badly needed and have already been put to good use ; the lamp makes my room a lot nicer and means i do n't have to look into the overhead light when i 'm lying on my bed . 
^ our house ( as you no doubt noted ) is lacking a coffee table , but no longer a coffee table book ( thanks to &name ) ; that was a very nice idea and full of incredible photos ( i take it you leafed through it before giving it to me ? ) . 
^ the &name is very funny and must have taken a lot of hard work -- thank you . 
^ my housemates have already requested repeat hearings of some of the tracks ! 
^ &name , i hope you got back to &name ok . 
^ &name in there for a couple weeks , and then you can enjoy a holly jolly christmas without a rock or &name in sight . 
^ thanks for all your help on saturday night ; i think without you and &name it really would not have happened ! 
^ i just enjoyed reading about &name 's current champion 's league position , and how &name managed to vote succesfully in &num day ! 
^ i 'm trying to keep in touch with some of the news outside &name , with limited success . 
^ &name , i 'd better get back to work . 
^ just a few more days ... tonight is &name 's concert , then hockey practice , so i have only an hour or so to finish off &num worksheet . 
^ we 'll see if that 's feasible . 
^ i must also get some invites out to &name and others for tomorrow 's &name service ! 
^ thanks again for a great weekend , 
^ love , 
^ &name 
^ &name i found my watch , it had fallen off my dresser into my drawer !
