^ to those of you who do n't know , this is also coming from your old pal &name &name , so do n't delete it just because its from a strange address . 
^ read it . 
^ it 'll be fun ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ anyway. . 
^ we have tried to write twice in the past month or so , but twice we have been thwarted by overzealous computers ever hungry for unsent emails . 
^ they were both really funny , but the gist was : we did some cool stuff . 
^ we are now in new &name and are ready to do some more cool stuff . 
^ in between these blocks of cool stuff we have been to &name , which was nice . 
^ it was raining when we arrived and did n't stop for &num days . 
^ indeed , it developed into a fully blown tropical cyclone ( cyclone &name no less ) where parts of our hut blew away and rain leaked in through the roof . 
^ it was as wet as freds underarm . 
^ &name was there to vouch for all this ( even the underarm part) . 
^ our own underarms then approached witham status as the weather improved and the sun came out . 
^ this oppressive heat called for several cooling off periods in the river of the village where we went to stay . 
^ balls out . 
^ ( apparently this is a local tradition - our guide seemed very keen for the young ms miller to remove her garb , but didnt seem overly disappointed with our offerings) . 
^ in new &name , we have been up the tallest building in the southern hemisphere , and are now in a place called rotorua which &name would love - the reason being that he could fart as and when he pleased and nobody would know or care as the whole place smells of fart all the time due to geothermal activity ( thats right &name - fart smells and interesting rock things - heaven ! ! ! ! ! ! ) if we can be bothered we might tell you about the other cool stuff we did ( the first lot ) next time ... maybe . 
^ till then adios 
^ &name and &name 
^ &name &name , no tengo ganas a escribir mesajes en &name ahora , pero pensaba que un e-mail en &name es mejor de nada .
