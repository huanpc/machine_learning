^ at least &num reward vouchers " worth of points were on that card . 
^ furthermore , points from a saved receipt should have been transferred onto my nectar card , which included a bonus &num points from a special offer . 
^ none of these points have appearded on my nectar card , and i am enquiring as to whether there has been some mistake ... ? 
^ thanks for your help ,
