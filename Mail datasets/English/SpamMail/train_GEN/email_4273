^ &name boys 
^ our first match is this monday against &name seconds . 
^ we are playing at &name astro at 1pm , which means that we should meet in the plodge at 
^ &num &num . 
^ basically , catz astro is a bit of a journey , which means that everyone 's gonna need a bike . 
^ &name however gets to go in a taxi with his goalie kit , with me and &name coz we 're clearly too old for all that cycling . 
^ &name / &name , will either of you be able to take the freshers to the pitch ? 
^ if anyone would prefer to go straight there let me know and i 'll give you directions . 
^ new kits should arrive soon , but in the meantime i do n't have any to give to the freshers , so could you guys please wear white shirts . 
^ for everyone else please wear last years shirt until our sexy new kit arrives . 
^ we have to provide an umpire for the match following ours which starts at &num . 
^ everyone will have to umpire &num match during the course of the season , so if anyone would like to get theirs out of the way let me know . 
^ what i need all of you to do now is to confirm whether you are able to play in the match , and whether you want to meet in the plodge or straight at the ground . 
^ please let me know asap , so i can avoid rushing around chasing people up . 
^ everyone who wants to play will definitely get a game , at least &num minutes . 
^ &name , could you ask &name if he can make it as i dont have his email address yet . 
^ if i dont have your phone number yet , could you please include that in your reply as well . 
^ if anyone has any questions just email me or reach me on &num . 
^ cheers 
^ &name 
^ p.s. highly recommend the formal hall , we 'll all get blind drunk , go to &name 's and puke in mysterious places . 
^ &name wait . . ...
