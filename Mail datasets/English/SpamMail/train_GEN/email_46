^ natural language and information processing group seminar &website /

^ &name : &name - a &name &name approach to &name &name . 
^ speaker : &name &name - &name university 
^ &name : 
^ &name is a type of figurative language where &num entity is used to refer to another related entity . 
^ a typical example is ( &num ) does he drive a &name ? 
^ in ( &num ) , the name of a company " &name " is used to refer to a car produced by that company . 
^ most traditional approaches to metonymy understanding rely on large amounts of world knowledge and are not easily scalable and / or portable . 
^ in the mascara project we explored supervised statistical classification methods as an alternative approach . 
^ we will present the following results : 
^ &num the regularity and productivity of metonymic readings make it possible to reduce metonymy understanding to a classification task comparable to classic word sense disambiguation for the large majority of metonymic readings . 
^ &num grammatical argument-head relations are an appropriate feature for such a classification task and , in particular , more predictive for metonymy recognition than e.g. , collocations . 
^ &num data sparseness in argument-head relations can be at least partially overcome by the integration of thesaurus information without increasing the size of the training data . 
^ &num we also explore the effect that parser accuracy has on the recognition algorithm and compare the difficulty of metonymy recognition to classic word sense disambiguation .
