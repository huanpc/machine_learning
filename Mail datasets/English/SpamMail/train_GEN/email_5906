^ hi all , 
^ to ensure a good role delegation of roles , i was hoping we could adopt the following modus operandi . 
^ after much thought , i think we should split up to take up the following roles : we could definitely add-subtract to these at todays meeting . 
^ we should settle our top &num choices + what roles according to us would be best suited for other team members . 
^ this would hasten the process of role-delegation . 
^ project manager # &num - &name &name &name manager # &num - &name &name &name manager # &num - &name &name &name - big integer + &name side programmer - &name + &name &name &name &name / system analyst - in-depth knowledge of what the project problem demands / involves . 
^ &name / &name &name / system analyst # &num
