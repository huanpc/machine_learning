^ hope you 're a genius . 
^ i think this is fine . 
^ harsh , but probably the best way forward . 
^ by the way , do you and &name ( or some other random friend ) want to come over to my house for dinner on saturday ? 
^ i 'll try and get &name ( or one of my random friends ) to come along as well . 
^ &name ,

^ this is what i 've composed . 
^ i have n't sent it yet and reading it through it seems fairly harsh but let me know what you think . ... is there anything else i 've missed out that i said that i was going to include last night ? 
^ hope the exams were ok , &name 
^ hi &name , these are just a few thoughts which hopefully will help you ... i 'll try to be as honest and helpful as possible . 
^ firstly , even though you say that you are not " interested " in &name , i think that some of your actions maybe do n't match up with this . 
^ even if your intentions are perfectly platonic i think that ringing someone from a foreign country is quite a big thing and i 'm not sure that if it was me i 'd ring someone of the opposite sex unless they were my boyfriend or a very good friend that i 'd known for a long time . 
^ i think that &name understands that you are not " interested " in her , as you 've said this to her , but i also think that &name 's friendship is hers to give and you ca n't expect that you have a right to be friends with someone . 
^ i think that &name must be feeling that she does n't know you well and if she does n't want to get to know you then that is her choice and i do n't think that anyone can force her to do anything . 
^ relationships take a lot of work and commitment at the best of times and i think that a purely platonic friendship that is no more than casual is a very unusual thing between guys and girls . 
^ it takes a lot of time to get to know people well and especially for there to be no misunderstandings and confusions between people of the opposite sex . 
^ i think that &name has probably made it clear that she has perhaps felt uncomfortable with your actions at times and does n't want to have a close friendship with you . 
^ even if this is n't what you want , it is her wish and you have to accept it and respect it by doing what she says . 
^ you say that she seemed to show you that she wanted to be in touch with you but maybe this was n't any more than her just being a genuinely nice person . 
^ she is a nice , caring , kind person and treats all people in a kind way . 
^ maybe , because you wanted to be in touch with her , you misinterpreted her words . 
^ she did n't respond to your phone calls or emails so maybe you should 've taken that as a sign that she was n't interested in pursuing a friendship or a relationship with you . 
^ i think that continuing with these attentions can perhaps seem threatening to a girl and can make her feel uncomfortable , especially , if like &name , she is n't used to having to be unkind to people . 
^ i hope that some of this is helpful to you and that it can perhaps help you to make sense of what 's happened . 
^ i do n't think that girls mind at all if you try to foster a friendship or relationship with them , but they will give you indicators as to if they then want to respond to this , ie they will phone you or email you back , but if they do n't respond then you probably need to accept that perhaps they are n't wanting that friendship or relationship , and perhaps you have to accept that if they are giving you these signals . 
^ unfortunately we ca n't make people want to be friends with us . ... 
^ i hope that this helps and that you can have some time to focus on other friendships when you go back to &name , 
^ all the best , &name

^ hi &name , 
^ i 'd really appreciate it if you could help me out . 
^ it 's a pretty sensitive issue . 
^ i seem to be having some real problems with &name . 
^ i think there must have been a huge amount of confusion somewhere along the line . 
^ i think somehow she must have got the wrong impression , anyway she seems to be upset with me . 
^ well and i 'm really angry and upset with her . 
^ just to make &num thing clear , i do n't have any romatic intentions towards her . 
^ yesterday i called her and said hi . 
^ how are you ? 
^ she said . 
^ i 'm ok . 
^ i do n't know you especially well and i do n't especially want to get to know you any better . 
^ i do n't want you to call me again . 
^ you just ca n't go around calling random people . 
^ bye . 
^ even if she thinks of me as a random person , she 's always been prepared to speak to me before . 
^ but i always thought we were mates and i feel she 'd made it clear she wanted to stay in contact with me . 
^ i did leave a message for her last sunday saying basically : thanks for the paracetamol you gave me . 
^ it has helped and it was kind and thoughtful . 
^ also i 'm unhappy with you about a couple of things that i want to be resolved . 
^ i 'm just a bit bewildered as to what has made her react like this and why she would n't even talk to me about things . 
^ i was prepared to compromise so we could hopefully reach some sort of amicable arrangement to me mates when we go back to &name . 
^ before yesterday i did feel really aggrieved with her about a couple of things . 
^ i thought she was really rude , unwelcoming and unfriendly to me when i went to see her on the &name &name weekend . 
^ it was n't easy for me to go and see her and i did try and drop a hint to say i was n't trying to impress her . 
^ she made it very clear ( again ! ) that she did n't have romantic intentions towards me , but i thought she could make an effort to talk to me and i felt really awkward to say anything . 
^ so i left . 
^ the second thing is that i 've tried to be really open and honest with her . 
^ as far as i 'm concerned she told me clearly she would keep in touch with me . 
^ something she has failed to do , i called her from &name mainly to find out what was going on and from what was said during that conversation i was definitely expecting to hear from her . 
^ again i heard nothing . 
^ i feel she 's really let me down . 
^ i know the female mind works differently to the male mind and i was hoping you might be able to help explain where we might have got confused . 
^ i know there are things that might have been misinterpreted but i have only tried to treat her like a friend - like i would treat anybody else . 
^ what would you suggest i do ? 
^ i 've already spoken to a male friend and i have emailed her to try and straighten things out a bit . 
^ do n't worry i 'm not going to call her again . 
^ i know it 's a bit much and i 'd entirely understand if you did n't want to but is there any chance you could find out what 's going on ? 
^ thanks for listening
