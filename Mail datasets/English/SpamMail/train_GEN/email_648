^ &name . 
^ no , i was not there . 
^ i am tempted to say something sarcastic at this point , but i cannot choose from my many options . 
^ i saw it in &name 's as part of mission . 
^ i imagine your description of your day in the lab amused many . 
^ what are we doing on friday ? 
^ just kidding . 
^ of course i 'll be there . 
^ looking forward to it ! 
^ if you are talking about &name , he said ( and i quote ) " hey- i have always found the resemblance rather flattering " , so i doubt he is unaware . 
^ but he did n't say " okily-dokily folks ! " , which would have made my year , if not my lifetime . 
^ i am distracting myself and must go .

^ dear &name , 
^ when did you watch the matrix ? 
^ i watched it yesterday afternoon . 
^ you were n't there , were you ? 
^ it was quite disgusting . 
^ hope you are getting on well with your essay . 
^ it was nice to see you a few minutes ago . 
^ i have been in the lab all day today . 
^ i am doing an experiment in which one has to vibrate a tube for &num hours - most tedious , and it makes the usual dinner-time question of 'so , what did you do today ? " rather difficult to answer . 
^ as you say , the things chemists get up to . 
^ looking forward to seeing you on friday . 
^ &name &name &name . 
^ i really must read some of the other books some time . 
^ what did you think of the service last night ? 
^ you know , i was discussing this with &name afterwards , and we came to the conclusion that he really is oblivious to his look-a-like status . 
^ have a good time at home . 
^ love &name
