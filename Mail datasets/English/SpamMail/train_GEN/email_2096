" ^ - well , to be honest , not all the time , but quite often . ^ you see , i write to her when i know that she is in her little office . ^ her computer is very clever and obligingly beeps when an email arrives in her inbox , so she tends to read then straight away and reply at the same time - hence , i often recieve a reply within  um minutes ! ^ " )in my book corny and bad are the same . " ^ - you need to rewrite your book . ^ " )obviously you would get rid of the lamb when it became a sheep . " ^ - makes sense . ^ but , when does a lamb become a sheep ? ^ is there a defining line ? ^ or is it just when they lose their " cuteness " and their sweet little bleats decend into a gutteral " baaaaaaaaaaaaa " ! ! ? ? ^ " )- i say i have plenty tales to tell . ^ they are in your  ame inbox . ^ tell your </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ sister that these be high matters not for  ame mortals . " ^ - i have now seen the emissary ! ! ! ! ! ^ very good stuff  ame ! ^ where did you get that picture of  ame (  har ) ! ^ i 'm so glad that  ame 's mission is after pigeons - yippee ! ! ! ! ^ and , are you dissing my  ame ? ^ she is no mere mortal , you know ! ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " )why do n't you like prize-givings ? ^ i loved them ! ^ you got money ! " ^ - yes , i liked the bit where you got money . ^ i do n't like the bit where you do n't, but have to sit through watching hundreds of girls  ame accross the stage at the  ame hall , and have to sit through the most tedious speeches from the headteacher , head girl , head of the governors . . ... the list is endless . ^ " ) excellence is never an accident " ^ - i 'm delighted to hear it . ^ well , so , i went to  ame today . ^ i took a whole load of my stuff through and arranged it in my room . ^ i did not forget your request either ! ^ here are the dimensions you required : the height of the desks above the ground are 70cm ( ie , distance between bottom of desktop and the floor ) . ^ the distance between the bottom of the  ebsite . ^  ame this helps ! ^ what do you want to know for anyway ( i 'm curious ! ) . ^ my apologies if your desk has differing dimensions to mine - that 's not my fault . ^ our flat looks like it 's been lived in for weeks . ^  ame has made herself quite at home - it looked like a dump ! ^ well , she did only move in yesterday , and it was her birthday on sunday , so she has some excuse . ^ i did n't see her anywhere about , nor did i see  ame or  ame , who , as i understood from  ame , were back too . ^ i did see  ame though - have you heard from him at all ? ^ he is leaving ! ^ he 's going back to  ame and is joining the army ! ^ rather a surprise there ! ^ he 's in  ame until monday , so i 'll have to have a good chat with him before he goes . ^ i understand that he failed most of his re-takes , and has scrapped the idea of re-doing the year , so is just going to leave instead . ^ he 's come back to  ame to collect the stuff he left here , i guess . ^ in the words of  ame : " poor old  ame " . ^ speaking of  ame (  ame ) , i still have n't done anything with that picture ! ^ i forgot about it , and discovered it with other pictures when i was packing yesterday . ^ i need some bright ideas ! ^ he is back , according to  ame , as is  ame ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame . . ... and my other flat mate -  ame  ame - arrived just as i was leaving . ^  ame is coming back on saturday , and i do n't know when  ame is going to come . ^ i 'm going for good on friday . ^ i decided to stay till then as mam did n't want me to go till then ( she 's wondering what she 's going to do without me to make the meals and do the cleaning - although i think she may miss me a bit too ! ! ) , and i want to go to a meeting tomorrow night . ^ it 's a talk on science and the  ame , and is called " has science  ame  ame ? " . ^ i hope it 's interesting . ^ well , gotta go . ^ i am whacked and i need to go to bed . ^ we have just spent the last  um hours debating " prayer " , and it has totally worn me out . ^ how would you define prayer ? ^ bye for now - see you on saturday . ^ from  ame get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite . ^ share information about yourself , create your own public profile at  ebsite . </text_normal></message_body></message>
