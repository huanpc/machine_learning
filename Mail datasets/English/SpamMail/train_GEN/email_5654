^ hi all , sorry to use the list to shamelessly plug my concert ... 
^ i sing with &name &name &name &name . 
^ we are performing on thursday night ( ie. tomorrow ) at the &name theatre at 11pm . 
^ tickets are &pound; &num . 
^ it would be cool if some of you wanted to come along . 
^ yes , i know it 's ridiculously late , but there 's nothing i can do about that . 
^ also performing in the same slot is &name &name , an afro-cuban drumming outfit . 
^ could be interesting ?
