^ dear &name and &name - 
^ i feel dreadful that it has taken me so long to write , but i was enormously touched by your card and the wonderful box of biscuits that you left for me . 
^ they are now in the organ loft at &name 's and consumed on a daily basis ! 
^ i 'm so glad that the &name &name was all round such a great success . 
^ that 's nearly all down to your hard work behind the scenes - a very demanding and thankless job for you both . 
^ i was glad to be involved in the whole project , and i hope that it made a lot of people think . 
^ i hope your term has been going well - enjoy the &name break if i do n't see you before . 
^ best wishes , and thanks again .
