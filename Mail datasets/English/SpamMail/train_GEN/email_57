^ +do n't buy formal tickets for friday yet ! 
^ if you have , then it 's easy to go to the catering manager and explain that you do n't want the ticket that you booked . 
^ +the 2nd day of cuppers is going to happen next sunday ( weather permitting ) with the same times for events , and the points from yesterday 's events carried forward . 
^ i will have to chat to the catering manager , but i will try and rearrange our formal for the week after that . 
^ i will email you to tell you what is happening in the next few days . 
^ +in case you did n't know , at the moment we lie about 4th / 5th in the competition ( which is fantastic ! )
