^ printers are being moved to the &name in phases over the next few weeks , so people who have moved and those who have yet to move should still be able to find a working printer , although for some people this may temporarily involve a longer walk than usual . 
^ once we have all moved to the &name most people will be nearer to a printer than they are now . 
^ the &name command " lpq &char " gives a listing of known printers with their locations . 
^ i will attempt to keep this location information up to date , so you should always check before you print something ( or you may have a very long walk to collect your output ! ) 
^ a pointer to a web page giving the locations of printers and their provisional moving dates is on &website 
^ &num printer will be placed in &name and will remain there after we have moved for the use of staff working in the &name . 
^ &name
