^ that really is sad ... &name should be fired for how he used him last year ... and he was n't that careful with him this year either . 
^ this whole incident was so predictible . 
^ by the way , my pick-up of &name was before you sent me that email . 
^ talked to &name tonight . 
^ got some doctor advice on what i was saying &name was commenting on before . 
^ i still refuse to discuss this over email , plus you will no doubt give me as much sh * &char as &name has been giving me . 
^ meanwhile , &name has a potential boyfriend - hopefully that will work out for her . 
^ i hear you 'll be going to buffalo in september for the pats game . 
^ i do n't think i 'll be able to go as that is right when &org will be starting . 
^ anyway , way past my bedtime . 
^ more later .
