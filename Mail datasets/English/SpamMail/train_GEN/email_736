^ &name , 
^ i have now done &num days of my job . 
^ i have actually run out of things to do , because my supervisor is in &name . 
^ thus , i am working on a little messenger program i wrote a year or so ago , which sends instant messages around to any computer in the company . 
^ it is quite a lot of fun . 
^ today i finished writing a data sorting program , which was also quite a satisfying task . 
^ i am not that good at getting up early , but i 'm managing it fairly successfully so far . 
^ it would be a lot harder if it was not so light in the mornings - praise &name for the sun ! 
^ tomorrow i am playing football at lunch-time . 
^ i am part of a five-a-side team called 'mad dogs and englishmen " . 
^ we should win , but the manager has told us to try and make sure that we either draw or lose , so that we do n't end up in the harder part of the draw for the cup ( it 's quite complicated ) . 
^ anyway , it should be fun . 
^ stuffed &num - hhhmmmmmm . 
^ say hi to &name for me . 
^ love from
