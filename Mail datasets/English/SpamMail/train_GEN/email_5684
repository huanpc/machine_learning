^ &name , &name - see below message from the undergraduate green officer . 
^ if there is interest among the graduates and someone would like to be a graduate green officer let me know . 
^ thanks , &name my name in &name &name , i 'm the &name officer for the undergraduates , but so far have had little to do with the graduates . 
^ it would be good if there was more interaction because a scheme that i set up can be easily operated throughout college , rather than being confined to the undergraduates . 
^ firstly , paper recycling bins . 
^ the deal is that college will provide students with ( fire-proof ) metal bins . 
^ a bin can be collected from mrs. &name " office in garden court . 
^ we have to empty them ourselves , so please negotiate this with your bedder . 
^ the paper bins to empty them into are in dustbin &name , which is to the t.v. room side of chapel court . 
^ secondly , the green group . 
^ i have recently set up a green group . 
^ it is still quite embryonic , but it will probably operate in the following way : we meet up and discuss what could be done in college to reduce our environmental impact , then people who are interested in particular areas can go and do what has been decided . 
^ if anyone would like to be involved then please email me and i 'll pop you on the list and send you the minutes of todays meeting . 
^ thanks - &name .
