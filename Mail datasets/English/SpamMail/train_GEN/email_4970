^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your email and remembering me &smiley 
^ after much discussion with my friends , family , and advisors , i have decided that i unfortunately must decline this wonderful opportunity to study at the university of &name in &num . 
^ although the opportunity to work with dr. &name is really appealing , and the cross-departmental collaborative atmosphere at &name would really facilitate my interests in combining database technology and the biological sciences , i have decided that the location of &name does n't fit with where i want to spend the next &num years of my life . 
^ this year in &name has made me realize that the location of a school can really affect quality of life , and being near my family and friends in northern &name or &name &name has become increasingly important to me . 
^ not taking the opportunity to study at one of the top &num schools in computer science in &name might sound ridiculous , but for me extraneous factors take probably a higher priority than they should . 
^ my plans for next year are not at all clear , but i have applied to a few schools in &name &name and &name &name , and if i am not accepted then i think i will find a job near &name . 
^ i hope that this email is sent in time so that my decision is reflected in your calculation of the target number of &num applicants .
