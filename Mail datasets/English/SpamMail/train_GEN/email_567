^ &name , can you really tell me that you did n't recognise the superiority of my verse to &name 's, and my own especial distinctive style ? 
^ i am disgusted at your lack of taste and culture . 
^ i am going to inspect your room before long and tell you whether it passes my high standards . 
^ they are higher than &name 's; i have seen her room . 
^ i did leave &name a message on his door . 
^ obviously neither of you can read . 
^ we ask where you are because we do n't know , dimwit . 
^ we do n't know exactly where you are . 
^ and writing " &name , where are you ? 
^ see you soon , &name " is better &name " &name , you troll , you 're obviously out seducing an innocent first-year . 
^ leave them alone , you skulking great monster . " is n't it ? 
^ &name , great to see you yesterday . 
^ i 'll see you later . 
^ in about &num minutes , actually . 
^ when can i come for a sleepover ? 
^ ( with &name too , of course ) .

^ dear &name and &name , 
^ thank you for the messages you left on my door . 
^ i assume they were from you as they had your names after them . 
^ if they were forged then please ignore this e-mail . 
^ why does everyone ask me where i am today ? 
^ lectures have started - of course ! 
^ i have put some pictures up on my walls &name , and &name says my room now passes . 
^ &name . 
^ i still have a long way to go though . 
^ you both may be interested to know ( though i doubt it ) that &name ( also known as " that horrible stuffed creature " ) has now found a permanent home with our intrepid &name &name who , incidentally , was mortified that he received no messages when you had both been so close to his room ( a feat of tremendous endurance in itself and really he ought n't ask for any more ) . 
^ hope you are both well and had enjoyable days , 
^ love &name
