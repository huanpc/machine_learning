^ this is a long and in-depth e-mail . 
^ please do n't read it unless you have time . 
^ thank you . 
^ dear &name , 
^ please do n't let your mother find out about our secret love affair . 
^ ( i am not being serious , but i guess you worked that out . ) 
^ it was good to hear from you yesterday . 
^ anyway , the tricks 
^ &name left for the geology department at 2pm on tuesday . 
^ i duly went down to the &name trading company and bought a substantial quantity of grass seeds for &pound; &num . 
^ i had been anxious that sowing grass seeds would do lasting damage to the carpet and that i would therefore be in a rather sticky situation . 
^ therefore , i decided to do as follows 
^ i went to the &name &name and asked the lady there if i could borrow the keys for one of my friend 's rooms as they had forgotten to turn off their storage heaters before going home . 
^ she willing obliged but asked me to bring them straight back . 
^ i then quickly returned to the flat and opened &name 's room , placing on the floor a bin-liner on top of which i spread a damp dish-towel , sprinkling grass seed liberally over its surface . 
^ i then watered the towel and rushed back with the keys , after hastily turning off &name 's heater and checking &name 's. 
^ the lady was most thankful . 
^ so , i did n't carry out the trick as planned , for the carpet does not belong to me . 
^ i would have had no hesitation if it was &name 's or mine , but it is n't. 
^ however , it should still be amusing for &name to return and find a patch of grass growing in his bedroom , though he had locked the door . 
^ now , trick number &num 
^ earlier that day i made my way over to &name &char to see &name . 
^ he obliged by giving me the relevant details but warned me that you had better not try to sell his stereo system . 
^ anyway , i tried to call &name and find out about his guitar - &name only knew it was a &name &name guitar , and that &name had got it in a sale for about &pound; &num . 
^ unfortunately &name was n't answering . 
^ since time was quickly marching on i could n't go to &name to post &name 's advertisement , and i had n't the necessary information from &name anyway . 
^ so , this trick has not yet been completed . 
^ however , i intend to go down to &name sometime during the holidays and i will finish it then . 
^ in any case , that will only serve to make it even less understandable for &name , since the phone calls are not going to begin immediately after the holidays start . 
^ well , on tuesday i also managed to clean most of the flat , including the shower and bathroom . 
^ i also walked to the science site to visit the library and show my friend where the &name department was . 
^ in addition to that i defrosted and cleaned our fridge / freezer , and also cleaned my room with the utmost thoroughness . 
^ after that i had to pack my room , and as a result of my hectic morning , after busying myself with all this running around , i had to rush frantically to the railway station . 
^ i arrived on the platform , much out of breath due to the rather weighty nature of my bags , to see the train pulling out of the station . 
^ my heart sank , as the next train was not due for at least an hour . 
^ thankfully it was not my train , which had been delayed by the ineptitude of &name by &num minutes . 
^ this was &num time when i was thankful for inefficiency . 
^ eventually my train arrived and i embarked upon my journey , sad to leave &name . 
^ my train was then delayed my vandalising children on the railway track . 
^ i arrived at &name over &num minutes late , but still in &num piece and much calmer than i had been while rushing to try and catch my train . 
^ now , i will keep you up to date with the latest happenings in that exiting focal point of all our lives , &name &name well , on monday evening &name invited &name and &name and &num first year &name girls for dinner . 
^ the meal was most delicious , and afterwards one of the first years was given the opportunity to cut &name 's golden locks - a most amusing occurrence indeed . 
^ the poor unfortunate girl was halfway through the task when she accidentally cut some of &name 's ear off . 
^ now , you know what &name is like when he gets angry about something well actually , he did n't assault her , but he yelled and almost cursed about it for a substantial number of minutes . 
^ i think the blood contrasted beautifully with his pale complexion . 
^ so &name now has a mutilated ear , something he will doubtless cherish as it was done at the hands of one of his favoured girls . 
^ i wonder if we could make him think we had paid &name ( the unfortunate girl ) to carry out her heroic deed ? 
^ imagine his reaction ! 
^ anyway , are you well ? 
^ was your trip to &name library beneficial ? 
^ are you pleased to be at home and did you enjoy your night our yesterday ? 
^ when you sent your last e-mail i was in the middle of a power cut . 
^ at &num : &name i was gaily about to check my e-mail , when the computer switched off and i was plunged into darkness . 
^ we proceeded to eat our dinner by the light of oil lamps . 
^ we lit our fire and &num the played the piano by candlelight for half an hour . 
^ it was very beautiful , but could get boring quite easily . 
^ i then went up to my room , oil lamp in hand , and began to study . 
^ at &name the electricity came back on and i received your e-mail . 
^ thank you . 
^ my next piece of uninteresting trivia is that i now have absolutely free internet access at any time of the day or night ! 
^ we have signed up to ntl , the telephone company , and that is why i am sending you this in the middle of the day . 
^ any time you wish to chat online just let me know , as it would be fun . 
^ also , if you want &name &name &name service , it can be downloaded from the following location ... 
^ &website o73026 
^ &name is going to get it , and possibly others . 
^ it is an extremely interesting piece of software which allows you to chat easily ( via text or voice ) online . 
^ it also allows you to see whether your friends are online if you or they want . 
^ it 's fun . 
^ well , i have written some words to you , and i hope you are well and enjoying your holidays . 
^ write back to me soon . 
^ i look forward to hearing from you . 
^ &name
