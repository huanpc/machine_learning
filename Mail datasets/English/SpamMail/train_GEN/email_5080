^ the new telephone handsets we 've been installing in the &name are of &num types : 
^ - the cheap and cheerful &name - a basic telephone with no fancy features 
^ - the converse &num - a more elaborate phone with memories and handsfree facilities 
^ we 've generally given the converse phone to staff we thought would be likely to make use of the extra facilities , but this was pretty much guesswork . 
^ we are now running a little short of converse phones , but before ordering more , i would like to check what is needed . 
^ so : 
^ - if you have been given a converse phone , but do not feel that you will make use of the extra facilities , please let me know and we will swap it for an &name . 
^ - if you 've been given an &name , but would value the extra facilities of a converse , please say so , however i am unlikely to be able to change it immediately unless there is a huge rush of swaps in the other direction . 
^ - if anybody is particularly attached to the statesman handset used in the old building we can bring over some of the less tatty specimens . 
^ they can no longer be bought new . 
^ - the converse has a facility for plugging in a headset , and we have some of these available for people who would like them . 
^ a headset gives true hands-free operation , particularly whilst using a computer , where keyboard clatter normally makes speakerphones unusable ( for the person on the other end of the call ) . 
^ please ask for a headset if you would use one , but bear in mind that they cost rather more than the phone itself so please do n't ask for one if you are n't going to use it .
