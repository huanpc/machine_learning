^ dear &name 
^ thank you for the off red large cat score and the torn up music book . 
^ i managed to play the former very quickly and am steadily working throught the latter . 
^ i could do with a piano player for the book to give it more form . 
^ when you come back you may recognise bits ... 
^ in my diary i have a note that you are coming back next weekend . 
^ obviously we need to know if this is still the case so we can make arrangements to fit in our other appointments . 
^ please get in contact . 
^ the church 5-a-side football this evening was very rough and i ended up shouting down from the balcony because of the dangerous play and blantant cheating . . ... ! 
^ with love
