^ hmm ... which address did you send it to ? 
^ my &email account was moved to a more reliable service in march or april ( i ca n't remember which ) so they should always get through - i think it would then be something wrong at your end . 
^ as for the &website one , that 's with a notoriously unreliable service , but i do n't want to move it because they offer some pretty neat services for a tiny price & nobody ever uses that e-mail address . 
^ & you seem to have changed address ? ! 
^ do you not use either the &website &num anymore ? 
^ anyway , look forward to meeting up soon & catching up .
