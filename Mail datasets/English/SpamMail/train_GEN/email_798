^ &name ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 
^ ( hi ) 
^ firstly , why does &name seem to think it 's the 3rd of january &num ? 
^ is she that behind the times ? 
^ &name &name . 
^ secondly , i must thank you for sending me &num e-mails whilst i have yet to finish writing one . 
^ thirdly , thanks awfully for sending me your address . 
^ fourthly , &name is very amusing ! 
^ fifthly , my brother is thinking about getting a guitar . 
^ what type do you have ? 
^ ( the &num &name likes . 
^ he could only tell me it was an &name &num , he did n't know the model number etc. ) 
^ yes , i have managed to do some work ! 
^ i 'll be doing some more after i 've finished writing to you . 
^ what on earth did you and &name teach the little beasties at your dad 's school ? 
^ i find the idea very amusing . 
^ well , i got back home on tuesday evening . 
^ my story is as follows 
^ on tuesday i managed to clean most of the flat , including the shower and bathroom . 
^ i also walked to the science site to visit the library and show my friend where the &name department was . 
^ in addition to that i defrosted and cleaned our fridge / freezer , and also cleaned my room with the utmost thoroughness . 
^ after that i had to pack my room , and as a result of my hectic morning , after busying myself with all this running around , i had to rush frantically to the railway station . 
^ i arrived on the platform , much out of breath due to the rather weighty nature of my bags , to see the train pulling out of the station . 
^ my heart sank , as the next train was not due for at least an hour . 
^ thankfully it was not my train , which had been delayed by the ineptitude of &name by &num minutes . 
^ this was &num time when i was thankful for inefficiency . 
^ eventually my train arrived and i embarked upon my journey , sad to leave &name . 
^ my train was then delayed by vandalising children on the railway track . 
^ i arrived in &name over &num minutes late , but still in &num piece and much calmer than i had been while rushing to try and catch my train . 
^ now , i will keep you up to date with the latest happenings in that exiting focal point of all our lives , &name &name well , on monday evening &name invited &name and &name and &num first year cu girls ( &name and &name ) for dinner . 
^ the meal was most delicious , and afterwards one of the first years ( &name ) was given the opportunity to cut &name 's golden locks - a most amusing occurrence indeed . 
^ the poor unfortunate girl was halfway through the task when she accidentally cut some of &name 's ear off . 
^ now , you know what &name is like when he gets angry about something well actually , he did n't assault her , but he yelled and almost cursed about it for a substantial number of minutes . 
^ i think the blood contrasted beautifully with his pale complexion . 
^ so &name now has a mutilated ear , something he will doubtless cherish as it was done at the hands of one of his favoured girls . 
^ seriously though , it was only a small &name . 
^ anyway , are you well ? 
^ yesterday evening i was in the middle of a power cut . 
^ at &num : &name i was gaily about to check my e-mail , when the computer switched off and i was plunged into darkness . 
^ we proceeded to eat our dinner by the light of oil lamps . 
^ we lit our fire and &num the played the piano by candlelight for half an hour . 
^ it was very beautiful , but could get boring quite easily . 
^ i then went up to my room , oil lamp in hand , and began to study . 
^ at 8pm the electricity came back on and i succeeded in checking my e-mail . 
^ my next piece of uninteresting trivia is that i now have absolutely free internet access at any time of the day or night ! 
^ we have signed up to ntl , the telephone company , and that is why i am sending you this in the middle of the day . 
^ any time you wish to chat online just let me know , as it would be fun . 
^ also , if you want &name &name &name service , it can be downloaded from the following location ... 
^ &website o73026 
^ &name others will get it too , as it is an extremely interesting piece of software . 
^ anyway , it is extremely cold here . 
^ i woke up this morning and the temperature was only &num degrees &name . 
^ it feels like i 'm back in january ! 
^ so , write soon , and i hope you get some work done . 
^ &name 
^ " eat one live tree frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of the day "
