^ glad to hear that someone survived the course ! ! 
^ it already seems far too hard , so thanks for giving me the boost of confidence that will be much needed . 
^ thanks also for the kind offer of help etc , which i 'm sure you will regret offering later ! !

^ good luck with your further studies , you must be very dedicated ! !
