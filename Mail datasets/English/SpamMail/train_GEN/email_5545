^ apparently , most of us seem to be interested , but do we have any provisional dates or anything yet ? 
^ what about a monday ? 
^ not this monday but next ? 
^ hi everyone , 
^ now that we have all had a chance to adjust to life and work and work on the &name . 
^ i would like to propose that we arrange an evening event so that we can do a little light hearted networking , and socializing . 
^ as computational linguists we are not great in numbers so i would relish this opportunity to get better acquainted with you all . 
^ i have chatted to a few people on the course about the type of event that would make the most pleasant evening and &name and &name have both recommended that we go out for a meal at a restaurant called " &name house " , which is situated in near proximity to some of &name 's finest pubs and clubs . 
^ we are open to suggestions about events , so if anyone has any good ideas , please step forward and make yourself heard . 
^ i was thinking that we could arrange a date and time between ourselves , perhaps toward the end of next week or the start of the week after that . 
^ so , if you think this might be a fun and worthwhile evening and you are interested in coming along , send me an e-mail , with the time that would suit you best , or e-mail me with any suggestions for events that you have . 
^ please do remember that i will need to know numbers early if i 'm going to make a provisional booking . 
^ &name house &num &name &name &name &name 
^ &name i have heard that the lassi creamy is exceptional at &name house . 
^ hope you can come . 
^ &name
