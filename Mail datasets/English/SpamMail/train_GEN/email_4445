^ ... who could be so sadistic to procreate ?

<text_normal> 

^ all very theoretical and somewhat depressing my friend ! 
^ i 'm personally not at all sure that we have a soul / spirit in the same way that &name does . 
^ but perhaps that is not really relevant , as it seems to be the _imperfection_ of our physical bodies that you are most frustrated by ? ? 
^ if we lived in a " perfect " ( whatever the heck that means ) world , then perhaps physicality would not be such a bad thing ? ?

^ now &name , you ca n't just tar a whole nation with the same brush ! 
^ i would only allow you this sort of generalisation if you could prove to me that you 'd actually personally met and analysed all these disgusting americans that you are so quick to slander !

^ physical bodies are so annoying . 
</text_embedded>

^ yeah , i know what you mean . 
^ i hate it when mine goes wrong . 
^ still , there are lots of good things as well , such as football and music and reason and ( emotion - gasp ) and stuff ! 
</text_embedded>

^ reason and emotion ... and music ... those things do you really need a physical body to accomplish ? 
^ was n't &name angry , jealous , satisfied , repentant , etc without being physically manifest ? 
^ is not &name the father of logical progression , upon which all reason , math , physics , and laws of existence are founded ? 
^ this facet of his nature is a complex ruleset that defines reality . 
^ &char pretty long schema . 
^ and music ? 
^ the saints sing around the throne even as you read this . 
^ and &name played stringed instruments before his fall . 
^ too bad for &name - no drums &smiley but hey ! 
^ music without physical instantiation ! 
^ i think the physical is simply a printout of the image-in-memory . 
^ it is the true object in the system that can create , appreciate , admire , form opinions , reason emote and choose . 
^ the physical printout only eats , farts , cuts itself , stubs its toes , grows old and degenerates , sleeps , trips over , &name itself on hot stuff , and drags the soul around with it everywhere it goes . 
^ perhaps we are encumbered with this hardcopy to keep us subservient and overall inferior to the other spiritual beings ? 
^ but once we are freed of this meatware and are exclusively soulware , then we soar in our newfound freedom to become ultimately supreme . 
^ so why bother with the larval stage ? 
^ why not be initialized at instantiation as a fully-fledged megawave ? 
^ why put us through the torture of grubbing around on a dirtball killing and maiming each other for a few measly pieces of green paper and a litter of snotty-nosed offspring ? 
^ who could be so sadistic to &name could be so sadistic to procreate ?

^ &name thingy ? 
^ americans are pathetic . 
^ i knew their pryminister has all his speachifications wrote for him by other peoples , but this one makes &name sound as bad as the countries they so adamantly oppose . 
^ for once his speachification sounds remotely realistic .
