^ choice in colleges teh &num next door to &name 's, i dont know whether that is a good way to do it or not , i just figured that if you were randomly going to go to something you might be more tempted if it were next door than if it were &num minutes away - &char dunno if that is true tho ... any better ideas as to how to discriminate ? 
^ - &name was just because it is easy for me . . ... 
^ &char left the note in &name 's pidge today , so hopefully she will get it and get back to me soon ...

^ hiya , my hermes account is now back on-line - sending nearly &name of images to &name , &name and &name had n't helped my &name ! ! 
</text_embedded>

^ cool - you know you can ask for an increase in &name if you want it ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ your lot of posters is just mill rd etc - &name reps should get theirs . 
</text_embedded>

^ thanks - &name also confirmed this at lunchtime & pointed out that i just ca n't read and she did make that clear ! 
<text_embedded> 

^ we have a certain amount of flyerage that we can use for colleges - i have left a note to the &name reps to see if they want to blanket flyer &name , 
</text_embedded>

^ that might be a good idea - &name or &name would need to clear this with the college first however , so its probably best that they know your intentions earlier rather than later . 
<text_embedded> 

^ and i can always do &name . 
^ i might ask &name and trinity if thye want it as well 
</text_embedded>

^ is there any particular choice in colleges here ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - we have approx &num for doing blanket flyerings . 
^ but if &char wannna do &name , then hey thats cool - just let me know how many you need . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'm hoping to get it out on &name e-mail lists . 
<text_embedded> 

^ that stilll leaves &num for flt , bt , any sites we wanna do and the cums &num concert on saturday . 
</text_embedded>

^ sounds good 
<text_embedded> 

^ last time i spoke to &name she was getting better but not there yet ... i think that she appreciates still getting emails etc , still feeling that she knows what is going on , even if she is n't doing much herself ... 
</text_embedded>

^ she popped into &name today , so i saw her then which was good . 
^ i think she just could n't bear to rest in bed anymore , but she is seeming a bit better now ( but as you say , she 's still not &num yet ) . 
<text_embedded> 

^ annoying about &name . 
^ will bear it in mind for any future publicity ... 
</text_embedded>

^ cheers 
^ take care ,

^ many thanks &name for all your hard work today - it was fantastic to come out of a supervision today , chatting to my supervision partner about the concert and then for him to say , " you mean , that &name &name &name " pointing to &num people putting up a poster in our faculty . 
^ excellent ! 
<text_embedded> 

^ are st &name 's college ciccu group allowed to do any flyering / whatever in &name or not ? 
</text_embedded>

^ they 're able to put up posters within certain guidelines and we think flyering is probably ok . 
^ i 've asked &name &name ( one of the reps ) to chat to the chapel clerk about it and passed on to him what i know . 
<text_embedded> 

^ all the bundles of posters are out now - reps &num are going in a ciccu bundle tonight , the site / town flyering &num should ( ! ) be in &name holes . 
</text_embedded>

^ great - absolutely great . 
^ many thanks , you 've done a fantastic job . 
^ as for the posters i got today for &name road - is that just &name road area or is the &name lot in there too ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ press releases are done . 
</text_embedded>

^ wow - this is amazing - i sit back and the publicity is all sorted ! 
<text_embedded> 

^ &name says hi . 
</text_embedded>

^ thanks - how is she , do you know ? 
^ &name seemed to be doing a great job covering &name today , but if you do need me to take on any of &name 's work ( or anything else for that matter ) , do let me know . 
^ thank you once again for all you hard work , 
^ take care ,
