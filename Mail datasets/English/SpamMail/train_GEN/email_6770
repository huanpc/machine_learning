^ dear &name , 
^ &name the paper today , we saw that pc &name had an offer on printers . 
^ they were offering a &name &name plus &num laser printer for &pound; &num which is &pound; &num off normal price . 
^ the snag was it was a bank holiday offer only . 
^ &name bought himself &num and when we found that it also came with a spare toner cartridge ( pc world cost &pound; &num ) we thought it was a very good deal indeed so we bought another one with you in mind as dad thought you were looking for a new printer . 
^ if you do n't want it then it is suitable for dad 's school so no problem . 
^ we had a go at contacting you via &name beforehand but were not surprised to find you were not online ! 
^ let us know when you can , 
^ love , mum 
^ outgoing mail is certified virus free . 
^ checked by &name anti-virus system ( &website ) .
