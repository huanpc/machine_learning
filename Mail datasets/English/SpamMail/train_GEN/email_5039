^ &name , &name &name and &name flickinger } { an algebra for semantic construction in constraint-based grammars } { 39th &name &name of the &org ( &name &name &name , &name { 2001 } 
^ but we did n't talk about &name style stuff , or relations in that paper , so that 's a bit obscure as it stands 
^ not &name - that 's &name ( and was n't actually any more underspecified than the original &name ) . 
^ &name for the stuff i 'm doing now , or &name for the original stuff . 
^ how about replacing the bit below : 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ the logic developed in &name and &name ( &num ? ? ) , in effect , defines such a scheme in which predicate names and variables can be underspecified to an arbitrary extent in a parsons-style minimal recursion semantics ( &name ) with explicit equalities representing ( factored ) variable bindings . 
^ for instance , from { it the couple were married } , a system might extract : ( &name &name &name ) ( marry u3 ) ( couple &name ) . 
^ however , the fully specified test suite &name would add : ( &name &name &name ) ( &name &name ) ( &name &name &name ) typing and binding variables and underspecified &name relations .

^ with the following : 
^ the approach to underspecified logical representation developed in &name et &name ( &num ) and &name et &name ( &num ) can be extended to allow semantics to be underspecified to a much greater degree . 
^ in robust &name ( &name ) , a parsons-style notation is used , with explicit equalities representing variable bindings . 
^ for instance , from { it the couple were married } , a system might extract : ( &name &name &name ) ( marry u3 ) ( couple &name ) . 
^ however , the fully specified test suite &name would include ( &name &name &name ) ( marry e2 ) ( couple &name ) , &name , &name , where arg2 is formally a specialization of &name and the equalities also add information . 
^ ( whoops , i 'm late - maybe more later ) 
^ &name
