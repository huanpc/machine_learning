^ i 've already said to &name that i wo n't be able to make the prayer neeting as i have a rehersal for the cums concert tonight but these are a few prayer points 
^ praise 
^ - that all the music seems to have been sorted out ok 
^ - that the concert that &name was due to have that night has now been cancelled ( they could n't fix an orchestra . . ... ! ! ) so it has freed a few more people , including &name ( junior organ scholar ) , who 's not a christian to play in the concert . 
^ pray 
^ - for &name playing , and also for &name and &name who have said that they 'd like to come to watch - that they would be struck by the message as well as the music . 
^ &name it goes well . 
^ looking forward to seeing you next week , 
^ love &name

^ hi everyone ! 
^ hope you 're all well and enjoying the weekend &smiley sorry i 've left this a bit late , but if you happen to check your emails before the prayer meeting today and have anything specific you 'd like us to pray for ( especially if you ca n't make it to the meeting yourself ) , then do let me know and i 'll make a note of it and make sure we pray about it &smiley do n't forget to mention any answers to prayer and other stuff to thank &name for ! 
^ thanks again for all your hard work- it has n't been in vain , as we have a great &name who 's " able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine , according to the power at work within us- to him be the glory in the church and in &name &name , throughout all generations , for ever and ever , &name " ! 
^ hope to see many of you later , love &name 
^ ps does anyone who 's had contact with &name &name know whether there 's anything he 'd especially appreciate prayer for- apart from the obvious ?
