^ &name , 
^ will you be at the flt at 1-2pm tomorrow ? ? 
^ if so , you can take tickets and float from &name after he finishes selling tickets . 
^ i 'll make sure that there are enough . 
^ does this sound ok ? 
^ otherwise , i could bring them up to you at &name hall on my way to the faculty after &name , but we would need to arrange to meet - say , at your porter 's lodge or something ... 
^ thanks so much for your help ! ! ! 
^ &name xx

^ great- thanks for the offer &smiley i 'm not sure now how sensible it was of me to ask you- given that you 're already busy with publicity things ! 
^ &name 's asking around too , so if we find someone else then it would prob be better to let you get on with running the acetates / fliers desk . 
^ but if you do end up selling tickets too , i think &name or &name are the people to ask about where to get them from ? 
^ thanks again , hope you 're all having a good week &smiley love &name

^ hi guys , thanks so much again for all you 're doing ! 
^ it 's been great seeing posters and fliers springing up all over the place &smiley just wondered whether you 're free to do another little favour- although do n't worry if not , as i know you 're both really busy ... 
^ will you be at bt this week ? 
^ as you know , we 're selling tickets- only neither &name , &name or i can be there ... so if you just happen to be there , and if it would n't be too much trouble , i wondered whether you might be able to help out ? ? ? 
^ but really do n't worry if not , i 'll just ask others &smiley &name , how are you feeling now ? 
^ i do hope and pray that you 're recovering quickly &smiley have good weeks , hope to see you soon ! 
^ love &name
