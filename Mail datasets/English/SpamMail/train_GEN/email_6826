^ " the &name college &name &name exists to help christians at &name get the most out of their time here , by helping people meet each other and feel part of a larger community ; through weekly meetings , small prayer groups and general friendship . "

^ &name the above might identify some secondary aims ( or , if read with the correct understanding , how we might aim to achieve the primary aim ) , my understanding was that our primary aim is not identified above .
