^ dear all , 
^ this is your chance to be involved in what will probably be the greatest thing you will ever be a part of in &name ( and beyond ! ) . 
^ after the success of " the greatest show on earth " in &num , preparations are getting underway for the next ball , in &num . 
^ why not get involved in making this the best &name &name ever ? 
^ everyone who has been to a &name &name will know what a great event they can be . 
^ anyone who has n't will find out soon enough what they 've been missing . 
^ organising it is a different experience altogether . 
^ the feeling of walking around the ball site at 2am , seeing people having one of the best nights of their lives , and knowing that you were behind it all is unforgettable . 
^ being involved could mean anything from planning and budgeting for a tasty selection of food for &num people , buying enough champagne , wine , beer and reef to make sure that , despite their best efforts , &name and it 's guests ca n't see it off , or putting together a programme of bands and djs for &num hours . 
^ anything and everything that happens at a mayball needs to be planned from scratch . 
^ it 's a big challenge but an amazing opportunity . 
^ this is , quite probably , your only chance to be involved in a project like this . 
^ we will be putting together a committee of about &num people to take responsibility for the different areas of the ball . 
^ so whatever you think you could contribute , let me know , and more importantly , apply . 
^ we will be holding interviews towards the end of next week and hopefully have a committee together in &num weeks time . 
^ we will be holding a brief meeting in the bar on this saturday night ( &num / &num ) at 8pm for anyone who wants to find out more information about the positions available and the work that being on the committee involves . 
^ there will be some members of last years committee available to talk to about their experiences - both good and bad . 
^ any questions at all , let me know . 
^ application forms will be available on saturday . 
^ if you 're interested in being involved let me know any i 'll do my best to answer all your questions . 
^ the deadline for applications will be next wednesday ( 14th may ) .
