^ &char complex literary analysis of the historic welcome poem ( written by his lordship ) by a worthy follower of the venerable &name . 
^ &name 
^ dear flat people , 
^ i was so overwhelmed by the depth of hidden feeling , knowledge and purpose in &name 's poem that i felt i really must pass on this exposition of it 
^ to my flat mates of joy , [ reference to this ( infinitesimal ) hypothetical temporal state of being on seeing &name . ] 
^ say i , &name oh boy ! 
^ [ origin unknown , possibly canadian . 
^ generally excepted as an exultation of glory to the male members of the flat . 
^ ( i.e. &name and &name ) this has been unsuccessfully disputed in recent years by followers of &name and &name . ] 
^ what fun we shall have as a &num ! 
^ [ &name approach to flat life , giving evidence to the view that dictators always start out like this . 
^ it is a little known fact that the term &num probably does not refer to the &num flat people , but may in fact be of anglo- canadian origin and mean group of &num slaves controlled by red-haired pseudo- deity . ] 
^ will we not be cooking [ earlier manuscripts substitute we and will , giving a more likely rendition of the text ] 
^ fried rice and looking [ delusional reference to the mythical idea that students eat &name . 
^ many treatises were written on this subject by the venerable &name &name . 
^ his authoritative writings still draw many followers . ] 
^ for chicken of suitable size ? 
^ [ reference to expensive organic chicken usually smaller and therefore more difficult to find . 
^ very popular with the revered flat people . ] 
^ till we next meet then , [ denotes anticipation of friendship , the author reveals his deep-felt need for companionship . 
^ linked with the frailty of human emotion syndrome as studied by &name of the &name &name medical research labs . ] 
^ &name , &name , &name and &name &name , [ here each of the author 's flat mates is personified as a well-known clock &num ) &name . 
^ an anagram of the v.g.a. clock ( virtual germ-free apartment ) . 
^ thought to pertain to the author 's ideal state of being for the coming year . 
^ &num ) &name the &name &name is often found in anthills . 
^ its source of power is unknown , but it appears to work reasonably accurately . 
^ it comes with a built- in television . 
^ &num ) &name . 
^ there is no such clock , thereby giving great support to the popular view that the original spelling was n2o . 
^ this would then correlate with the well known laughing clocks of eastern &name . 
^ ( n2o is the chemical symbol for nitrous oxide more commonly known as laughing gas . ) &num ) &name . 
^ likened to &name &name in &name , this shows the authors feelings regarding the permanency of &name , his unwavering tick-tock some authorities use this reference to introduce the deity of &name , but we refute that , giving &name the credit . ] 
^ i wish you the best of the prize . 
^ [ curiously , here the author appears to be wishing for his friends to enjoy his presence while he is absent . 
^ this seemingly contradictory statement actually makes perfect sense if the reader interprets the merit of the author 's presence inversely from that which is portrayed . 
^ however , scholars struggle over this version as it is generally thought his lordship was very well liked by his colleagues . 
^ a dilemma for the modern mind to puzzle over if ever there was one . 
^ the venerable &name &name put it down to grammatical errors , but this proved highly unpopular with the &name ( pro &name &name ) groups of his day , leading to his untimely martyrdom . ] 
^ what prize is this ? 
^ i hear you say , [ figurative language appertaining to the gift of friendship . 
^ fundamentalist followers of his lordship often claim that he could actually hear his friends questioning remarks over hundreds of miles . 
^ this cannot be refuted strongly enough as current opinion states that his lordship was definitely not divine . 
^ some may argue that early engravings of the renowned flat person glow with a radiance of their own , but we attribute this to their being discovered in close proximity to radioactive surroundings &name &name 's &name ] 
^ of which his lordship speaks today [ allusion to the means of communication employed by the author to deliver his poem . 
^ many beautiful words have been written on this proverbial verse of verses , highlighting the individuality of text . 
^ the appearance of living words are starkly contrasted by the citation of the author 's pseudo-title his lordship , denoting grim and lofty determination . 
^ however , the non-inclusion of capital letters in the name suggests a glimmer of recognition that mortality may have reached the author . 
^ death comes to all . ] 
^ why , tis living with me , of course ! 
^ [ false egoism , of which the author is prone . 
^ also can be interpreted that the gift of friendship is living inside the author , or , for that matter , any gift . 
^ could this possibly be another hidden allusion to the author 's brevity of existence ? 
^ the venerable &name &name was of that opinion . ] 
^ ( &name &name , &name ! ) [ probably the author 's original comments . 
^ these words have become timelessly enshrined as the pro &name &name benediction . 
^ devotees squawk loudly while chanting in solemn canadian monotones &name &name , &name many times over . 
^ this practice is outlawed in &num states due to the subtle machinations of the venerable &name &name &name group . 
^ these worthy individuals have taken it upon themselves to ensure the welcome poem is passed down through the generations in all purity and with the highest appreciation of purpose . ]
