^ &name &name . 
^ all college accomodation is self catering . 
^ each house of approx &num students has a kitchen . 
^ each kitchen is provided with an oven with electric hobb , a fridge and a microwave as well as cupboard space . 
^ no cooking utensils , saucepans or crockery are provided . 
^ we may , of course , also choose to eat in college if we prefer . 
^ &name &name has about &num graduate rooms this year and just over &num next year . 
^ this accomodates about half of our fee paying graduates but in addition we have about &num graduates who are no longer paying fees for &num reason or another ( gap years , overseas research , 4th year grads with no funding) . 
^ rooms are assigned preferentially to incoming graduate students in their first year but some students do stay in college accomodation longer . 
^ none of our graduates are guaranteed accomodation for any year of their course and we have no married accomodation . 
^ &name this helps - could you forward this info to &name and / or the person who asked for it ?

^ hi , 
^ we 're in discussions with college at the moment about accommodation and i wonder if you can tell me a little about the provision for your postgrads . 
^ i 'd like to know if your grads get self-catering facilities - what percentage of your students ? 
^ what type of facilities ? 
^ i 'd also like to know whether your 4th year postgrads are given accomodation ( either those on a an extended phd programme , or those who did a &num year &name before going on to a &num year phd for example) . 
^ any information gratefully received ! 
^ &name ( &email ) &name &name president
