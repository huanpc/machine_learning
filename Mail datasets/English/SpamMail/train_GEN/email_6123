^ obviously if we are going to drive to northcourt and park there we will need to agree an exact time for you to open the gates ? 
^ probably best if we do drive down before chapel though because it saves a lot of time afterwards and we do n't want to be late home .

^ i have spoken to &name and arranged that we will come up after lunch to see them and exchange presents , then we can meet you when you are free ; obviously if we are going to drive to northcourt and park there we will need to agree an exact time for you to open the gates ? 
^ probably best if we do drive down before chapel though because it saves a lot of time afterwards and we do n't want to be late home . 
^ let us know what you think would be the best arrangement . 
^ mum 
^ .. well , it _is_ advent this time , at least ! 
^ i spoke to the &name on sunday about next sunday and he said that he 'd be happy if wanted for you to park in their driveway to avoid breaking the two-hour waiting rule , but he added that there should n't be a problem if you park in &name court for that time , provided you put a notice in the windscreen saying you were in chapel for the &name service . 
^ the service starts at &name and i wo n't be back in &name ( from the &name students " houseparty ) until 
^ &num 30pm , so arriving between these times would probably be a good idea ! 
^ &name all is well at home 
^ see you sunday 
^ love
