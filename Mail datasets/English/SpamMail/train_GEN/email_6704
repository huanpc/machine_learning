^ if &name definitely ca n't find a cheaper offer i think he has to go ahead with it ; alternatively , could &name &name be possibly asked very nicely if he would not consider playing on the chamber organ at &name 's? ? ? ? ? 
^ i do n't think we will be able to put student prices up - the tickets have already been printed . 
^ i think , as you said , we can take the extra money from ticket sales and safety net . 
^ what about increasing the number of adult and concession tickets so that the figures are back to those planned before &name 's kindly agreed to not charge us for their chapel ? 
^ &name , would it be possible for me to chat to you about any budget changes sometime this week ( during a ticket-selling session ) in case &char accidently miss something ?

^ hi &name and &name , &name all 's well with you ? 
^ &name rang this morning- he 's been doing his best to find a good deal for the chamber organ , the best he can find is : 
^ &pound; &num ( inc &name ) + they 'll bring to the chapel by &num when final rehearsals start + they 'll tune it and make sure everything 's ok during the day ( &char necessary- they ca n't just drop it off ! ) + they 'll remove it at the end of the concert . 
^ now , as you can see , this is quite a bit more than what was allowed in the budget- these are my thoughts ... 
^ &num ) only &num vocal score needs to be bought for soloists &num &pound; &num , say &pound; &num this leaves &pound; &num from what we allowed for that &num ) plus &pound; &num allocated to instrument hire &num ) we now have to pay expenses for &num people from &name &name reckons just &pound; &num each , as he 's pretty sure ( and will check ! ) they 'll be staying with friends in &name so we 'll have to take &pound; &num from performers " expenses &num ) i think this gives us &pound; &num we can safely use ... 
^ &num ) there 's another &pound; &num in admin charges which we could use some of ... 
^ &num ) then perhaps we could use &pound; &num from our safety net ? ? ? 
^ &num ) if &num more student tickets are sold than what we allowed for in the budget , that would make up the above amount , if that looks better than using the safety net ? 
^ ( we could use some mixture of points &num ) &smiley as a very last resort , we could increase student ticket prices by 50p , giving us an extra &pound; &num for &num students ... since posters are n't ready yet anyway ... &name really does n't see an alternative- what do you think ? 
^ &name needs to know within the next couple of days , so he can confirm arrangements- so please could you let me know what you think of the above ? 
^ take care , see you tomorrow ? 
^ love &name
