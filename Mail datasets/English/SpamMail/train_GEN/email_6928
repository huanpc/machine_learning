^ &name , i have looked at your software and it is very good . 
^ i like your &name software as well . 
^ i have a comment on the selfview software that i would like to see in a new version . 
^ can you make it work work with &name files . 
^ that would be really great , because most of our customers do n't use msword so it would be nice to send them an exe file of our document .
