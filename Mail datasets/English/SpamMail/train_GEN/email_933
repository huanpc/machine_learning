^ good evening . 
^ i thank you for your philosophical email . 
^ i believe i exist . 
^ an experiment : look at yourself in a mirror , stare deep into your eyes and think of nothing in particular . 
^ when i do this sometimes i think i am not myself . 
^ i do not feel like myself . 
^ it is very odd . 
^ does this ever happen to you . 
^ my dinner is now served , so i shall go and eat ... 
^ ... i have eaten . 
^ but i am still hungry . 
^ that is the way of life . 
^ and there was no pudding left over ... for breakfast .
