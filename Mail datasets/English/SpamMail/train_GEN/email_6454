^ hi 
^ hope you managed to get some sleep tonight before the int brek ... sorry to have kept you up later tonight and to have taken up more of your time . 
^ just a few verses for you : 
^ 'do not let your hearts be troubled . 
^ trust in &name ; trust also in me " &name &num : &num 
^ " but our citizenship is in heaven . 
^ and we eagerly await a saviour from there , the &name &name &name , who , by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control , will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body . " &name &num : &num , &num 
^ " &name has said , " never will i leave you ; never will i forsake you '' &name &num : &num 
^ " praise be to the &name and father of our &name &name &name ! 
^ in his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of &name &name from the dead , and into an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade - kept in heaven for you , who throuth faith are shielded by &name 's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time . 
^ in this you greatly rejoice , though now for a little while you may have had to suffer frief in all kinds of trials . 
^ these come so that your faith - of greater worth than gold , which perishes even though refined by fire - may be proven genuine and may result in praise glory and honour when &name &name is revealed . " &num &name &num : &num 
^ " in keeping with his promise , we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth , the home of righteousness " &num &name &num : &num 
^ &name &num : &num - &num 
^ &name &num : &num 
^ " &name remembered &name ; he listened to her " &name &num : &num [ slightly construed and to be taken in isolation , but i thought you 'd like it anyway &smiley psalm &num and countless others show &name does listen to us ] 
^ &name &num : &num 
^ " both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family . 
^ so &name is not ashamed to call them brothers " &name &num : &num 
^ " and surely i am with you always , to the very end of the age " &name 
^ 28: &num 
^ take care , 
^ love
