^ hi &name , 
^ i 've been waiting to answer these questions of yours until i had fairly solid answers . 
^ to " &char ) " ... i have n't made much progress towards developing my art other than cleaning out my studio in preparation , because " &char ) " , &name ( the infamous " rafting lady " ) and i have really hit it off &smiley it 's far too early to make predictions but we both agree &name is in this and we have further business of the heart to do together . 
^ &name ! 
^ meanwhile , world events have pretty much taken over here in the states . 
^ &name the clock " news " and patriotic talk filling the air . 
^ i 'm praying the &name will help us to see the " log in our own eye " first . 
^ we 'll see . 
^ as far as whether or not you 're novel is ready for submission , my advice is always to ask not whether you 're happy with it , but is the book " happy " . 
^ do you catch my meaning here ? 
^ if so , then i would ask an expert , have a 'reader " of such material read it and tell you what they think . 
^ i 'm afraid i would n't be qualified ! 
^ okay , my very best to you and the family . 
^ and , it feels a little funny asking this , but appropriate i think , please pray for our leaders if you will . 
^ they 've got a terrible job ahead . 
^ thanks &name . 
^ glad you 're enjoying your guitar . 
^ i 'll keep you posted on all . 
^ &name 
^ dear &name , 
^ i 've been wondering about &num things . ... &char ) your art - what ave you decided to do re the exhibition suggestion ? 
^ any furthur steps taken ? 
^ and &char ) any news from the lady you met on the rafting trip ? 
^ you asked about my guitar ... well , it 's getting better , slowly . 
^ i 'm just starting to branch out into the scary world of hard chords ... &name ! 
^ since i left you , i 've spent some time working on my novel , and am starting to entertain faint hopes of getting it published . 
^ dad is very pessimistic about this , saying that it is very unlikely , and only a fraction of books ever get published ( i wonder how some do ... ) but what do you think ? 
^ it is n't ready yet , but i believe that i 'm now writing well enough , well at least better than i was before , and i 'm working my way through the book again . 
^ how did you get &name 's dream published ? 
^ i 'm working on a painting at the moment of a conductor , which is really cool . 
^ it is very dark , except for the man 's face , white shirt under his d-j and hands , lit up by the stage lights . 
^ anyway , i 'm having fun with it . 
^ &name all is well , 
^ &name
