^ choice in colleges teh &num next door to &name 's, i dont know whether that is a good way to do it or not , i just figured that if you were randomly going to go to something you might be more tempted if it were next door than if it were &num minutes away - &char dunno if that is true tho ... any better ideas as to how to discriminate ?

^ ok - seems reasonable enough .

^ though she 'll probably refer it onto &name who has all the info & contacts , so it might be a couple of days . 
^ there is always the &name to try & catch them at .
