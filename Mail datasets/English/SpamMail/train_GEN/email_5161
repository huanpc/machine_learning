^ &name 
^ usually we go to lunch at a nearby sandwich bar after the seminar ( around &num ) , with individual meetings afterwards until mid-afternoon . 
^ assuming you come down on wednesday , can you leave conveniently around 
^ 3: &num or &num : &num ? 
^ alternatively you could see people on thursday morning before the seminar , and leave after lunch . 
^ what equipment will you need for the talk ? 
^ looking forward to your visit

^ hi &name , 
^ &name &name has invited me to stay the night either before or after my seminar next week - does it make any difference from your ( pl ) perspective which night i stay ? 
^ e.g. meeting people ? 
^ my preferred option would probably be to come down on &name , since otherwise i 'd have to fight the rush hour to get there in good time for &num : &num , but that 's only a slight preference .
