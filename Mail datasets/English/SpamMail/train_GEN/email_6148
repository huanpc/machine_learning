^ hi &name , thanks for letting me know about your updated program . 
^ i will not be using &name &name until it 's out of the beta phase . 
^ do you think your newer version would be of use to me if i 'm still using innosetup &num ? 
^ i have version &num of your program . 
^ thanks again for making such a wonderful application , christian 
^ you can get an updated version of &name icon replacer at : &website / which integrates into &name 3.0.2-dev ( source code also available ) and hence should resolved some of your complaints &smiley

^ okay let me start by saying these program names are far too similar : ) . 
^ just remember one has innosetup in the title : ) . 
^ both : 
^ - replace the icon of .exe files written in something other than delphi or innosetup . 
^ - propagate transparency from an icon data source . 
^ replace icon 
^ - does n't support .exes or dlls , only .ico 
^ - replace icon allows you to create or not create a backup of your .exe . 
^ i can always just recompile so it 's not that big of a deal . 
^ the actual program does n't divulge this syntax , but " &char " will prevent it from creating &website ) 
^ - is a console application , while this is really annoying for &num time use , because you have to learn the syntax , it 's wonderful for repeated use . 
^ for example you can create a shortcut that does all the work for you or maybe a batch file that takes the compiled .exe , adds the icon , and re-compiles an updated innosetup package 
^ innosetup icon replacer 
^ - is n't a console application , &name it has a &name ( graphical user interface ) 
^ - allows you to specify which file within an .exe , or dll you want to use 
^ - it also lists the icon number within the .exe or dll file , this is helpful if you 're going to make a file association for &num or more document formats you 'll need to specify which file within the .exe will be used in the registry : [ &name ] root : &name ; &name : " 4square.documentdefaulticon " ; &name : string ; &website , 1' &smiley 
^ - is hard to automate , and does n't remember the paths to your last job 
^ here are the paths to download these wonderful free applictions : 
^ if anyone is familiar with the other &num programs &name lists &name , and resource &name please post similar comments
