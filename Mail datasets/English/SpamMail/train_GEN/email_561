^ dear &name , 
^ " &name are &num things " 
^ - i prefer the chocolate kind , although i have little acquaintance with either . 
^ " they scruff their snouts along the ground trying to find them , it 's called truffling . " 
^ - you seem to be rather an authority on pigs . 
^ " i will come visit you , whenever i get my first invite ! " 
^ - you 're most welcome to come and see me anytime . 
^ i will be very pleased to see you , and you do n't need an invite ! 
^ but if you 're not busy on tuesday sometime then you have an invite . 
^ only &num more days of work left . 
^ marvellous ! 
^ i wonder what i shall do this evening . 
^ &name , perhaps i 'll begin getting my belongings together for going back to &name . 
^ really looking forward to seeing you again . 
^ love &name
