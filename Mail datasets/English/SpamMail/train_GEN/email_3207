^ i 'll think about some ideas for some bible study for you for sunday . ^ i 'm grateful for your prayers and please know of your prayers for you . ^ this morning at  ame slot we asked the folks at  ame  ame to be praying for you also . ^ thanks for the phone number , and i think it would be good to talk at some point before the weekend . ^ warm regards and every blessing . ^  ame <text_embedded> ^ hi  ame ^ just wanted to check that you were still fine to come on the houseparty next weekend . ^ as far as i know we 're all " packed " and ready to go (  ame 's gone away this weekend though so i 'll have to check ! ) . ^ we 'll be sending out an instruction sheet later in the week about where we 're meeting up and suchlike . ^ we 're leaving about  um on friday and i know you 'll be wanting to come back from  ame on saturday afternoon - do you know how you want to do that ? ^ you 'll need a sleeping bag or something similar since linen is not provided ( or at least we 'd have had to pay a lot more ! ) ^  ame was supposed to be writing to you with details of the weekend but i understand he has n't! ^ so with regard to the structure : friday night , if you 'd like to introduce yourself and maybe tell us some stories or something ! ^ we 'll keep that evening fairly casual and informal , allow people to relax . ^ then saturday morning we 'll have  um sessions with a coffee break in between for you to do with as you please . ^ then usually we try and keep the afternoon fairly free for football and possibly a " wide game " so you could either leave after lunch or stay for a little while - your choice . ^ does that sound okay ? ^ sunday morning we 'll do our best to amuse ourselves and maybe have a bible study or something - we 're going to ask someone to do that . ^ any suggestions for a passage to do would be appreciated , based on what you decide to speak on . ^ on that note ... did you have any ideas about what you 'd like to speak about ? ^ i ca n't remember if we discussed it before . ^ i wondered about whether we could do something about who we are in  ame , or about what it means to be a servant , any suggestions ? ^ we 've been studying  um  ame this term in our bible studies so it 's been interesting seeing what  ame says about obeying masters and husbands and so on . ^ i 'll talk to  ame and get back to you if we have any thoughts about this . ^ do you have a phone number we could contact you on ? ^ our flat number is  um  um  um if you have any questions . ^ i 'm sure i 've missed out something ! ^ see you friday - love  ame </text_embedded></text_embedded></text_embedded></message_body></message>
