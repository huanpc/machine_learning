^ hi ! 
^ dad called me today and let me have your email address - he says that things are going ok with you and that you are settling in. that 's great ... 
^ life here in a very wet and soggy &name ( after today 's gales ) is busy as ever - i ca n't quite believe that i 'm in my 11th year at my school . 
^ any way hope that you are still surviving and making the most of this time - looking back i think i 'd have done things differently if i was to have my time at college again - so enjoy it ! ! 
^ lots of love &name and &name
