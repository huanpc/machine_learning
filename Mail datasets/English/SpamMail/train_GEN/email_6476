^ really sorry to you both for not getting back to you about this sooner . 
^ i think i had better decline for time reasons - i may be loafing around with nothing to do , like this term , but on the other hand i have a feeling that next term is designed to be busy enough to compensate for my recent laziness .

^ hi &name , how are you ? 
^ regretting not doing physics any more ? 
^ &smiley just wondering whether you 'd come to any conclusions about rehearsal venue fixing ?
