^ even if there is some essence of a point in this related to usability , it is far from the biggest of usability problems in &name .

^ while &char agree that the naming issue is not a large issue , nor even really related to usability at all , &char responded because i do n't believe that telling people to basically shut up is the best way to foster a community , nor is ignoring those who put an effort out there very helpful either . 
^ there is so much criticism out there right now about how &name developers do n't care about users or feedback they receive . 
^ this viewpoint is largely fostered , &name , by " rtfm' -like responses , or simply no response whatsoever . 
^ and seeing as there already were responses and discussion , i thought it may be useful to offer positive insight into the matter rather than to just tell everyone to shut up . 
^ i did manage to to work in a few hints that it really was n't a usability issue along the way . 
^ i hope that helps you understand why &char replied .

^ btw , ( and to steer this somewhere useful ) : were n't you working on a usability report on the printer manager ? 
^ if so , did you manage to post it somewhere ? 
^ i do n't seem to have it in my little collection of reports )
