^ just to let you all know that i 've managed to get a nurse from an eating disorders clinic in &name to come and do a talk on friday 7th &name . 
^ the talk will be open to all students of the uni and will be aimed more at the friends of people with eating disorders and those who have positions such as welfare officers or womens " officers . 
^ i have heard that this nurse is fantastic and it would be so nice if we could get a large audience together to create a good atmosphere - so please , if you can make it come along . 
^ it 'll be in the evening but i will send a more detailed e-mail nearer to the time ... just wanted to get you all early so you 'll have no excuse but to come ! ! ! 
^ thanks &name &name college welfare officer
