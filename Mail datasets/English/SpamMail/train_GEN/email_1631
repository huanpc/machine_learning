" and 'do you have to sign a form to become a christian ? " joking aside though , i enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . ^ consequently i enjoyed a much more respectable  um or  um hours sleep each night . ^ more importantly , one of the children made a commitment to  ame , which was wonderful . ^ last tuesday evening we all played  ame outside in the grounds of the country house we stayed in.  um had to dress up as a  ame , and this i did with some relish . ^ i also saw  ame  ame , who seemed well . ^ she was a leader at the camp too . ^ yesterday evening i went to a concert in  ame . ^ the  ame  ame philharmonic orchestra was playing . ^ this afternoon i 've been with my family to  ame - a nearby country house . ^ it is very warm today and i like it . ^ we had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . ^ tomorrow morning i begin my new job for  um weeks . ^ i will be working from  um o' clock until  um in the lab , and i am quite looking forward to it although i hope it will not be too boring . ^ very best wishes , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
