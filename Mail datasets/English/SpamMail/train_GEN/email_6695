^ the suggestion you made is not an option to me , because of the following reasons : 
^ &num ) &name is a 16-bit program , because it has to support ms-dos . 
^ because of this i do not have programming support for checking registry keys . 
^ &num ) with your suggested method if i have a &name zip file i need another 2gb to create a &name &name file . 
^ this way i need &name . 
^ if i had a &name stub file i could create a &name &name file at once with only &name . 
^ no double space needed ! 
^ &num ) because i do not know the format of the stub , like you said , i do not want to get involved with that . 
^ thats why i wondered if your program could create / save the &name stub file , without the &name &name data , but including the data section which specifies parameters such as the window caption , extraction path etc. if your program could save this suggested stub file , this file could be placed in front of a normal zip file and we should have a working 32-bit &name &name file . 
^ at least i think so ? 
^ so what i would like to see in your program is an option to only save the stub file including the data section , but without any &name data . 
^ is this possible ? 
^ i am going to implement an option in my program to let the user specify this created &name stub file which is going to be placed in front of a normal &name file and they should have a working &name &name file with all the options they specified in your program . 
^ hope you can work this out ?

^ i 'm sorry about the delay in getting back to you , but i have not had time recently to provide technical support for &name &name and hence your e-mail has been in a queue .

^ as the author of &name i was looking for a good &name &name stub and found yours to be the best around . 
^ i would like to implement an option in ldzip to create a &name &name file , and would like to give the user the possibility to specify the &name stub file . 
^ so , it would be really great if your &name &name had the possibility of only saving the &name stub file . 
^ could you implement this feature in a next release of &name &name ?

^ the tricky thing about this is that after the stub comes a data section which specifies parameters such as the window caption , extraction path etc. and these data sections are in a format unique to a particular stub . 
^ therefore to support a variety of stubs you would need to know the format of this data to create the &name . 
^ surely a better method would be to detect if &name &name is installed ( see &name variable in &name &name &name ) and call &name to create the &name ? 
^ let me know what you think and i 'll quite happily discuss this further with you .
