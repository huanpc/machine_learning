^ - do you have any preference as to whether or not the code is listed in appendices ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ we 'd prefer that you do n't give code - but do make sure that your directories are readable by us when you hand-in . 
^ the exception is that if there 's some algorithm you 're especially proud of and are writing up in detail , feel free to give pseudo-code ( preferred ) or fragments of actual code to make the algorithm clear

^ - do you have any preference as to whether single or double-sided printing is used ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ normally double-sided , but it so happens that we 're going to have to photocopy some or all of the marked practicals this year , so anything you can do to make this easier would be appreciated . 
^ single-sided with a binding or staple that can easily be removed would help . 
^ the same applies to the essays . 
^ also , in response to a couple of questions , you do not have to get high &name to get good marks on the practical .
