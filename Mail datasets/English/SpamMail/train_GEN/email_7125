^ dear &name , 
^ hello ! ! 
^ i have n't spoken to you for ages ! 
^ how are you ? 
^ having a good holiday so far ? 
^ hope you 're managing to have a good rest and do n't have too much work ... 
^ i wanted to say thank you for my birthday present ... sorry it 's so late ! 
^ i did write a note that went to &name and back several times , but never quite made it as far as you ! 
^ sorry &smiley but thanks very much - the choclate was yummy and has all gone , the notebook is very pretty and will be used soon , and the pen has already been very useful ! 
^ so thanks . 
^ well i 'm well , enjoying being on holiday and not having too much to do . 
^ i 'm aware i have quite a bit of revision to do at some point but it 's nice not to have any deadlines that seem too immediate for the moment ! 
^ the end of term was manic as usual , what with lab reports and computing practicals to be done , but it 's all good fun . 
^ i 'm still enjoying physics so that 's good &smiley &name compsci is still behaving itself for you . 
^ well i 'd better go i think . 
^ have a lovely holiday though and a happy &name . 
^ &name
