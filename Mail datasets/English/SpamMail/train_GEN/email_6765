^ hi all ... 
^ i know at the &name everyone 's got lots to do to meet our final deliverables . 
^ but please spare some time over this as how we present our project is of vital importance . 
^ i have drafted a script of the final presentation . 
^ i believe we must know exactly what to say , memorise it but then deliver it in an " unrehearsed " and natural way . 
^ i think it 's best for &num people to present it . 
^ it 's important to have different voices to constantly refresh the attention of the audience . 
^ i 'd like to nominate myself and &name to do the presentation as we both have had extensive experience before . 
^ the colour codes on the draft shows how the voices are alternated . 
^ there are details that i have glossed over , my priority is to draft out at least an outline , and i 'd like to see if you guys approve of my approach or not . 
^ as it stands , the script takes around &num to &num minutes to read out . 
^ but there are details yet to be added . 
^ of course it will need to be rephrased and restructured extensively later . 
^ i have also included suggestions for slide contents ( we are allowed only &num slides ) . 
^ please could you all give me some feedback by monday ? 
^ ideally i 'd like to present a draft version to &name &name on wednesday , &name he has always shown a lot of interest in our presentation since reivew meeting &num . 
^ i think it would be unwise not to produce anything on wednesday despite the fact it 's not specified explicitly as a deliverable . 
^ i would be very grateful if you guys would give me some critical comments , tell me if you think something will work or not . 
^ thanks a lot ...

^ [ slide &num &name general : &name logo , distributed probabilistic factorization of large integers . ] 
^ ladies , gentlemen , members of the faculty and distinguished guests , welcome to &name 
^ &name . 
^ our accomplished mission is a software program that will factorise an arbitrary integer utilising probabilistic algorithms and distributed computing methods . 
^ [ slide &num : flow diagram of the system , including names of the algorithms used , how the system is distributed ] 
^ it is an academically impressive and challenging problem , to achieve our goal we employed some of the most leading edge algorithms and tools . 
^ ( discussion of the various algorithms , how they are optimized in our system . 
^ &num minutes ) 
^ but why ? 
^ you may ask , should it interest you ? 
^ how ? 
^ does it affect your life ? 
^ [ slide &num : applications of factorization in 3freal3f life ] 
^ well , we all expect our bank details , telephone connections and online transactions to be secure and confidential , but most of us take for granted the fact that primality factorization plays an irreplaceable role in many of the underlying security procedures . 
^ you may all be aware that the factorization of large numbers is a very difficult problem . 
^ ( some illustrations required here , eg. it takes typically bla amount of time to factorise a number of bla length ) modern cryptography and security systems exploit the fact that large integers cannot be easily factorised . 
^ on a national scale , security systems based on primality factorization are extensively used by governments . 
^ for example , the &name government has been using &num such system -- the &name &name technology to protect its most sensitive information for nearly &num years . 
^ [ slide &num : how our project may be used in a practical sense ] 
^ ( discussion of how our project maybe used in a topical context &num min ) 
^ admittedly , our project is a somewhat primitive realization of this ambitious plan . 
^ the factorisation is only optimised for integers up to &num hundred decimal digits. ( other constraints , eg on the distribution front and tools available to us ) 
^ however given the time limit of just &num week , we are proud of our achievements . 
^ our accomplishment is driven by a genuine interest in the subject , a strong desire to succeed and a well managed and united work force . 
^ the impending war on &name , the increasingly sophisticated nature of global terrorist organizations are no doubt haunting issues at the back of everybody3fs mind . 
^ whilst we leave strategic decisions in the hands of our political leaders , as scientists , we can make significant contributions to the underlying operations that govern all decision makings . 
^ ( invite audience to join &name &name by downloading our client package ! ) 
^ as scientists , war and peace is very much part of our responsibility . 
^ as scientists , war and peace is our prime concern . 
^ thank you .
