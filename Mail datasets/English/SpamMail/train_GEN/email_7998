^ dear all , 
^ it seems that almost all of you are interested ... but not before the exams . 
^ this is understood and respected . 
^ myself , as someone graduating next year and not having any projects / dissertations to complete , i was perhaps a bit too hurrayoptimistic ... 
^ therefore , as agreed , the barn &name &name has been postponed " till * after * the exams . 
^ we 'll finalize the dates once we actually know when the exams are ( i know when mine are ! ) and who wants to come . 
^ care will be taken to avoid clashes between the trip and important events ( e.g. graduation , &name &name , etc &smiley 
^ enjoy your holidays ! 
^ &name ( on behalf of &name , too ; but he is graduating this year and he needs to do the catam , ha ha ! ) 
^ ps we still want to hear from you how much you want to come and all ...
