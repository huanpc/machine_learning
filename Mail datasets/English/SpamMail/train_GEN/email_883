^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for the freeserve number . 
^ unfortunately i needed it in order to see if i could connect to the internet , so i could n't actually receive it via e-mail until that nasty virus was eradicated . 
^ &name &name is now much better . 
^ i got a nice little program from my &name company 's site on the internet which found and destroyed the virus . 
^ excellent . 
^ anyway , i have now finished work ! 
^ i am very happy . 
^ this morning i had such a lovely lazy time . 
^ are you anxious to get back to &name tomorrow ? 
^ i guess you 'll be there by the time you read this . 
^ hope you are settling in well in your new room . 
^ i shall be in &name briefly on monday around midday to drop of all me stuff , then my mum is taking me to &name to get material for my duvet ( and bin ) cover .
