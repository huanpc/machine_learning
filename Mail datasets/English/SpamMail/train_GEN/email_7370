^ thank you for the birthday present - you said it would n't be a surprise but it certainly was ! 
^ i had a fair sprinkling of cards and presents including a card with a badge on that says " forever young " which the family seem to think is a great joke . 
^ and of course a cake from granny . 
^ day just spent in office and at &name meeting - where &name &name asked after you . 
^ saw &name , who is really very unwell . 
^ auntie &name has been asking for your address . 
^ i assume you will put it at the top of your letter to her , but if it is not imminent i can pass it on . 
^ do we just put room &name and the college address ? 
^ i have mail to send on . 
^ love , mum
