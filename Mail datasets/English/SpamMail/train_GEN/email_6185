^ hi &name ! 
^ i am sorry i still have your towel , but forgot to give it back to you before leaving . 
^ i have now arrived in &name , but i promise you will get it back by monday . 
^ thanks very much for your offer to swap rooms again . 
^ i can only repeat myself , but i thought that was very kind . 
^ the reason why i am writing is because i would like to ask you for a favour . 
^ we have a food fair on friday as you know and the &name society is organising the drinks from college , which they ca n't give back the same night ( leftovers , i mean ) . 
^ they therefore would like to store them somewhere in college , my room is not available , since i am not there . 
^ would you mind if they left them in your room for &num night ? 
^ are you going to be in ? 
^ it would be great if they could , but if you mind or are not in at about &num p.m. ish on friday night , then that 's fine . 
^ could you please let me and &name ( &email ) know whether leaving unopened drinks in your room would be ok . 
^ if not , i will hopefully find someone else who lives in college . 
^ thank you very much for your help , &name
