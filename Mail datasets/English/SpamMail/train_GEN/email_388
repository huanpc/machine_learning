^ dear &name , 
^ hi . 
^ it was great to see you and everyone else in &name . 
^ now , thanks for your e-mail regarding money . 
^ i agree that we ought to begin with &pound; &num each in the account and take it from there . 
^ also , yes , i do want to get fat . 
^ unfortunately it never works . 
^ oh well , some people would n't be complaining . 
^ by the way , would you mind sending me a copy of that list of items which you were hurriedly scribbling down at our flat meeting ? 
^ also , do you know when all the flat birthdays are ? 
^ incidentally , we never got around to discussing prayer and bible study as an integral part of flat life . 
^ perhaps we should ? 
^ am i correct in assuming that we are taking the following rooms ? 
^ &num &name , &num &name , &num &name , &num &name , &num &name . 
^ if not , please tell me . 
^ i am able to bring &num pull-cords for the lights in the bathroom and toilet . 
^ i hope this is agreeable . 
^ the current &num are forbidden by department of environmental health legislation . 
^ and no , before you ask , i did n't check . 
^ oh , i am looking forward to living in this flat . 
^ do you have any ideas for the name which should appear on our cheque book ? 
^ ( it 's top priority decisions like these which we need to sort out immediately . ) did we definitely decide the stuffed moose 's head was impossible ? 
^ i think it would look imposing . 
^ please write me an interesting reply . 
^ thanks , 
^ &name 
^ &name i have absolutely no desire to become the youngest ever chief executive of &name inc. i am a chemist .
