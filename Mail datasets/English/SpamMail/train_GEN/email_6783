^ &name , 
^ i have created an self extracting &name file and after extraction it has to run a special command which i have defined in the &name extraction option . 
^ the problem i am having is it works in windows &num &name and when i try to run same software it does n't run on &name &num and &name &name . 
^ the error message was " could not able to open file " . 
^ well i think i know the problem . 
^ while making &name file with &name , i had selected as %temp% as my default archive extraction folder . 
^ in &name &num it works because we have c : windowstemp folder but in &name we do n't have that folder and on &name &name also it does n't work even though we have this folder . 
^ so my question is can we create our own folder using &name software so that we can extract the software and run the application from there and delete later on ? 
^ if yes can you please provide me the steps to do this . 
^ any help would be appreciated . 
^ best &name
