^ hey everyone- 
^ thanks to everyone ( myself not included ) who turned up on saturday . 
^ we beat &name &num &num to go &num in the league and earn promotion into the top division for next year . 
^ cuppers will probably be held early in may week . 
^ am hoping it 's * not * tuesday morning &smiley 
^ we have a good shot to make it to the final ( would say we have a good shot to win it , but &name &char is stacked with blues players ) . 
^ still , i think we could give them a good match . 
^ we should try to play a few times before cuppers . 
^ maybe this wednesday evening if the weather holds ? 
^ - &name
