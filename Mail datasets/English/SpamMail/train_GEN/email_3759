^ hey &name , 
^ hope you 're ok and enjoying the last week of the holidays ! 
^ i 'm praying for you and the whole funding thing . 
^ likewise , i have a prayer request ... 
^ i applied ( very last minute ) to do a &name in primary education at &name &name . 
^ when i sent off my application there were still interview spaces available . 
^ however , the &name ( agency who process all &name applications ) took ages to forward my application ( no idea why ! ) , and consequently all interview places have been filled and the &name will not forward my application to &name &name as they say they are full . 
^ so annoying ! ! 
^ it is something i really want to do ( i 've had the idea of teaching etc for a while , and then failing with the management things , and work experience these holidays , have convinced me to go for it ) and i really want to go to &name &name as &name will be there and i ca n't face not seeing him only here and there for a year . 
^ would be silly ! 
^ anyway , having told you all that , there is the remotest possibility that i could still get an interview ( very slim chance mind ) as i have contacted the senior admissions tutor and pleaded my case . 
^ i 'm awaiting his response . 
^ please pray that whatever decision he makes i would accept and not be angry at &name about ( oh , it 's so tempting ! ) . 
^ well , there you go ! 
^ i hope work / revision is going ok for you and you are not being distracted from it too much by worries about the future . 
^ i am just trying to accept the inevitable ( that i 'll have nothing sorted before my exams ) and attempting to buckle down to work . 
^ i 've got quite a bit of preparatory stuff done , so am feeling relatively happy about it all . 
^ i 'm back off to &name tomorrow ! ! 
^ are you back on sunday ? 
^ see you then , bye for now , love &name 
^ chat with friends online , try &name &name : &website
