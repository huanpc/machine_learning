^ and especially for * &name cake * . 
^ if some of you missed it , do n't worry , as the official celebrations have been postponed until the 26th of april &smiley 
^ the subject matter of this e-mail is , however , different . 
^ most of you probably have heard of one of the ideas others had regarding " getting away " to somewhere in the &name . 
^ there have been some more concrete arrangements made and we 're pleased to announce 
^ * * * the barn extravaganza * * * or : what does this bloody country has to offer ? 
^ motto : " this country is a piece of &char * * &char and the people are stupid " &char ) 
^ &name &name 
^ &char ) apologies to the english &num among us ; this was a somewhat over-emotional response of &name to the lack of peach and apple juice in &name 's . 
^ i will let you be relieved by saying that now is possible to get peach and apple juice in &char 's - obviously , not quite that of bosnian standards . 
^ in short , this is a symbol of all our foreigners " prejudices and complaints about &name . 
^ just recall me from the first year ( &name ! ) and you 'll know what i 'm talking about &smiley

^ i have to see that ... ) sleeping in pre-booked ))camping barns ( ( . 
^ &name barns are often described as " stone tents " - they are like basically places where you can sleep as if you were camping but with the benefit of no need for the actual tent . 
^ and , man , they 're cheap - &num &name person 
^-1 night 
^-1 . 
^ for more info : &website 
^ the idea is a bit more developed than it sounds , based on a easy-medium walk from &name &name " &name walking &name " ( thank you , borders!) . 
^ it promises to be interesting , cheap and relaxing holiday before full-time ploughing into the hardship of &name / &name &name . 
^ and perhaps one of the last chances to be together before ... * sob * ... * smrc * ... i just ca n't type it out .
