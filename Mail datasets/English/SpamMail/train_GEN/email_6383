^ system integration and testing the final task is to piece the whole system together , test it and ensure that it is adequately documented . 
^ the user manual should be written throughout the project , as the design emerges , but will need to be polished at the end of the project . 
^ the project manager must submit a final report at the final group meeting , which should describe the project 's successes and failures , elaborate on any lessons learned , and include a summary of the work undertaken by different team members in completing the system . 
^ it is perfectly reasonable for an individual member not to have written any code but to have worked specifically as a librarian or on documentation or testing as long as this was agreed with the other group members and is reported in the delivery document . 
^ personal report each group member must also submit a brief personal report for the final review meeting giving details of their individual contribution to the project . 
^ this should include a representative part of their contribution which might be program code or documentation , project management logs or minutes of meetings as appropriate . 
^ it should also give a summary assessment of the contributions made by the other members of the group . 
^ the group and the personal reports will be retained by the overseer and forwarded directly to the examiners .
