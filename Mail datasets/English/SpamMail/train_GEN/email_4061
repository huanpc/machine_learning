^ hi &name ! 
^ have n't emailed you in ages so i thought i 'd drop you a line ! 
^ in answer to this email that i got from you before exams and stuff - oops ... sorry ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ a friend ; &name , and i decided that we would walk down the &name to see what it was like at the other end , and before we knew it , there were huge crowds on either side of us , separated from us by police . 
^ so we walked on , loving every minute of it ! 
^ and because we were walking confidently , the police did n't even challenge us ! 
^ we got all the way to the market place before we were told that we really should n't be in the road , so we turned around and walked all the way back up the police-guarded path through the people . 
^ i think i would do well at being famous !

^ * grins * you know , &name , i can so see you doing this ! 
^ shame you did n't get to chat with the queen though ! 
^ &name 's pretty full at the moment , but in a good way ! 
^ myt friend &name came to stay on monday till wednesday , which was fun , but tiring - he can be a bit intense in large doses ! ! ! 
^ we then had a practice for the barn supper ( big evangelistic event with music etc ) on monday night , and the actual barn supper on tuesday , which with &name being around too totally wiped me out ! ! 
^ one of my friends from church had to drive us home because i was n't up to it ! 
^ it was good though . 
^ then on thursday night we had band practice , and on friday i went swimming with folks from church plus &name , who 'd come down to visit &name ... she is dead cool , she went back yesterday , and really miss her already ! ! 
^ she 's a very groovy chick ! 
^ on saturday me , &name , &name , &name and &name went to an event in &name called the call , which was a prayer and fasting thing , it was good but a bit knackering ... it started at &num with music and stuff , then from midday till &name was the main event , so you can imagine we were pretty exhausted after a day of that and no food , then we had the journey back home too ! ! ! 
^ then yesterday was church church and some more church , then today i went into newent to see &name off and spend some time with her &name and &name . 
^ so , as you can imagine , &num mega-tired &name . 
^ it 's been a lot of fun though , but the last &num weeks have felt more like &num months ! 
^ i am getting really involved with things at church which is good - at the moment what i really need is to just be in the middle of a big church family and so far it 's working out pretty well ! ! ! 
^ i have changed churches because it just was getting a little depressing at my old church 
^ - most weeks i was the youngest by about &num or even &num years , and the teaching is not that great . 
^ so i started going to a different local church in the mornings , and then in the evenings too , and it has really helped ... we have just done a course on spiritual maturity which was exactly what i needed and i really feel that things are going pretty well on that front at the moment . 
^ my other exciting news is that i am buying a house ! 
^ how scary and grown up is that ? 
^ things are finally starting to move so i could even have moved out by the middle of august . 
^ pray for me ! ! ! 
^ anyway i am really tired and i need to go to bed very soon - just waiting for a friend who had to restart the computer , and i promised i 'd wait ... do n't know why it 's taking him so long ! ! ! 
^ ahh well . 
^ anyway , hope all is well with you , let me know how things are , 
^ take care and &name bless love &name xx
