^ dear &name , 
^ please come and sing with &name ! 
^ read on for details ... 
^ we did n't have a brilliant turnout at the &name &name rehearsal on monday , which meant that the committee and i have had to rethink our concert plans for next tuesday . 
^ after all the time and effort that many people have put into the choir since january , we were loath to pull the plug on the concert altogether , but we recognised that a lot of you have &num other distractions in this hectic may week period . 
^ so we 're going to try and reconstitute next tuesday 's event into something a bit different . 
^ the plan is now to have a " hybrid " event : a short concert in chapel comprising the &name , &name and &name we have been rehearsing ( plus perhaps some simple extra items , eg more movements of &name , to pad it out a little bit ) , after which point the choir and audience will decamp outdoors ( ideally to the lakeside ) for refreshments , concluding with some madrigals from the choir . 
^ we will aim to start the chapel bit at &num with the outdoor bit following at circa &num ; in this way , the whole event will combine nicely with formal hall for those who want to make an evening of it , or with &name balls for those of you who are going on to a ball . 
^ the audience will pay a set charge for the whole package , ie indoor + outdoor music and refreshments , but you will get the experience for free ! 
^ we should be able to mount this simplified programme on relatively little rehearsal . 
^ the schedule will be : sunday 16th , &num ( yes , during the &name event , but we will rehearse in chapel ! ) monday 17th , &num tuesday 18th , &num run through , concert at &num . 
^ please come and sing with us for this ! 
^ it will be fun , and hopefully a manageable time commitment for everybody . 
^ in order to proceed , we need to know that we have viable numbers ... so please respond to me by &name noon ( by e-mail , phone or text message ) and let me know whether you are on board for this . 
^ if you are , please confirm which reharsals you can make . 
^ ( if you have difficulty over some of the rehearsal times , this can be negotiated with me . ) 
^ keep the slots free , and i will re-confirm to everyone by saturday lunchtime what is happening . 
^ hear back from you all soon ...
