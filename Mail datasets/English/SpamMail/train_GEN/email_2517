^ the title is "  ame " so is it wider than the linguistics department - ie attracting papers from other depts ? ^  ame has its own working papers ( called unambiguously " rceal working papers " ) . ^ if  ame is wider than the ling . ^ dept then that would be better for a potential  ame publisher . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^  ame 's mission is to publish papers written by students of the cu linguistics department . ^ so , the reasoning behind publishing the  ame proceedings is to promote the fame of the linguistics department 's students ( roughly quoted from  ame  ame  ame ) , who are going to publish in the  ame proceedings as well ... ^ even if we publish the proceedings ourselves , the cost of  um book should n't exceed  um pounds ( according to  ame  ame  ame ) as we might be able to use the copil arrangements with printers in  ame . ^  ame actually recommended to publish the proceedings ourselves , because we would have much lesser restrictions with layout guidelines and quality control . ^ copil would also restrict our freedom to choose , what the final product would look like ! ^ the only thing that we are missing , he thinks , is the experience how to publish a book . ^ and that is what copil could offer us anyway , even without being our publisher . ^ best wishes , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
