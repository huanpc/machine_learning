^ dear &name 
^ this friday is the last day of " full term " . 
^ if you have been residing in &name ( nights and days ) without a break since 8th october then you will now be able to confirm that you have " kept term " . 
^ this is a requirement of your degree course . 
^ it is also a requirement that you let me know that you have indeed kept term . 
^ please reply to this message to confirm the fact . 
^ ( please do make sure that your name appears in the email ! ! ) 
^ if you have not been in &name for the whole period of full term ( &num &name to &num &name ) then you can make up the missing days by using the residence period . 
^ this extends either side from 1st october to 19th december . 
^ ( you cannot go earlier or later than those dates ) 
^ in total you are required to be residing in &name for &num weeks between the dates of 1st october and 19th december . 
^ sorry about the length of this message - it is of course the first time for many of you , so i hope it is all clear . 
^ if you have any questions , do ask me please . 
^ of course , those of you who have already completed the required &num terms for their phd and are overrunning , are not required to " ' keep term " . 
^ equally , anyone who has permission to work away on fieldwork does not have to . 
^ best wishes for a happy break over the christmas period .
