^ hi &name , &name you 're having a good week , sorry it 's taken me so long to get back to you- feeling rather 'swamped " at the moment and very behind on emails ... 
^ well i seem to have so much stuff today and so much to fit in before the weekend that i do n't really think i can do today any more ... so that leaves saturday- unless sunday afternoon is any good to you ? 
^ i know i 'd feel a lot less rushed on sunday , as that 's my day off anyway , but if you 'd prefer saturday then lunch could work ... 
^ sorry to be brief , must go now ... 
^ take care , love &name

^ how are you ? 
</text_embedded>

^ very well thanks - feeling much more relaxed ( peversely for exam term ) than last term . 
^ i guess that exam stress just has n't quite struck yet. . 
<text_embedded> 

^ yes , been a while- but time 's flying by at the &name , guess it always does at this time of year- so much to do , so little time . ... 
^ how was &name harvest ? 
</text_embedded>

^ great thanks - i 'll tell you more about it when i see you again 
<text_embedded> 

^ yes , would be good to catch up and chat about mission stuff , as you say ... i 'm actually going home this weekend ( mum 's 50th ) , so wo n't be at &name morning or evening . 
</text_embedded>

^ hope you 're having / had ( depending on when you receive this e-mail ) a good weekend 
<text_embedded> 

^ my schedule 's not too full really , juts trying to fit in work around everything else &smiley let 's see ... here are the times i should usually be free ( some sups i don' [ &char yet know about ) 
^ mon : &num , &num , &num ... 
^ &name : any time except i may have &name some time between &num and &num not evening wed : before &num , possibly &num ( as on &name ) , after 8.30ish &name : before &num &name : before &num ( but depends on &name ) sat : probably wo n't be going to &name / &name until june so any time &name : do n't usually have anything except &name and phoning home some time in the afternoon ... 
</text_embedded>

^ hmm ... until now i did n't realise quite how full my schedule was . 
^ it seemed light and easy . 
^ then i did a spreadsheet to find cross-over times and found just how few there were ! 
^ hmmm . 
^ anyway , monday and tuesday wo n't work . 
^ wednesday i can make 4pm if you are free then ( perhaps go for a coffee somewhere ) , or alternatively from about 8.45ish ( yes , we 're supposed to finish at around &num too , but &num is more realistic ) . 
^ thursday is out because i 'm going to &name for an audition in the afternoon and have stuff in the morning / midday . 
^ friday i can only do _after_ &num ! 
^ so if wednesday is no good , then it has to be saturday , in which case perhaps lunchtime would be a good time as it then need not interfere with getting work done . 
^ of the &num above , i 'll leave the choice to you , depending on how things plan out for the week ahead . 
^ see you soon , take care 
^ love &name 
<text_embedded> 

^ sorry to sound too much like a diary- but this is by far the quickest way , as you well know &smiley hope one of these times coincides with your free time ! 
^ see you soon , take care , love &name
