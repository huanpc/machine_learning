^ did you ask him to perform in the canteen ? 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ it was n't a typo , no. but both probably are applicable . 
^ but just what , exactly , is &name &name supposed to perform ? 
^ ( no , i did n't ask him to ... ) 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal>

<text_embedded> 

^ fun is a noun , and therefore it 's semantics can be desribed as a &num place predicate fun ( &char ) where &char is some object variable . 
^ okay ? 
^ &name - fun can also be an adjective . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ i 'm sticking with my original answer , since i was answering for the particular word * sense * ( not orthography ) you cited . 
^ however , in the case of the adjective " fun " , fun is also a &num place predicate fun2 ( &char ) where &char is some object * or * event variable . 
^ satisfied ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ no. prove it using lambda calculus .

</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ &name ... that 's a horrible thing to say . 
^ &smiley unless you meant great in terms of mass or volume or general quantity . 
^ in which case , i 'm in full agreement . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i have no idea what you mean by this - be it good , bad or rabbit-like . 
^ however , i 'll terminate this thread with " what you said may have some relevance "
