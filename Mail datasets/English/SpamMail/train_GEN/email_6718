^ just wondered if we should ( for instance ) have a policy on which software we installed , or recommended , etc. obviously this might be somewhat dependant on individual circumstances , but in general , do you think we should be recommending specific software e.g. &name , properly installed &name , &name , &name and &name &name , &name , blackice . 
^ secondly , should we be offering to help set up ( via poster in pighole room / fliers in pigholes ) such software on the computers of users who do n't have any specific problems , on the grounds that it 's easier to prevent problems than to cure them ? 
^ there 's plenty of us , and once we get it figured out , it might not take too long to do . 
^ this would be aimed at people who were n't even confident enough to follow the instructions available for such things .
