^ &name , 
^ i am now in &name working for a christian charity called &name ( pronounced " therma " ) , which has been set up to disciple young christians ( mainly teenagers ) . 
^ for those of you who i have n't already asked , would it be ok if i sent you prayer letters now and then ? 
^ many of the teenagers in &name have come from bad backgrounds . 
^ some have been unmanageable and some have been abused . 
^ many have had problems with drugs and alcohol . 
^ they all live together , in &num houses ( &num for the girls and one for the boys ) i am living with them . 
^ i do n't know exactly what i will be doing yet but i have been told that they want to do many youth events and outreach , so i will get involved as we go along . 
^ please could you pray for me as i adjust to the language and culture , you may be aware that i speak next to no spanish and everything is different here . 
^ i will write a bit more when i have some more time . 
^ for the moment , &name bless you and please write back !
