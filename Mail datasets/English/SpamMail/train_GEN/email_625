^ " hello you &num " , 
^ " well , today i have eaten a bowl of cereal and a piece of toast , so i have not just had " how is &name ? " . 
^ you should eat more , &name . " - i am lost . 
^ " &name , please stop punctuating your emails with those stupid &name signs , it drives me mad . 
^ i feel foreign and unable to read your emails properly . " - &name &name , you see i write my emails in word and when i copy them to &name strange things must happen . 
^ i shall try and make this one look normal . 
^ " &name , you are not thrifty , but what is the point of thrift ( cf. that bit in the &name / godspell about not storing your treasures on earth ) . 
^ we should spend spend spend , thus i am going clothes shopping soon . " - cf. that bit in the &name about being a good steward . 
^ but spending money is definitely fun . 
^ i thought you 'd just been clothes shopping 
^ - on the internet ? 
^ " today i have sent off my thing to national savings which will enable me to redeem the money my parents have saved for me , i have done washing , i have changed my bed , had coffee with &name who amended my &name so that it now blatantly lies about how good i am at things . " - &name , do you have a national savings account ? 
^ i do too - but i suppose that 's not surprising . 
^ you did your washing - i miss doing my washing &name 's are never supposed to be an accurate reflection - of course they 're meant to exaggerate . 
^ " i have done no work . 
^ i do n't care . " - is n't it strange that one never gets lots of work done on the same day as one 's friends . 
^ i found that last year in the flat with &name - he often told me he 'd done &num hours work , and i 'd done the crossword . 
^ anyway , i got lots of work done yesterday - but not to be too annoying , it did n't really get me anywhere and i 'm still stuck even though i did n't stop " till &name . 
^ oh dear ! 
^ " he [ &name &name ] said his new shoes were " nice and waterproof " and i said he sounded like &name . 
^ he said that he was aware that this was not a compliment . 
^ i did not mean it as an insult . 
^ he also said that i was very sarcastic . 
^ am i too sarcastic ? " - no , no , no , of course not . 
^ you have a very nice level of sarcasm . 
^ it 's part of your personality . 
^ a non-sarcastic &name would be a very peculiar creature indeed . 
^ and i like sarcasm . 
^ " &name , my friend &name in &name &name wants to know how you are . " - oh , that 's nice . 
^ please tell her i 'm much better thank you and i hope she is well too and anything else you can think of . 
^ ( that 's the one i met when i was at your house is n't it ? ) 
^ " love you both , in varying relationships . 
^ &name xx " - just what on earth is that supposed to mean ? ? ? 
^ that can be taken in many different ways . 
^ love you both , in the same relationship . 
^ &name 
^ ( i know that sounds bad , but you know what i mean . 
^ anyway , it 's no worse than &name 's. )
