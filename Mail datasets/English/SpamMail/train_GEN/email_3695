^ &num day a group of scientists got together and decided that man had come a long way and no longer needed &name . 
^ so they picked &num scientist to go and tell him that they were done with him . 
^ the scientist walked up to &name and said , " &name , we 've decided that we no longer need you . 
^ we 're to the point 
^ that we can clone people and do many miraculous things , so why do n't you just go on and get lost . " 
^ &name listened very patiently and kindly to the man . 
^ after the scientist was done talking , &name said , " very well , how about this ? 
^ let 's say we have a man-making contest . " to which the scientist replied , " okay , great ! " 
^ but &name added , " now , we 're going to do this just like i did back in the old days with &name . " 
^ the scientist said , 'sure , no problem " and bent down and grabbed himself a handful of dirt . 
^ &name looked at him and said , " no , no , no. you go get your own dirt ! "
