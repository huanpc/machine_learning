^ i am indeed working pretty hard , although i 'm getting to the 'middle of term " phase now , and feeling a bit weary . 
^ i 've been beset by unfortunate events the last few days - my bike lights were taken on sunday while i was in &name , and then today my trouser clips were also taken ! 
^ so , i had to go to the bike shop to get some more ; &name is a dangerous place ! 
^ finally , my shaver flew apart and i lost a vital spring down the plug-hole , so i 'm trying to decide where i can get a tiny little spring from ... 
^ otherwise all is well - i had a football match today but it was cancelled .
