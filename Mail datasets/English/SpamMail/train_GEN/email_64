^ hi , 
^ just a friendly ( i hope ) message to say that we noticed you did n't have the tick for session one of the practicals yet . 
^ there 's no requirement to get a tick every week as long as you get them all by the end of term , so if this is just because you forgot , or the demonstrator was too busy , or whatever , then that 's fine . 
^ but if you are having problems , please let me ( or &name ) know asap . 
^ best , 
^ &name
