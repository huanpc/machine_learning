^ hey &name what 's going on ? 
^ how 's school going ? 
^ i 'm back in &name for the first time in a loooong time today . 
^ i was at nationals for the last &num weeks , and before that i was somewhere else ( i ca n't remmber right now ) . 
^ i have a midterm this thrusday -- i 'm going to get smoked by it ! 
^ &name were alright , but the frist &num days were cancelled due to codl weather and getting up in the mornign and getting ready to race and then being told that wea re n't racing really wore on me and threw me off for the first race . 
^ my head was n't into it for the first race , and i just could n't get myself going after the strat . 
^ our school had a good realy ( 2nd ) and i had a good secodn half of the 30km race ( the first &num laps were bad becasue i could n't get my body feeling light and snappy , and my breathing was off ) , so i 'm actually happy for once with my nationals . 
^ i 'm a first year senior ( age &num ) , so my results are n't really all that . 
^ i 'm already planning for next year . 
^ it has finally snowed a lot in &name bay -- jsut in time for the end of the race season ! 
^ that 's alright though , because i am going to the &num km nationals championship race in &num eeks , a nd i need snow to train on until then of course ! 
^ i 'm looking forward to that race -- i found a pace in the 30km last weeks that i know ai can hold for a &num . 
^ we had a pretty good party after the last race , and i found my way home afterwards , so it was a good night ! 
^ now i 'm back in reality world ( aka , school ) and i 'm wishing that i could go racing soemwhere agian , but i 'll have to wait for that i guess . 
^ i 'm meeting someone to do soem work soon , so i 've gotta go . 
^ i hope taht all is well with you and yours -- take care .
