^ &char wealthy man decided to go on a safari in &name . 
^ he took his faithful pet dog along for company . 
^ &num day the dog starts chasing butterflies and before long he discovers that he is lost . 
^ so , wandering about he notices a leopard heading rapidly in his direction with the obvious intention of having lunch . 
^ the dog thinks , " &name , i 'm in deep doo-doo now . " ( he was an irish setter ) . ... then he noticed some bones on the ground close by , and immediately settles down to chew on the bones with his back to the approaching cat . 
^ just as the leopard is about to leap , the dog exclaims loudly , &name , that was &num delicious leopard . 
^ i wonder if there are any more around here ? 
^ " hearing this the leopard halts his attack in mid stride , as a look of terror comes over him , and slinks away into the trees . 
^ " &name " , says the leopard . 
^ " that was close . 
^ that dog nearly had me . " 
^ meanwhile , a monkey who had been watching the whole scene from a nearby tree , figures he can put this knowledge to good use and trade it for protection from the leopard . 
^ so , off he goes . 
^ but the dog saw him heading after the leopard with great speed , and figured that something must be up . 
^ the monkey soon catches up with the leopard , spills the beans and strikes a deal for himself with the leopard . 
^ the cat is furious at being made a fool of and says , " here monkey , hop on my back and see what 's going to happen to that conniving canine . " now the dog sees the leopard coming with the monkey on his back , and thinks , " what am i going to do now ? " but instead of running , the dog sits down with his back to his attackers pretending he has n't seen them yet . 
^ and just when they get close enough to hear , the dog says , " where 's that monkey . 
^ i just can never trust him . 
^ i sent him off half an hour ago to bring me another leopard , and he 's still not back ! ! "
