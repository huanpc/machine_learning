^ &name , it 's pretty important , is n't it . 
^ i 'm not too ashamed to admit that i 've just started using &name &name , and although it probably automatically sells all my personal details &smiley , it does manage to update windows at the right time - it told me i needed the patch just now , along with a couple of other non-critical updates . 
^ people need to be aware that " critical &name " means " &name me now " . 
^ the &name , i believe , archives at least some windows patches .
