^ &char heard that you 've had the same sort of thing that i had earlier this week , and provisionally i 'm postponing security tomorrow ( by a week ) . 
^ is this ok ? ? ? 
^ i do n't know &char ) whehter i have done any work or &char ) will be there , as i was under the impression that you did n't make supervisions today ( thurs ) . 
^ i hope this is ok , and i 've fwd' &name the email i 'm sending &name to you as well . 
^ hope i get better soon , perhaps see you in lectures tomorrow if you are feeling better . 
^ sorry abt this bad communication , i just suddenly thought that as i 'd not done the work , and i was n't sure if you had it might be better to postpone ... i did ask &name to ask you about it , as he said he 'd visit , but kinda lost track of everything that was going on . 
^ sorry my fault . 
^ hope this is ok ?
