^ hi &name 
^ oh my &name , i 'm replying quick ! ! 
^ your way of replying is sort of logic , but it 's just not what i 'm used to ! ! 
^ &name said that it takes a while to get used to , but she has started replying to some of hers like that too . 
^ the course i am doing next year is computing with &name and &name . 
^ last year i did programming in visual basic for applications ( procedural ) and this year i am doing &name ( event driven ) and c++ ( abstract data structures) . 
^ i really like delphi , its more user friendly and c++ has taken me a while to get to grips with , but its cool enough , although it has reduced me to tears on a number of occasions ! ! 
^ next year , at &name , it will be &name that is i will be doing , so i get a chance to try my hands at a few languages . 
^ what about yourself , what languages have you done ? 
^ i dont have a clue what &char want to do , theres no &num job that &char really want to do , but going to college then uni is sort of better than dossing about or working full time at the fish . 
^ but &char really dont have a clue what &char want to do , i would n't mind going travelling around european cities - basically trying to avoid work for as long as i can ! ! 
^ the thing is , &name and &name both know exactly what they want to do , so their lives are pretty much mapped out , but then i 'm absolutely clueless ! ! 
^ &name seemed like the " sensible " thing to do , &char never even did computing at school ! ! 
^ so we shall see ... 
^ &name , better go and do some of my project ( it 's making an accounts and registry system for &name dance classes - it started off really small , but has just sort of got a lot bigger ) &char only have &num weeeks left to finish my course ( i have &num weeks off for &name though ) so its a bit of panic stations here ! ! 
^ speak to you soon &name xx 
^ chat with friends online , try &name &name : &website
