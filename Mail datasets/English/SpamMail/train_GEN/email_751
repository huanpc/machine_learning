^ &name , 
^ how is my scottish friend ? 
^ who ! ? 
^ what ? ! 
^ where ? ! 
^ when ? ! 
^ most importantly why ? 
^ actually , i am fine . 
^ i 've just returned from my camp . 
^ it was fantastic , although i am absolutely totally mind-numbingly exhausted . 
^ i only got &num hours of sleep per night for the week . 
^ sleeping in a dormitory with &num hyperactive unnaturally energetic ten-year old kids has many disadvantages . 
^ however , i really enjoyed it all and the weather was perfectly splendid . 
^ i knew a few people before i got there and knew a lot more by the time i left . 
^ i was in &name &name yesterday ( not to see the golf , but to get a kettle ) and it was totally packed because of the open . 
^ i have just received a disconcertingly strange e-mail from &name about her bikini . 
^ i was absolutely disgusted . 
^ are you on holiday ? 
^ hmmm. that 's a difficult one . 
^ considering term finished on the 30th june and does n't start again until october yes ! 
^ i 'm going to &name on saturday though and looking forward to it all except the heat , the flight and the language difficulties . 
^ i only speak scottish and english . 
^ oh well ! 
^ it will be an experience i am sure ! 
^ i hope your work is going well and you are coping with the lack of spare time which you seem to have . 
^ considering i have n't stopped for literally more than &num minutes in the last week i can empathise with you considerably . 
^ i just cannot understand how &name can do one of those camps this &name ! 
^ she ca n't be human . 
^ now , on to business &name ! ! ! 
^ what ! ! ! 
^ &name is dead ! ! ! 
^ oh , thank goodness , it 's just a hoax ! 
^ that had be badly shaken for a moment there . 
^ do i take it rightly then ? 
^ - that &name has performed an elaborate hoax by staging the death of &name ? 
^ just wait till i see her . 
^ i am most displeased . 
^ i arranged a legally binding contract with &name 's &name &name ltd. i am not about to take this lying down . 
^ &name , old chap , would you send me the transcripts from the reporter who interviewed &name please ? 
^ i need some solid evidence to pursue my vendetta . 
^ some poor disillusioned girl from &name who lost it 
^ enough of the sympathy ! 
^ this is serious now . 
^ &name appeared to me in a dream last night . 
^ ( i had eaten some cheese the night before ) here is what i can remember of my dream 
^ as i slept , i saw a hazy black object speeding across a seemingly huge expanse of silvery grey sky . 
^ as i watched , the object began to grow in size and became darker and blacker than the deepest hole or cave you can imagine . 
^ what appeared to be stars began to spiral towards the object until there were so many that they flowed into it in the likeness of a milky river glistening with hundreds and thousands of precious stones . 
^ then the scene changed suddenly . 
^ i was standing on the top of a huge mountain , overlooking a city which i recognised . 
^ as i watched , an arrow of flaming fire appeared from the north and sped down into the heart of the city . 
^ sounds of wailing and moaning reached my ears as the entire city was consumed . 
^ the scene changed once again . 
^ i found myself standing on the banks of a cool shallow river . 
^ on the opposite bank a shadowy figure was lurking . 
^ i called on him in clear and ringing tones to show himself . 
^ he wore darkness as a cloak and his face was more alive looking than any i had ever beheld . 
^ he was a raven . 
^ he spoke to me in a language i did not understand , using words &num cannot remember . 
^ however , i understood his message . 
^ his face began to swim before me - i could see cities , kings and nations in his eyes . 
^ then all was black . 
^ the dream is interpreted as follows 
^ in the opening scene we see &name winging his way across the hiajfhboj , which is the equivalent of the lowlands in his home planet of &name sometimes described as planet of the &name . 
^ the increase in &name 's size correlates to his flourishing knowledge of the ways of men . 
^ his similarity to a black hole emphasises the idea persistent in siluhfodascian literature that they alone will &num day know everything , that there shall be no end to their knowledge and dominion . 
^ the river of stars represent those who oppress and defy &name , his people , the &name , and their ways . 
^ many are those , bright perhaps in their own way , but ultimately consumed . 
^ this scene represents the power and majesty of the &name . 
^ the second scene portrays the judgement on those who diss &name . 
^ the city represents &name and the judgement upon &name for staging &name 's death is inevitable . 
^ the arrow from the north is &name , stationed as he is in some secret location near my abode . 
^ this scene represents the terror and judgement of the &name . 
^ in the final scene the river portrays the uncrossable divide between the land of men and the &name . 
^ no man can ever set foot in &name perhaps this is just as well . 
^ the raven is a picture of &name 's people . 
^ their knowledge and antiquity burning bright but cloaked from us by vast distances in time and space . 
^ &name thought as a means of communication is briefly referred to here . 
^ the sudden end of the dream suggests a hint of what lies in the future for &name . 
^ could they be trying to pass on some of their ways and dominion to us as their time runs out . 
^ this scene represents the personality and communicativeness of the &name . 
^ thank you . 
^ make of that what you will , but it 's message is startlingly clear to me . 
^ i fear it came as a warning against us becoming to familiar with &name as to stage elaborate hoaxes . 
^ enough , no more , tis not as much as it was before - &name . 
^ the name &name has been banded about in relation to the &name incident , and some say that the aforementioned persona has had contact with the raven since the reported 'death " of &name . 
^ quite true . 
^ he followed me to &name camp . 
^ he observed me playing frisbee golf and football , was concealed in a tree as i was soaked with water by ten-year olds , peered through my dorm window as i caught some brief sleep . 
^ yes , i have had contact with &name , not to mention my dream . 
^ yours in &name 
^ &name
