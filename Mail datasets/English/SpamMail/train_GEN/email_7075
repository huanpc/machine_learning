^ hi 
^ sorry again for the stress i 've caused you ... 
^ i 've spent quite some time now familiarising myself with the code base and structure of the distribution system and i have some idea now about it . 
^ i had n't realised before that distribution system sat seperately and talked to both sides by &name , i thought that it just sat on the server side and talked locally to that . 
^ anyhow , i think i 've sussed that out and have been admiring and making a few changes to &name 's test code . 
^ i think as a basic test , it 's almost there , but i certainly ca n't test it at the moment because although the distribution server builds ok ( once you figure out how to build it ! ) , when you run it ( again , that took me some time to figure ) it crashes with a security error . 
^ i 've asked &name to let me know what 's wrong with that and then hopefully the distribution system can be tested . 
^ i 've taken their client and modified it so that it fails to return results a small number of times and returns the results repeatedly on other ocassions . 
^ we can extend this to other tests if we like , but these are what &name required . 
^ his workunit is the same principle as the workunit we discussed last saturday , but just adding &num to a number . 
^ i suggest that we only pass even numbers in the workunits when they go to the client and then all the workunits in the sink should have an odd numbered serial id . 
^ i have n't given any thought yet to testing of factorisation modules i 'm afraid other than what we previously discussed . 
^ if you 're free today , it might be worth us meeting up at some point - i suggest &name , but if you want to make it elsewhere for your convinience , feel free to do so . 
^ i 'm free approximately between &name and &name , though i 'll probably not check my e-mail between 8.30am and &name , so if you suggest a time at the start of that time slot , there will just be the delay in me getting that e-mail . 
^ perhaps see you later , otherwise let me know you thoughts / what you want me to do and i 'll do my best .

^ hi 
^ am just trying to sort out my diary for the next few days ( and need a minimum of &num hours per day ! ) . 
^ do you want to meet up on saturday ( say around &num noon ) ? 
^ &name sat i 'm meeting someone else at 10am which should only be around an hour , but leave &num just in case and then i 'm busy from &name onwards . 
^ tomorrow is busy , friday i may or may not be free in the evening - i 'm waiting to hear back from someone else on that . 
^ otherwise we 're into next week .
