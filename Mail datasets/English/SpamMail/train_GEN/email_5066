^ &name - 
^ do n't worry too much . 
^ there are &num lectures theatres on the ground floor and a large classroom on the first floor that are being equipped . 
^ i am sure that there will be somewhere for your lectures . 
^ we had planned to fit our the practical classroom on the second floor as well , but it now has a couple of walls dividing it and it is not clear how the space is meant to be used . 
^ any advice would be welcome . 
^ the &name consultants assure us that a screen can be built and installed in a week once it is known what is wanted . 
^ in the mean time , the walls are large , flat and white . 
^ apparently only free-standing projectors ( rather than ceiling mounted ) will be suitable on the second floor because of the high ceiling , so you should be able to wheel in your own overhead and video projectors . 
^ as a matter of interest , when are you proposing to start teaching in the &name building ? 
^ i had rather assumed that the &name would be taught in town until christmas at the earliest . 
^ - &name , &name .
