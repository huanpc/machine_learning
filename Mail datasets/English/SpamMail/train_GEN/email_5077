^ now we are at the end of the first week of moving i thought you might appreciate an update on current conditions in the new building . 
^ it is still very much a building site and somewhat lacking in the finer points of life , so come prepared to rough it for a while ! 
^ the card system is not yet finished but the building will be open between &num and &num on saturday , via the main doors off &name &name ave if you have your university card for identification . 
^ it will be closed on sunday but open again at &num on monday . 
^ keys to individual offices are being issued by &name &name so please do n't ask the secretaries for them . 
^ phones are being commissioned as and when people arrive so if you do n't have immediate access to a phone then please make any urgent calls from &name ( room gc03 ) . 
^ the fridges in the small kitchens are not ready yet , and there are various minor problems such as lack of cupboard door handles , but these are known about and will be fixed . 
^ at the moment we do n't have a common room so there is no provision for mass supplies of tea or coffee . 
^ but we do have a kettle and a chilled water machine ! ! 
^ very much &name . 
^ the sandwich van parks outside the main entrance for an hour each day from &num . 
^ some of the toilets have n't been commissioned yet so there may not be loo paper , paper towels and soap in some of them . 
^ check before using ! 
^ shelving is being installed slowly so do n't assume yours will be in place when you arrive . 
^ but it will come ! 
^ desks are in place and the task chairs are being delivered as i write so they should be in the remaining offices by monday . 
^ the &name and postal services are due to start on monday &num august so any outgoing post should be taken to &name and handed to one of the secretaries . 
^ we are still waiting for the pigeonholes to be installed but in the meantime we hope to have a temporary arrangement of boxes on the floor in the corridor between rooms gc03 and &name . 
^ the office lights have a built-in dimmer system which automatically dips the lights if the outside light level increases , so do n't assume they are broken ! 
^ i am sure there are other things i should point out , but i hope i 've covered the main concerns . 
^ if you have any problems or questions on arrival then please come and ask , but please do keep in mind that the building is n't finished yet and that there are bound to be some difficulties and irritations . 
^ but i 'm still here at &num on a friday afternoon so it ca n't be too bad ! 
^ &name
