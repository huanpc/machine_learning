^ hi again ,

^ hi &name and &name ! 
^ attached is a tarball of the code we &name folks wrote -- the parser ( whose main functions are : &name ( ) and &name ( ) which take the string as stored from the database ( so if the &name people did that stuff according to the specs we agreed on , nothing should go wrong there ) ) and extra stuff : 
^ inside &name / are the objects of all the predicates and expressions the parser creates . 
^ &name , doing a make in that directory creates one single object file : &name , containing all the components . 
^ the groupby box is also included : see &name / &name &name , it does not return box_out_c so that may need changing . 
^ you 'll also find a tuplegenerator little utility -- we used it for testing , since it now generates the tuples just as we saw done in the &name demo code don gave us . 
^ feel free to use it , since it 's nicely self contained . 
^ is there anyway we can already start looking into integrating stuff ? 
^ could you either give us all the cvs info we need ( &name , machine , etc ) and we 'll put this in , or if you can just check this in where it should be , then let us know what to do to check the whole &name stuff out and confirm things still work ) , or anything else we could help out with ? 
^ - &name , &name , &name - ( -- looks like a burger ; hot dog really &smiley
