^ hi &name , &name , and ming , 
^ i was wondering if any of you were planning on coming in today ( to &name ) and will be there at around lunch time . 
^ turns out that my key card was inactivated ( probably because i graduated ) so although i can get into my office , i ca n't get into &name . 
^ if you are planning on coming in , please let me know - i would like to come in as well and do some last minute printouts before leaving for &name at &num : &num .
