^ " witness : the evidence ... the truth about &name " 
^ &num &name &num : &num now if &name is proclaimed as raised from the dead , how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead ? 
^ &num if there is no resurrection of the dead , then &name has not been raised ; &num and if &name has not been raised , then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been in vain . 
^ &num we are even found to be misrepresenting &name , because we testified of &name that he raised christ' whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised . 
^ &num for if the dead are not raised , then &name has not been raised . 
^ &num if &name has not been raised , your faith is futile and you are still in your sins . 
^ &num then those also who have died &name in &name have perished . 
^ &num if for this life only we have hoped in &name , we are of all people most to be pitied . 
^ &num but in fact christ has been raised from the dead , the first fruits of those who have died . 
^ - &name &name ! 
^ - pray that &name will proclaim clearly &name 's resurection from the dead , and that the &name will be at work convicting people of this life-giving truth , and its implications for their lives . 
^ - pray for &name giving her testimony , that &name would enable her to speak clearly and boldly of his work in her life , that her friends will come to the talk , and that &name will open their eyes to his wonderful gospel .
