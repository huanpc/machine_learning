^ dear &name you brainiac , 
^ i have never understood how methods can be static it is so stupid and annoying and stops you being able to do anything useful ! ! 
^ i hate it it is so dumb and it serves no purpose ! 
^ i wrote a program in &num minutes to convert the date to milliseconds since the epoch . 
^ something i 'm sure everyone is dying to know , &name , okay . 
^ then i have spent the last &num hourse trying to convert the other way around - milliseconds to date to string . 
^ and i # $ * &@? * ing # % 
^ $ * ing ca n't understand what it is @ * # 
^ 
^ing saying ! ! ! 
^ &name i am so frustrated with it ! 
^ computers are supposed to make life easier , and all javac is doing is telling me " you 're doing it wrong , but i 'm not going to explain what 's wrong . 
^ go figure it out yourself you idiot . " 
^ i am sure that javac is a woman . 
^ or at least , was coded by a woman . 
^ please let me know what 's up ? 
^ all i want to know is what date and time &num and &num is . 
^ i tried using &name but surprise surprise &name does n't use the standard &name date format it uses its own format : &name which is totally useless . 
^ there . 
^ now i 've told someone else , it 's no longer my problem - it 's someone else 's problem . 
^ so i can stop biting my itchy fingers . 
^ do you ever get that ? 
^ i hate it - the tops of my middle joints of my fingers get itchy and i scratch and bite them but it does n't go away . 
^ drives me mad . 
^ grrr.
