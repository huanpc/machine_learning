^ &name people ! 
^ hope you all had fab christmases ! 
^ looking forward to seeing you all on monday - but have a small transport favour to ask ! 
^ &name &char is giving me a lift from &name to &name 's but he might not be able to give me a lift going home ( he 's off to &name ! ) i wondered if anyone was driving from the &name or even &name direction and could give me a lift to a train station . 
^ trains from &name to &name are usually easy to get , or i could get a train from &name if &name thinks they will be running on new year 's day . 
^ i 'm not very good on my train geography of that part of the world but i believe i have to go either to &name or &name and change for a &name service - any advice people ? 
^ ( or if anyone 's driving home via &name and &name my dad could probably meet you and pick me up ! ) 
^ okay - see you all tomorrow i hope ! 
^ love &name &char
