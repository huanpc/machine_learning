^ he is putting together a petition and organising a meeting on this sunday at 1pm in the &name room , &name 's. 
^ alternatively , you can attend &name 's meeting on the same issue as described below : 
^ " i am &name &name , &name 's &name &name officer and i am proposing , with &name &name ( &name president ) a no platform policy motion at &name 's open meeting this sunday . 
^ &char no platform policy would mean that &name would campaign against providing a high profile platform to speakers whose views are known to incite racial hatred , preventing their message of hatred and intolerance being relayed in any organis ation of &name university society . 
^ this would prevent the hate-filled free speech of extremists curtailing and infringing our freedoms , and harming the welfare and security of students of this university . 
^ " the no-platform policy motion is being tabled at a time when the members of various minority groups in &name university are already experiencing racially motivated abuse . 
^ to invite notable racists to air their disgusting and twisted views in the university is completely unacceptable in this climate , and yet both the &name &name and the &name &name propose to do just that , having invited the chairman of &name , &name &name , and &name &name &name ( a man who has regularly spoken in support of &name &name and other such organisations ) to speak at their events next term and next week respectively . 
^ " it is vital that this motion passes at sunday 's open &name . 
^ all university undergraduates are entitled to vote at &name open meetings , and we need to work together to ensure that this motion passes for the benefit of all students . 
^ furthermore , if this motion does pass , then it will hold a great deal of weight and put pressure on council voters to also pass the motion at the next council meeting . 
^ " the open &name takes place this sunday , &num december , in the &name room , &name college , &name road , at 7pm . 
^ i look forward to seeing you there . 
^ &name &name &name &name &name officer , &email or &email "

^ thank you !
