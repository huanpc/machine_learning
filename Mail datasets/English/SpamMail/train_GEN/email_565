^ dear &name , 
^ &name , i have n't heard that variety before . 
^ anyway , of course i realise your verse is far superior to &name 's. 
^ i however , being the tender-hearted barbarian that i am , did not want to hurt her feelings after the valiant attempt at poetry which she made . 
^ how many hours and drafts it must have taken her to produce such a composition as 
^ &char &name we love you we truly do ( and your pen ) where &char &char ? 
^ whilst your delightful creation surpasses the sublime 
^ &char &name i adore thee &name &name my favourite boy and when thou smilst at me i brings profoundest joy . 
^ i look forward to my imminent room inspection . 
^ i cannot comment on &name 's standards yet as i have still to see her room . 
^ as for the message you left on &name 's door , he thought that was from someone else . 
^ he could n't read your name . 
^ " we ask where you are because we do n't know , dimwit . 
^ we do n't know exactly where you are . 
^ and writing " &name , where are you ? 
^ see you soon , &name " is better &name " &name , you troll , you 're obviously out seducing an innocent first-year . 
^ leave them alone , you skulking great monster . " is n't it ? " 
^ - that 's nasty . 
^ i am not a dimwit . 
^ i was attending a lecture . 
^ of course it 's better to write the truth than lies . 
^ innocent first years ? 
^ whatever next . 
^ see you soon , 
^ love &name
