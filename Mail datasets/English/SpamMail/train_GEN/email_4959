^ hi professor &name , 
^ &name and i were wondering if we could verify what we agreed about the tumble box from wednesday 's meeting . 
^ in particular , i am not sure we can really move &num of the extra timeout parameters into the until clause like you and &name said . 
^ would you have time at all today to meet with &name and me , or would you rather we have this discussion over email ?
