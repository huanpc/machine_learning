^ &name obviously great minds think alike , since our e-mails crossed . 
^ congratulations on your new job . 
^ sounds great ( especially the lack of commuting ) . 
^ re the canoe trip . 
^ i looked at a map to try to find a good route on the east side - but did n't see much . 
^ the other problem , of course , is that it would be a long drive if we wa n't to go all the way to the east side . 
^ i assume the thought about the east was mainly to do something different , so some thoughts : 
^ - entrance &num ( &name lake ) is south-east . 
^ not bad , but somewhat limited in how far we can go without hitting some big portages . 
^ - we could do &name lake entry again , but head south out of &name .. looking at the map we could go to &name on the first day - only &num portage ( but it is 1.8k ) . 
^ then islet on day &num and &num ( &num portages to get there , but shorter - &num less than &num , &num about &num ) . 
^ on the second day we could do a day trip , or do a backpacking trip since we would be close to the backpack trail . , then a &num and &num back to &name lake ( we do a loop ) . 
^ - we could do just a backpacking run out of &name lake ( &name has done this with his camping ) . 
^ ( advantage of no canoe rental . ) 
^ - we could enter at the enrance above &name ( &name / butt ) and design a route through there . 
^ i think you have been there before . 
^ - we could go south off of highway &num . 
^ give me some thoughts . 
^ i am sending in a separate e-mail an &name version of the algonquin map for you to look at . 
^ re timing - i know &name and &name are looking forward to seeing you - and there is not a hope that &name will go canoeing . 
^ that probably means coming to our cottage , or maybe you could meet them somehow in &name after the canoe trip . 
^ let me know your thoughts . 
^ talk to you later .

^ dear &name , 
^ things have been sufficiently busy around here that i do not remember when i last was in contact . 
^ the main reason for this message is to get your thoughts on the canoe trip . 
^ the current plans are for us to finish at the cottage on saturday august 11th . 
^ at that point we could go directly on a canoe trip , go ( i think relatively briefly ) to your cottage and then make a trip on the east side of the park , return to &name and meet up with you later in the week , or ? ? ? 
^ our flights back will likely be on sunday august 19th . 
^ what would be your preference ( &char ) ? 
^ also , i think you have said that now campsites have to be booked so could you look after that . 
^ we can work out food plans after we know what we are doing . 
^ i am pleased that i have finally got a job in &name so i can leave the commuting behind from next fall . 
^ it seems like a good opportunity at the medical research council unit there as it is basically a straight research post and i have had less and less time for that in recent years . 
^ it will be nice to have some time to think . 
^ &name and &name have both returned to university for terms with important exams . 
^ &name is then off to &name for &num weeks for a geology mapping project . 
^ &name , &name and i plug on at home . 
^ &name all is well there ,
