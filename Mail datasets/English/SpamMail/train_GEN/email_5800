^ guys as far as i can tell we now have the all clear to give away &num copies of &name 's gospel at the concert . 
^ &name - can you please get your stash to &name " ( leave them with the porters for &name or something , or bring them to the &name ) . 
^ &name / &name - perhaps you could take the &num from me at the &name on friday if either of you will be there .

^ &name &name paid for the gospels personally and therefore needs to invoice &name and &name with their shares of the bill . 
^ the issue is over whether we can now afford to give all the spare gospels away at the concert event , as the concert event have n't bugetted for it ...

^ hey &name , sorry , &char obviously did n't send my last mail properly . 
^ &char may ahve got the wrong end of the stick , but i was assuming that &name main would buy the &name 's gospels , because we received a acheque specifically for the me which just nicely covered the cost of them . 
^ however , i have not seen an invoice for them to this point .

^ &char quick calculation concludes , i think , that we can have &num for the concert . 
^ i have n't heard anything back from &name yet though , so this all depends on the financial situation as well . 
^ &name - what 's your thinking ? 
^ &name 
^ on the ball you think is another organised although this mission of a few " &name &name
