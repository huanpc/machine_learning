^ everyone suggests that we copy the entire &name repository to &name . 
^ that way , the examiners shall have access to all versions . 
^ let me know if that 's fine . 
</text_embedded>

^ oh , i have done that . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ thank you very much for doing this . 
^ however , as i had suggested .. and also because everyone is still coding , could we take out the copy of the repository at midnight on sunday ( i.e. tomorrow midnight ) . 
^ i just thought that it might be prudent to check 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ out a particular version into a seperate folder ( ~lima rather ~repository ) so that the examiners do n't have to mess around with &name for the version they are to mark . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ rite ... so when you take out the final copy tomorrow midnight-ish , take out a particular version also ...

^ i fully appreciate your sentiments . 
^ i would like you to focus onthe technical bits of the paper today and maybe finalise the &name file-space late in the evening on sunday . 
^ that 's about it . 
</text_embedded>

^ ok , that 's fine 
<text_embedded> 

^ i shall get in touch with &name , &name and &name and let you know when to take the final &name snapshot to be placed ion our &name space . 
</text_embedded>

^ note that it can be taken in retrospect , so if you all decide that the version we want is as the &name was at &num : 52pm on thursday or whatever , then we can do that .
