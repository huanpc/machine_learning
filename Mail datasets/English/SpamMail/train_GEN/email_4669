^ &name , i have email access - have my own work email address and all that but think it best to do personal stuff on my hotmail account . 
^ yeah , and i 'm still living at the same place . 
^ it 's not ideal as it takes &num minutes to get into work , but it 's keeping me fit as i am cycling in and out . 
^ i good hour or so 's vigourous exercise to get me in shape for &name ( where i have to play football and netball everyday ! ) . 
^ not bad ... 
^ i 'm so busy right now though , which is always good as it keeps my mind occupied and i do n't get so worked up about &name related issues &smiley crazy boy , going off to &name ! 
^ how does he expect to get stunning grades like yours unless he puts the work in ? 
^ &smiley oh well ... 
^ &name , &name , &name is all guns blazing right now as i have just launched my mail order service ( hee hee ) and am doing some ground work for getting them into gift shops here in &name . 
^ it 's all a bit frustrating ( in the best sense though ) , coz no sooner have i made a selection of cards to take to shops than someone wants to buy them so i have n't anything to show the shop people . 
^ so , i have been working away when i get back from work to build up a good stockpile and hope to decend on several stores by the end of the week / early next . 
^ &name , have to get back to work . 
^ take care and all that , love &char
