^ just quickly , before my lovely lecture ... would any of you like to come to a workshop on thursday about " &name and the &name &name " ? 
^ i think it will be fun ... it starts at 7.30pm and lasts for about an hour and a half . 
^ the only pre-requisites are having watched ( at some point ) 'snow &name " and " beauty and the beast " . 
^ anyway , just thought i 'd ask . 
^ &name 's fiction is the only bit of my degree i enjoy- it would be nice to share it with you ! 
^ love &name xx &name do let me know .
