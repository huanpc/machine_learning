^ bible study leaders feedback 
^ choosing leaders and groups 
^ &num did you expect to be asked to lead a &name study ? 
^ were you pleased ? 
^ did you feel prepared ? 
^ yes . 
^ yes . 
^ sort of , yes . 
^ &num is there anything we could have done to help you feel more prepared ? 
^ no. the cu training days are good if you go to them . 
^ ( i 'm very bad and do n't. ) if people want more info , tell them to go to the training things , both in the weeks and before each topic . 
^ also it helps if the leaders actually know about the book before they start . 
^ &name have read a commentary , and the whole book . 
^ ( though i understand this takes time and i do n't do it enough . 
^ sorry . ) 
^ &num how did you feel about the choice of the other &name ( specifically your co-leader / &char ) ? 
^ last year - ( &name and &name ) absolutely shocking . 
^ this is my own opinionbut ... 
^ a few people were asked to lead who 's knowledge of the bible and lifestyle should have flagged them up as not leaders ! 
^ we must be careful not to just give these very important positions to anyone . 
^ have bigger groups if nessesary . 
^ do n't give these things to just everyone . 
^ perhaps i 'm too judgemental ( i know i am ) but i really feel that leaders should be able to perform some of the pastoral duties that are so lacking in the church and cu . 
^ when you do n't respect the leaders , this is very hard to do . 
^ &num were you pleased with the distribution of people into groups ( especially freshers ) ? 
^ &name 
^ &num do you feel there was anything we could have done to improve the choosing of &name and the distribution of people into groups ? 
^ see above . 
^ it might be nice to keep the groups roughly the same over the &num years , if hard with leaders changing , but it really would help with the support . 
^ if you know the people already , then you will not have to spend the first term and a half of every yearbeing shy and only answering shallowly . 
^ &name and &name 
^ &num once the &name studies were set up we mostly left you to your own devices . 
^ did you like this , or would you have appreciated more support ? 
^ i liked it , but that 's because a " , &char arrogant and independant . 
^ &num would you like to have met more often as a group of leaders or do you have enough meetings already ? 
^ no. enough meetings . 
^ &num do you go to the &name training on thursday lunchtimes ? 
^ how useful is it ? 
^ no. 
^ &num how much do you use the &name &name ? 
^ not at all a little , mostly for the passage and structure yes , usually we use most of the questions , with minor revision we follow the sheets exactly 
^ &num do you meet up with your co-leaders before monday ? 
^ no 
^ &num do you prepare for the &name study in any other way ? 
^ yes , on my own , using commentaries . 
^ &name speaks today is usually pretty good as well , as it deals with applications and not so much deep theology . 
^ format and style 
^ &num how important to you is building up relationships within the group ? 
^ do you think it is more important to concentrate on studying the &name ? 
^ have you done anything specific to encourage people to get to know each other ? 
^ very . 
^ equally important to study bible . 
^ the &num should go hand in hand . 
^ a closer and better knowledge of &name will lead to closer and better relationships within the grpoup an cu as a whole . 
^ what is important is if we actually take what the bible says , and do it ! 
^ so often , we 'll look at a passage and give the right answers , but then go away without acting on it . 
^ why ? 
^ grrrr. 
^ &num how well do you think your group has " bonded and grown ? 
^ how much or little did the &name content and / or your leadership have anything to do with this ? 
^ how well have you personally got to know the people in your group ? 
^ pretty well . 
^ not as good as last year , yet , but there is time . 
^ not trying to be arrogant again , but if i 'm honest the reason i wnated to lead again is that the leaders do matter . 
^ of course they influence how the group bonds . 
^ if you have a leader who dominates the discussion and who champions unbiblical phillosophies , you will not have a greatly bonded group , unless that 's what peopel want . ... 
^ to get the groups to &name better , encourage people to come to this more than the cu meeting as a whole ... here is teaching , and training , and support . 
^ when you have drifters too , then we have the whole openness problem coming back . 
^ particularly if the drifters are big seen people in the cu . 
^ encourage regular attendance . 
^ very important . 
^ &num how large is your group ? 
^ is this too large / too small ? 
^ what are the advantages and disadvantages of having a group this large / small ? 
^ around &num people good size , but could be bigger , ( see rant above ) 
^ &num apart from the &name &name itself , have you done anything else in your groups , e.g. pray ? 
^ every week - prayer very important part of bible study . 
^ &num would you change anything about the format of your bible study in particular , or the groups in general ? 
^ would you do anything differently if you were to do it again ? 
^ encourage peoeple to come every week . 
^ get people to read passage ( and commentary ? ) before hand , so that the discussion goes beyond the basic ... 
^ the future 
^ &num do you have any other comments or advice for future &name &name leaders and for &name and &name ? 
^ see above 
^ &num do you have any specific ideas or general comments about how the &name &name content might be improved ? 
^ see above 
^ &num what qualities / characteristics should &name and &name be looking for when they choose new &name study leaders in the summer ? 
^ look for the qualities the bible suggests for leaders ... not new converts , not taken to too much wine , etc. .. good knowledge ... 
^ &num what is / are the purpose / &char of the &name studies and do you think these have been achieved ? 
^ have you fulfilled your own aims for the year ? 
^ to learn more about &name to apply this to our lives to encourage and support each other in our walks with &name and everyday life too . 
^ to pray about issues which concern us 
^ and out from this , friendships will naturally form , but that 's not the main thing . 
^ vision ? 
^ thank you for your comments and advice , they are much appreciated . 
^ &name and &name 
^ do you &name ! ?
