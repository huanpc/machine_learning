^ below is the statement from the &name about the restructuring of the service for you to read and circulate if you feel appropriate . 
^ individual counselling at the university counselling service 
^ background 
^ in the last few years waiting times to receive ongoing counselling at the &name have gradually increased with the increasing numbers of students using the service , though they remained within reasonable bounds until early &num . 
^ by last &name , though , waiting times became unduly long and the service had to take serious and uncomfortable steps in response ; senior tutors were informed about this at the time . 
^ setting clearer priorities 
^ the executive committee was already working on these issues and recognised that in order to meet the growing demand while keeping costs within a level acceptable to the majority of colleges , the service would need to work rather differently and not simply ? 
^ do more of the same? . 
^ as a result we have made the following changes to our individual counselling which we believe will improve our service to the great majority of students : 
^ &num we have changed our intake procedures in order to be able to respond more quickly and offer several sessions without a wait to those students who can be helped within a brief period . 
^ this will significantly cut waiting times for many of those who come to the &name . 
^ &num we already know that significant benefits can be achieved in relatively few counselling sessions for many problem areas , so we are focusing our counselling more closely and as a result are working more briefly than in the past with many clients . 
^ ( the great majority of the work the &name undertakes is brief in any case , with over &num of students being seen &num times or less . ) 
^ &num at the other extreme , we are stopping offering unlimited individual counselling , instead offering up to a maximum of &num individual counselling sessions in any year except in exceptional circumstances . 
^ this will still enable a few clients to be seen individually throughout &num terms , or fortnightly throughout the year , where there are necessary therapeutic reasons to do this . 
^ ( last year just one of &name clients were seen individually for more than &num sessions . ) 
^ other initiatives to expand our group counselling ( including long-term groups ) and outreach work are also in progress and further details about these will be contained in the forthcoming annual report for the service . 
^ implications for colleges 
^ eligibility of students to be seen in the &name and referral systems remain unchanged . 
^ the ? 
^ &num system ? 
^ is also unchanged , though we anticipate that overall requests for &num funding will be more modest than in recent years . 
^ we will be evaluating our new ways of working . 
^ if there are any students to whom we cannot offer sufficient help within the proposed framework , we will work with the student and his / her tutor to put in place an appropriate ? 
^ package ? 
^ of support with the &name as a part .
