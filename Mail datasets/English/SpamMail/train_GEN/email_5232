^ im writing this to see if anyone would have any ideas to how one should go about spreading the word of go around a town / city . 
^ there is a small go club started but we need more people to come along , even if its just to see what go is about . 
^ the vast majority of people would never of known that go even existed and i need a way how i could try to spead this and gain new attention from players and non players alike , are there any suggestions

^ i think there are &num problems - one is making sure that people who have heard of go ( there may well be more than you think ) can find your club , and the second is attracting new players who have n't heard of the game . 
^ so i think it is essential to get the club listed on any local registers of community information or websites about local activities ( libraries and local newspapers often have some sort of listing of local clubs etc. which it is useful to be listed on ; and there are usually some websites of local activities which are only too happy to add a link to a club website ) . 
^ in terms of attracting new players to the game , there are many things we have tried here in &name . 
^ some have been more successful than others . 
^ here are some that i can think of : 
^ * if the town / city has a university , then they generally have an event at the start of the academic year for university clubs / societies to attract new members . 
^ non-university clubs / societies can sometimes take part , especially if you have a member from the university . 
^ these events seem good value for attracting new members . 
^ * we have organised demonstrations of go in the local library , a bookshop , and a shopping centre . 
^ i think these all basically cost us nothing - all we had to do was ask . 
^ * we have participated in &name / japanese / chinese events / fairs etc. in &name 
^ * if you meet in a place suitable for juniors , there are various way to attract junior members . 
^ &name is introducing more and more juniors to the game and may already have visited schools near you . 
^ it may also be possible , for example , to have a go stall at a local junior chess tournament . 
^ * for a while in &name we ran an evening class in go , which attracted some new players . 
^ * there will be some places where it is particularly useful to have posters / leaflets about your club ( e.g. games shops , if there are any in your town / city ) . 
^ i 'm sure other people will have better ideas , and examples of things that have worked well for them !
