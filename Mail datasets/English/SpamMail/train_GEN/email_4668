^ but the tokeniser shld only be applied to the text : e.g ( text ) ... 
^ ( text ) or whatever , where ... is ascii laid out just as it is in the emails minus any )s etc inserted by the mail program 
^ so this ca n't be the output of the tokeniser : ( &name ) text ( &num ) ( tag2 ) 
^ a line of text a line of text ( &num ) ( tag3 ) text ( &num )

^ yes , i deliberately rigged this example to show that the tagger does not require an 
^ to tag a line ( as i had previously thought ) . 
^ i guess i do n't really need to keep the line breaks between tags , although i have run into word buffer overruns if there are many contiguous &name lines . 
^ either way i can work around it using scripts . 
^ i think the easiest way to deal with the last xml line bug is to simply print a 
^ at the end of the file . 
^ in fact i have found that all lines after the last line of non-xml will be dropped if this is not done . 
^ i have got it working satisfactorily now i think ! 
^ &name &name ,
