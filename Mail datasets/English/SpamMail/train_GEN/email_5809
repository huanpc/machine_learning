^ i can do . 
^ &name : how do you react to this ? 
^ realistically i do n't think we can get more before saturday . 
^ we can either &num ) use the &num we have or &num ) make some of our own . 
^ what do you want to do ?

<text_normal> 

^ i think there may be a possibility that &name &name may have some more in his room . 
^ perhaps , &name , you could let us know when you get this how many you have , if indeed you have any . 
^ also , &name , could you let me know if you have a little stash of blue witness cafe cards which we think were with the pencils which you have now returned . 
^ thanks , &name

^ hi all ! 
^ the &name passion guys would like &num gospels ( i think ) to put out on seats . 
^ &num ) who has the leftover &num at the moment ? 
^ &num ) how many are there ? 
^ &num ) ( &name guys ) : &name is not in a financial position to let you have them for nothing . 
^ have you worked out with &name who is paying for them ? 
^ &num ) can whoever has them give them to me so i can give them to &name &name , or to &name personally if that would be more convenient for you . 
^ &num ) can whoever replies to this please 'reply to all " so we all know what 's going on . 
^ many thanks . 
^ with prayers for the event ( and more importantly for the people living in darkness who will be coming to it ) , 
^ &name
