^ i can think of a couple of counter points ... each category should remember the last selected item , so you should n't have to fumble more than once . 
^ alternatively , we could offer paper size as an option in the third panel . 
^ but this would be an annoyance for most , and simply removing the size picking makes it unclear for first timers and annoying for travellers . ... 
^ * shrug * it is a minor point . 
^ i wo n't fight until death about it and your arguments are valid . 
^ the best long term solution would be for our " bloated " applications 
^ like &name , &name to have a first-time wizard to choose the basic configuration options ( size of the paper , default template , default fonts , 
^ plugins , etc. .. ) . 
^ it would cut the complexity for basic users . 
^ makes sense ... what do you think about embedding the new open widget right inside the main window ?
