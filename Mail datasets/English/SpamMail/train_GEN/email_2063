^ just to be predictable : how 's it going ? ^ i have had a very exciting last few days , and am totally discomknockerated as a result . ^ you may not have come accross this wonderful word before , but let me assure you that , serpite not being present in a dictionary , it jolly well should be as it is a great descriptive word meaning that one is extremely tired ( both physically and mentally ) . ^ it also sums up a person 's state of mind : basically meaning that one is feeling rather out of it and , in a word , dopey . ^ the reason for this is pretty plain : we have just lost a  ame . ^ it is a bit crazy to think that there are only  um  ame girls left now . ^  ame is now an  ame - i think  ame sounds much better ! ^ let me tell you the tale of the last few days . ^ i 'll start with wednesday , as that was when the wedding prepartations really hotted up . ^ well , we spent the day organising stuff in the house and i printed out the final drafts of the wedding service sheets which i made . ^ we had a rehersal in the church at about 4pm . ^  ame and i decided to be difficult and insist that we sat down during the vows . ^  ame had this idea that all the bridesmaids should stand for that part , and i insisted that i 'd have none of it . ^  ame 's family immediately , and rather unjustly ( ! ) , put me down as being the bossy and difficult memeber of the family . ^ let me assure you that i later managed to change their opinion . ^ as we know , first impressions can be very deceptive . ... ^ anyway , after the rehersal , me , mam and  ame took the wedding cake and flowers to  ame hall where the reception was to take place . ^ we spent  um hours sorting out the big banqueting room and decorating it , very tastefully i must say , with flowers . ^ the cake was the daft part . ^ you may not be accustomed as to how a wedding cake is assembled . ^ let me explain . ^ are you sitting comfortably ? ^ then i 'll begin : we had a  um tiered wedding cake to assemble . ^ each cake was to be held above the lower one by means of  um plastic pillars . ^ these pillars cannot just be put directly on top of the cakes as the weight of the higher tiers would cause the pillars to sink into the icing and possibly crack it . ^ ultimately , the cake would just collapse . ^ as you can imagine , that is highly undesireable . ^ so , you are supplied with some plastic dowling rods which you stick into the cake and they go up the inside of the pillars and support the cake above . ^ are you getting this ? ^ it 's rather hard to explain ! ^ anyway , the stupid manufacturers do n't use their common sense and provide these plastic rods at the right length . ^ instead , they are several inches too long . ^ as a result , i had to saw them to the right length , and this is a rather difficult task with only  um blunt knife ! ^ anyway , in the end , i managed , and the cake piled up very nicely and looked quite elegant when we put the floral arrangement on top . ^ after that , we went home and had tea ( at 9.30pm would you believe ! ) and then i went out and spent an hour washing the car so that it would look spanking for the wedding . ^ then i flopped into bed and slept like a log ( quite literally ! ) until thursday morning . ^ well , i spent the morning trying not to get excited , and succeeded to a certain degree by making the hoovering of the car a major task . ^ you would not believe ( actually , you probably would ) how flithy the inside of our car was . ^ well , it 's well spanking now . ^ at 1pm the real excitement began . ^ the wedding service was at 3pm , but we had to be realy by  um as the photographer was coming then . ^ well , the house went mad ( well , the people in the house did anyway ) , and we eventually emerged - decked in our fancy geegore ( another well-used word , from the  ame household , that merits dictionary status ) and clutching bouqets of flowers . ^ oh it was great stuff , i can tell you . ^ although i say it myself , we made the most delightful bridesmaids , and  ame looked lush in her dress . ^  ame , you probably do n't want to hear all of this . ^ it 's not in the least bit amusing , jsut  ame waffle i 'm afraid . ^ anyway , at  um ( i insisted we had to be late ! ) we went into church . ^ dad walked  ame in an then turned round and performed the ceremony . ^  ame ended up hardly being able to say her vows as she was crying . ^ it all got a bit too emotional at the front . ^  ame said his vows , and  ame got so emotional about the whole thing that she started laughing ans crying at the same time . ^ dad had a hard time trying not to join in , and had to somehow extract the words from  ame while she was in this quietly hysterical state . ^  ame went the whole hog and joined in the blubbing . ^ call me heartless , but i felt no inclination whatsoever to cry , so sat there feeling rather sorry for them all . ^ however , they managed to compose themselves and the service proceeded without another hitch . ^ one of our church friends filmed the whole thing , so it should be rather amusing watching the replay ! ^  ame vows she will never watch it as she was so embarrassed afterwards . ^ anyway , after the service , the trying part of the day began : photographs . ^ oh i really do n't like having photos taken , and to have to pose for  um people to take pictures of you is highly undesireable . ^ i found it rather difficult being an item of attention all day . ^ however , i ca n't complain , as it was real fun . ^ we then all piled into cars and travelled the  um miles to  ame hall . ^ it is a big posh country house which is set in a huge parkland . ^ quite exquisite . ^ it felt like we were in "  ame and prejudice " land , although you may not appreciate what that means if you have n't sen that marvelous film . ^ ( by the way , if you have n't seen it , you should ) . ^ we had loads more photos there in the gardens , and then had to greet everyone as they went in to the fining room for the reception . ^ the food was scrummy - none of this inedible fancy  ame which is often dished up at such events . ^ it was all to do with the fact that dad likes proper english dinners and none of this foreign fancy stuff . ^ i rather take after dad in my eating tastes , so thourally enjoyed the meal - although i felt rather bloated afterwards ! ^ the speeches which followed were also very emotionally intense . ^ during dad 's speech both  ame and  ame began to blubber again , and when he finished he promptly sat down and wept . ^ all rather shocking as i have never seen him cry before . ^ oh dear . ^ it all got a bit too overwhelming for him i think . ^ the evning was finished off with the cutting of the cake and then general chatter amoung the guests . ^ it was the most amazing day . ^ the experience of having most of our friends and relatives together in the same place at the same time was so wierd - in a nice sort of way . ^ i just loved it , and the memory of that day will stay with me for ever . ^ all the excitement has been too much for me though , and as i mentioned before , i have spent the last  um days in a bit of a daze and feeling like a zombie . ^  ame ! ^ i 've just looked back over all this and i really have waffled this time ! ^ now , let me get onto different subjects . ^ i 'm glad you liked my last e-mail . ^ my apologies that this one will dismally fail to live up to it 's standards : i am not feeling sharp or quick enough to be funny or witty , i 'm afraid . ^ so , who is it that you 're going on  ame camp with ? ^ as to the  ame situation : since when have i been " heading the section detailed to locate the renegade raven " ? ? ? ? ? ? ^ i really should be informed of such appointments you know ! ^ also , how dare you quote me out of context - which you seem to do pretty often ! ^ has  ame shed any more light on the subject yet ? ^ he has not been very communicative this week - i guess he 's been pretty busy with work , so i have nothing to report . ^ "  ame hates pigeons </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ too . ^ however , his eyes burn with laser-like beams which harry them as they fly , sizzling their feathers and dismembering their spleens . " - how do you know ? ? ? ? ^ you do not possess  ame 's ability to telepathically communicate with the creature , so , unless you have been reliably informed by our pastor , which i am rather doubtful about , i can only assume that you are making wild guesses and making things up . ^ however , i do hope that  ame does feel this way , as i would like to think that i possess the same sentiments as a being from another dimension ( ! ) . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ " i bet you wish you had laser-like beams in your eyes . </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ although , i do n't think you 'd be too safe to be around some of the time " - no , i do n't wish for such eyes actually . ^ such eyes are reserved for only  ame ( i think that 's where you got the idea from in the first place : oh  ame really ! ^ you must try and be a bit more original ! ^  ame , no offence ! ^ i am just a bit of a superman expert and feel that his unique qualities should not be copied in others ) . ^  ame i ever tell you before that i am a superman fan ? ? ^ i am really into him , and just love the new adventures of superman . ^ i have about  um episodes on video here at home ! ^ yes , i think i 've told you all this before . ... so moving on . . ... ^ this wedding has made me determine that mine will be a nice simple affair . ^ well , grammatical princess , have you abdicated ? ^ what you just wrote was that you determine (  har ) that your wedding will be a nice simple affair . ^ in other words , you found out that etc. i.e. somehow you have found out what was going to happen in the future . ^  ame dodgy . ^ - oh , stop being pinnickity ! ! ^ ( another  ame ! ) </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ well , i have really waffled on for far too long now : bet you do n't disagree this time ! ^ let me know about when you come down to  ame . ^ if i have not found a job by then i will probably go through to  ame and meet up with you - something to do ! ^ i really want to check out my flat a bit more and get more of an idea what stuff i should take back with me . ^ well , i really am going to sign off this time . ^ hope you have a nice weekend . ^ bye for now , from the " epitomy of  ame " the grammatical princess . ^ ( otherwise known as  ame ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame ( that 's  ame  ame , as you may have guessed : he 's a cheesy smoothie ! ) ,  ame miss  ame , or the  ame  ame ( that 's  ame : our dresses were gold , you see ! ) ) . ^  ame : " by the way , have you told </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ any of your family about  ame ? ^ ( except from your sister  ame ) " ^ - no , i ai n't! ^ they would think i was mad associating with people whi talk about such things ! ^ also , you commited an unforgivable ( in the  ame of  ame  ame style ) sin of spelling my sister 's name with a "  har " ! ^ it is , was and always shall be spelt with an " ie " . ^ however , you are allowed to shorten her name to  ame . ^ that is allowed . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ ( this thing has to be getting on for  um words - no that i 'm counting ! ) get your private , free e-mail from  ame  ame at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
