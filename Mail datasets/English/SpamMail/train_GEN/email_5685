^ dear &name 
^ the college is talking of converting &name ( the 60's building that houses the bar and 1st year rooms above ) so that all the rooms become en suite - for conference facilities i believe . 
^ there is talk of using the present outdoor balcony as a new room ( it is roughly above the bar area and a similar size ) for student use . 
^ the &name president &name &name is putting together a series of proposals for this room and has asked for graduate input . 
^ the current suggestions from the undergraduates are as follows : 
^ &num &name room / &name room ( to be used by us for large events such as &name &name , after grad guest nights)/entertainment room ( extension to the bar area at &name ) / equip it with audiovisual equipment this is given a &num / &num desirability rating 
^ &num fitness suite - create a really good fitness suite with better equipment than we have at present desirability - &num / &num 
^ &num arts suite - the room could be used for music and arts . 
^ if the room is converted to a fitness suite the present gym could be used for arts studios . 
^ desirability - &num / &num 
^ we ( the committee ) will put together views from the &name on saturday evening . 
^ if you have any ideas or thoughts regarding the possibilities for this room please email me and we will put them in with our proposals . 
^ the &name will then be approached with a combined &name / &name document at council . 
^ it would be great to have some input ! 
^ thanks &name &name &name &name president &name &name college &name &name &name 
^ t: &num &num 
^ m: &num &num
