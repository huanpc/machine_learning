^ hey everybody , 
^ i wo n't be able to make the meal tomorrow night for a good reason : it is ( was ? ) my birthday on sunday , and myself and &num friends whose birthdays are also nigh are having a party tomorrow night . 
^ it 's in &name grad bar , which is dead easy to get to , and you are very welcome to come along after the meal if you fancy it . 
^ ( the theme , which is not of my choosing , is " pimps and hos " , but given that i do n't intend to adhere to the dress code that implies , neither should you ) . 
^ anyway , see you there if you come , otherwise , have a very good evening .
