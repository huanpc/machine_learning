^ wherever - if the weather 's nice ( possible - see &website walk , but otherwise i guess it 's &name or &name , whichever you 'd prefer

^ we 'll have to meet somewhere ... i 'll be coming from student lunch so shall we say &name ? 
^ if i just go straight to your room then we could stay there if the weather 's horrible or i could drop my violin off there if we decide to walk- hope that makes sense ? 
^ let me know if this works for you ... see you soon &smiley love &name

^ hi &name , &name you 're having a good week , sorry it 's taken me so long to get back to you- feeling rather 'swamped " at the moment and very behind on emails ... well i seem to have so much stuff today and so much to fit in before the weekend that i do n't really think i can do today any more ... 
^ so that leaves saturday- unless sunday afternoon is any good to you ? 
^ i know i 'd feel a lot less rushed on sunday , as that 's my day off anyway , but if you 'd prefer saturday then lunch could work ... 
^ sorry to be brief , must go now ... 
^ take care , love &name
