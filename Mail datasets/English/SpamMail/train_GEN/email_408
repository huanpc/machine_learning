^ hi &name ! 
^ " it 's nearly christmas , and although &name and nicety pervades the land , it stops at our front door , so i feel free to insult you . 
^ - &name and nicety does not pervade this land . 
^ i do n't know anything about your front door , but that sounds highly likely . 
^ " yes , &name and &name are hyper-christians . 
^ ( i feel so unworthy ) . 
^ - are you being honestly serious here ? 
^ " you are different because i do n't think you are easily shocked . 
^ at least , having a poker face , you do n't show it . 
^ - i may not be easily shocked , but that was quite an insult . 
^ do i honestly have a poker face ? 
^ i 'm in despair . 
^ " it [ mess ] disturbs and distracts me . 
^ - that 's exactly the way i feel about mess too . 
^ " i am sorry about whispering . 
^ it was very rude , and i 'm sorry . 
^ - that 's quite alright . 
^ i was n't saying you ought n't to have . 
^ &name and i whispered too , as did yourself and &name 
^ " i am not having a party . 
^ i just invited everyone to my house knowing that most people would n't be able to come . 
^ &name and &name &name and &name are coming though . 
^ you are missing out on my favourite foods they are expensive , ha ha ha . 
^ - oh , i see . 
^ i 'm glad some of your friends will be there for your birthday . 
^ i deeply regret missing out on your favourite foods , and the fact that they are expensive goes without saying really , does n't it ? 
^ " happy christmas , sweet &name , may your blessings be plentiful in the new year . 
^ - why , thank you &name ! 
^ incidentally , did you know that &name and i now only communicate through his lawyer , a 'mr &name ? 
^ here is the last e-mail i received from him 
^ &name &name esq. , 
^ as mr. &name 's lawyer , i assure you that you are , how shall i put it in the soup . 
^ frankly , you are a very unwise young man to have crossed my client . 
^ you have dealt in an immature manner , and will be dealt with accordingly . 
^ you may be assured that you will be sued to the full extent of the law , and will probably never see your homeland again . 
^ ( you can expect to be deported as a slave to &name . ) 
^ oh yes , mr. &name , you have played with fire , and now you 're going to get burned ( or burrrrrrrrned , as you would say ) . 
^ you have unfortunately messed with one of the most important personages in the country ( in the form of my client ) , and i do n't get paid &pound; &num an hour to fool around in other words , your life as you know it is about to be terminated . 
^ so there 's the good news mr. &name . 
^ the bad news is that my people ( thugs / mercenaries some might call them ) will be round shortly to un-tuck your bed-sheet . 
^ yes it 's true mr. &name , i 'm afraid there is no easy way to break this kind of news . 
^ so , until we meet face to face ( probably in the dock ) let me wish you a happy future . 
^ &name , 
^ mr. &name 
^ quite interesting , do you agree ? 
^ well , i have been wrapping christmas presents this evening . 
^ oh my , time flies too quickly , it 's christmas once again . 
^ i shall now go and do some photo-manipulation . 
^ see you , 
^ &name 
^ &name are you looking forward to your birthday ? 
^ &num is a very old age to be . 
^ i ca n't imagine being that old seriously . 
^ you will no longer be a teenager , how tragic .
