<text_embedded> 

^ actually it avoids confusion . 
</text_embedded>

^ what about &name , &name , &name , and kinput ? 
^ they all sound like &name applications , but are not . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ do n't know these - however , even though exceptions of course exist ( the only one i can think of right now is " kill " ) , i think you have to admit that on &name , if an app starts with a &char , the chance that it 's a &name app is quite high . 
</text_normal>

<text_embedded> 

^ that is exactly the point . 
^ &name is releated to &name - it has the same function . 
</text_embedded>

^ first , &name 's word processor is called word , not &name ( even though the executable might still be called that , which was done to avoid conflict with the &name version of word unless i 'm mistaken ) . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ but do n't have exactly this situation on &name where we have &name programs , command line programs and programs using other toolkits ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ and even if they are both word processors , i do n't think it benefits a non-technical user to believe &name is word . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i do n't think anybody thinks that &name is &name &name , i think the naming suggests that &name is * like * &name word - which is &name &num correct . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name 's gear menu contains names like " &name ( &name processing ) " and " &name ( mail client ) " , so perhaps &num simple possibility would be an option in the control center that lets the user choose to only display the ( slightly modified ) descriptive strings , like " word processor " , 'mail client " , and so on . 
^ the title bar would still be an issue , but maybe this too could be changed in a similar manner ? 
^ i 'm not familiar enough with &name programming to know how feasible this would be . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ so when a newbie has a problem he will just enter " word processor " instead of " kword " into &name and will get millions of junk results . 
^ the k-names are perfect . 
^ they are specific , they are unique , they are descriptive and they are searchable . 
^ i do n't follow your argumentation how that can cause confusion . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ if it is feasible , it would hopefully address both potential confusion among newbies , and developers " need to feel part of the &name community , as mentioned by &name &name . 
^ but it 's just my &num cents . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ actually , you would have to delete the application name in the title bar , in the help system , in the " about " popup and in many other places as well . 
^ of course we would see thousands of users complaining about things in applications they do n't know the name of . 
^ &name 
^ as far as we know , our computer has never had an undetected error .
