^ far away in the tropical waters of the &name , &num prawns were swimming around in the sea - one called &name and the other called christian . 
^ the prawns were constantly being harassed and threatened by sharks that patrolled the area . 
^ finally &num day &name said to christian , " i 'm bored and frustrated at being a prawn , i wish i was a shark , then i would n't have any worries about being eaten ... " 
^ as &name had his mind firmly on becoming a predator , a mysterious cod appears and says , " your wish is granted " , and &name and behold , &name turned into a shark . 
^ horrified , christian immediately swam away , afraid of being eaten by his old mate . 
^ time went on ( as it invariably does ... ) and &name found himself becoming bored and lonely as a shark . 
^ all his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them . 
^ &name did n't realise that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight . 
^ while out swimming alone &num day he sees the mysterious cod again and ca n't believe his luck . 
^ &name figured that the fish could change him back into a prawn . 
^ he begs the cod to change him back so , &name and behold , he is turned back into a prawn . 
^ with tears of joy in his tiny little eyes , &name swam back to his friends . 
^ looking around the gathering at the reef , he searched for his old pal . 
^ " where 's christian ? " he asked . 
^ " he 's at home , distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark " , came the reply . 
^ eager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture , he set off to &name 's house . 
^ as he opened the coral gate the memories came flooding back . 
^ he banged on the door and shouted , " it 's me , &name , your old friend , come out and see me again . 
^ " christian replied " no way man , you 'll eat me . 
^ you 're a shark , the enemy and i 'll not be tricked . 
^ " &name cried back " no , i 'm not . 
^ that was the old me . 
^ i 've changed . " ... 
^ ( wait for it ) . 
^ . 
^ . 
^ . ... " i 've found cod , i 'm a prawn again , &name " .
