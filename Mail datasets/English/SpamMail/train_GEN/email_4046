^ dear &name 
^ thanks for keeping in touch , and i 'll certainly pray for you in your exams . 
^ i hope they ask you all the things you want to tell them about ! 
^ last week i gave a seminar at &name which i 've been preparing since last &name . 
^ it counts for &num of my ma , so it was pretty important . 
^ i felt &name really helped me get it together , and all the audio and video technology i used actually worked , so i was very pleased about that . 
^ i 've now completed exactly half of my ma , and if i can finish &num compositions by september , that will be &num ( and all the taught part ) done . 
^ i 'm glad you had such a good time with the canadian guy very good pre-exam therapy i 'm sure ! 
^ stick with the revision , it 'll be worth it . 
^ all the best , &name
