^ hi , &name , thanks for your email . 
^ re : " prayer points " -- fallout from &name 11th is obviously a biggie . 
^ so many people in &name and the &name sought out churches in the days and weeks following . 
^ i pray that the seeds sown in the hearts of those who had n't 'darkened the door " of a church for years would ripen . 
^ there has also been a groundswell of interest in and concern for muslims . 
^ christians have visited mosques and heard talks about islam ( including folks at our church ) . 
^ groups in the community who have not interacted before are writing to each other , visiting each other 's places of worship and inviting speakers to share about their religion . 
^ frankly , i see it as one of the very few " good " things to come out of all the horribleness . 
^ i hope that these lines of communication can remain open . 
^ and i 'd also pray that justice and peace rather than vengeance could prevail . 
^ i think i 'll include something that was sent to me through alternatives for simple living , an american christian organization i 've been connected with for years . 
^ i think you might find it interesting and even personally challenging . 
^ on a more personal note , i 'm intrigued to see your assortment of professional ideas -- naval officer really ? ? ? ? 
^ just remember that many people shift professions a few times in the course of their lives ( professions not just jobs ! ) , so you may be able to try out a couple of those ideas . 
^ we 'll keep praying that you have a real sense of where &name would like you to use your many gifts . 
^ ( by the way , have you ever seen the book , " what color is your parachute ? " it 's an excellent career-assessment tool which you might find helpful . ) take care and keep in touch &name , &name and the gang &smiley &char faith-based response to the events of september &num & beyond from the institute for peace and justice 
^ so many words have been written and spoken these past few days . 
^ our concern , as a community of faith , is based on &num precepts . 
^ first , our institute was founded on the precept , " if you want peace , work for justice . " and secondly , consistent with the precepts of all the great religions , " in the face of escalating violence , escalate love . " 
^ &num . 
^ &name as the basis of our nation 's response . 
^ the terrible evil inflicted on us as a people must be righted according to the basic principles of international law . 
^ our nation has a unique opportunity to enlist the resources and good will of all the peoples of the world in a global effort to combat the terrorism that threatens all of us . 
^ &org is the appropriate channel for such an all-out global search for the terrorists . 
^ as enticing as it is to want to punish the perpetrators and anyone remotely associated or geographically near them with a massive military response -- an all-out war -- this will only add fuel to the spiral of violence that is behind these terrible deeds . 
^ we will become the evil we want to eradicate . 
^ &num . 
^ justice demands that we address the roots of these terrorist deeds . 
^ as unpleasant and unpopular as it is to be saying such things , the evil that we are striking out against is partly our own doing . 
^ &name , as ugly and unjustified as it is , nevertheless comes from some long-standing injustices . 
^ we must look at the ways we have unjustly treated peoples and nations for &num centuries -- see the " beam " in our own eyes -- to understand where such violence came from . 
^ unless we are willing to address the on-going humiliation of the palestinian people , the &num years of horrendous suffering by the people of &name , and the widening gap between rich and poor nations , we will not get at the roots of terrorism and the spiral of violence will only escalate . 
^ if we want peace , we must work for justice -- not vigilante justice , but justice based on the rule of law and the precepts of our faith traditions . 
^ &num . 
^ " in the face of escalating violence , escalate love . " while we address these evil deeds directly , we can also address them indirectly . 
^ as all the great faith traditions have emphasized , the spirit of violence , the spirit of evil , can only be overcome by the spirit of love . 
^ as &name lived and preached , " we must become the change we wish to see in this world . " the pledge of nonviolence gives all of us a concrete way of overcoming the evil spirit behind the deeds of september &num and those being considered as a way of retaliating . 
^ for those of us who are christian , the words and tears of &name as he looked out over his beloved city of &name are particularly poignant , " &name , &name , if only today you knew the things that make for peace " ( &name &num : &num ) . 
^ he weeps again today , over the middle east , over the united states , over the &name , and so many other places , pleading with each of us to 'do the things that make for peace . " practically , how can we escalate love ? 
^ &char . 
^ respect self and others . 
^ in the face of escalating words of hate , we can escalate our words of kindness toward others -- in check-out lines , on the street , driving , being extra patient with one another . 
^ b. communicate better & listen carefully . 
^ in the face of escalating anger , especially if the anger is directed at us in some way , we can escalate our willingness to listen non-defensively and acknowledge the deep hurts and fears that underlie a lot of this anger and not respond in kind . 
^ &char . 
^ &name . 
^ in the face of escalating cries for revenge , we can escalate our willingness to become more forgiving toward anyone with whom we have some issues . 
^ d. act &name . 
^ in the face of escalating acts of hate directed at muslim and arab people and others , we can escalate our courage and stand by them , protest , perhaps even accompany them in places where they feel afraid . 
^ we can pray with them daily and especially on fridays , their sacred day of prayer . 
^ and in the face of escalating cries for war , we can courageously and lovingly offer a different perspective .

^ dear &name , &name , &name , uncle &name and &name ( phew ! ) 
^ as one of my ( many ) activities here in &name , i 've agreed to lead a &name american prayer group this year , which basically is a chance for all of us brits with an intrest in or connection with &name &name to get together and prayer for issues in the states and &name at this time . 
^ i was wondering if , as you all live in the aformentioned countries and know first hand the things that are going on , both good and bad , local and nationally , you would be willing to suggest particular " prayer points " for lack of a better name . 
^ i do believe in the power of prayer , and so if there is anything at all that you want prayer for , i 'd love to know . 
^ on a less cu note , i 'm very much back into the swing of things here at college . 
^ i can hardly believe that this time next year i 'll be out into the real world , or some version of it . 
^ my mind has been flicking between different jobs recently ... teaching , &name , navy officer , and the most recent one is a graphic designer , which actally really appeals to me . 
^ we 'll see what happens . 
^ my dissertation ( thesis ) deadline is coming close , so the work on that is really stepping up . 
^ i basically finished my map today , and now all that need to be done is colouring it in. it is very large , about 100cm &char &num cm , so that will take a bit of time . 
^ still , i can do it in sections inbetween trying to work out weird &num dimensional tapering outs of rocks ... 
^ gotta go , 
^ lots of love ,
