^ hi &name , 
^ i 'm guessing the general paper that &name is talking about is the one that you have to give to me - what 's the best way to do this ? 
^ will you photocopy it , or do you not need it anymore ? 
^ cheers , 
^ &name 
^ /usr / groups / corpora / reuters -- you can see the &name marked up texts there -- &char / you 'll be able to parse the ( text ) ... ( /text ) preserving the metadata info on coding etc 
^ &num bits of info i have on the dataset are : 
^ &num ) a general paper establishing baseline results for a variety of term-based classifiers which shows a strong correlation btwn amount of training data and f1-meas ( this is unpublished and not on the web -- i 'll give &name a copy for you to share tomorrow ) 
^ &num ) &name &name 's &name diss . 
^ from last year ( i 'll also lend this to &name tomorrow , if we have n't got it on the web in a public place by then ) -- he chose &name , &name , &name , &name and &name as a set of &num fine-grained markets " related topics . 
^ he also chose some &num course- and &num medium-grained classes . 
^ ( i 'm not sure how much he defined these in terms of word overlap , the &name class hierarchy , or just intuitively . ) he chose classes with at least 3k documents / class to concentrate on issues of class discrimination rather than adequacy of training data . 
^ i 'd like to parse the &name " data you wld like to work with for you during the &name break , so coming to some conclusions about which bit to work with wld be useful -- i do n't want to parse and store all 800k files ( yet ) .
