^ dear &name , 
^ i hope everyone has survived their exams and that you 're all starting to ponder the delights of may week ! 
^ this is the point at which we wave our magic wand over the &name &name and bring the choir out of its suspended animation now that exam period is drawing to a close . 
^ please read to the end of this message so you do n't miss any important instructions ! 
^ i 'm pleased to say that both the &name and the music society have cleared our end-of-term plans . 
^ here is the diary run-down ... 
^ [ venue for all items : &name college chapel ] 
^ mon &num june - rehearsal &num * * tomorrow - please come! * * &name &num june - rehearsal &num mon &num june - rehearsal &num &name &num june - run-through circa &num , concert circa &num hrs ( finishing by &num ) . 
^ as a free-standing addition to the above , there is also still the possibility of a madrigal-type outdoor concert in &name grounds sometime during may week , which may or may not be linked to one of the various garden parties that are happening . 
^ this would have just &num rehearsal on the day of the performance . 
^ * * action on your part * * 
^ - please let me know whether or not you can perform with us on &num june . 
^ ( it is important that i know what numbers to expect so that i can draft in reinforcements if necessary . ) 
^ - if you can sing in the concert , please let me know whether there are any rehearsals you ca n't make . 
^ we have a lot of work still to do , especially on the cantatas , so good turnouts are essential at this stage ! 
^ - you 're welcome to take scores away to practise at home ; this can be arranged through me . 
^ - if you ca n't make the main concert but would still like to sing with us for the outdoor concert ( if that happens ) , please register your interest accordingly . 
^ hope to &name as many of you as possible in chapel for rehearsal this monday at &num &name . 
^ cheers , &name
