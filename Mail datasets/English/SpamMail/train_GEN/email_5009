^ &name timestamp stuff was committed , but , as usual ( sigh ) &name was sent via an email attachment to &name - &name , i fear you unfortunately were n't aware of this " new " &name so check with &name to get a hold of that one , which will solve your " compile " errors , since the predicate parser is also one of the changed modules for precision timestamps . 
^ overnight , both &name and &name were compiling everything fine , so that 's the above is my most educated guess of your problem .
