^ dear students , in a version of last night 's xmlrmrs , the last sentence ws not processed to the end . 
^ &name built in some changes , this is &website again and recompile . 
^ ( then you do n't need &name 's workaround ) . 
^ &name says : 
^ &name this is fixed now . 
^ the behavior of the windows stream library is slightly different then gnu and gnu was returning a fail bit set on a call to getline ( ) with a long line . 
^ &website and xmlrmrs.h 
^ other changes : implemented the &name error handlers so we will get line number information if it detects a malformed &name file or &name . 
^ for the students : &name : : &name ( ) now takes a boolean value . 
^ if false is passed in , it will &name the creation of a &name for that sentence . 
^ this is helpful if you are analyzing a sentence , say [ &num ] and want to &name the others : 
^ a value of true is the normal behavior . 
^ this is set as default so you do not need to change your programs unless you wish to take advantage of this feature .
