" ^ - i 'm sure the kids were too . ^ i hope your dad gets the job he 's being interviewed for . ^ is  ame really going to give you his guitar ? ^ he 's mad ! ^ anyway , now i shall tell you my story ( of the last few days - not my life ) ^ well , as you know , on tuesday i managed to clean most of the flat , including the shower and bathroom . ^ i also walked to the science site to visit the library and show my friend where the  ame department was . ^ in addition to that i defrosted and cleaned our fridge / freezer , and also cleaned my room with the utmost thoroughness . ^ after that i had to pack my room , and as a result of my hectic morning , after busying myself with all this running around , i had to rush frantically to the railway station . ^ i arrived on the platform , much out of breath due to the rather weighty nature of my bags , to see the train pulling out of the station . ^ my heart sank , as the next train was not due for at least an hour . ^ thankfully it was not my train , which had been delayed by the ineptitude of  ame by  um minutes . ^ this was  um time when i was thankful for inefficiency . ^ eventually my train arrived and i embarked upon my journey , sad to leave  ame . ^ my train was then delayed by vandalising children ( kids again ! ) on the railway track . ^ i arrived in  ame over  um minutes late , but still in  um piece and much calmer than i had been while rushing to try and catch my train . ^ how is your ear ? ^ i thought the blood contrasted beautifully with your pale complexion . ^ anyway , are you well ? ^ i hope you get over your tiredness soon . ^  um days ago i was in the middle of a power cut . ^ at  um :  ame i was gaily about to check my e-mail , when the computer switched off and i was plunged into darkness . ^ we proceeded to eat our dinner by the light of hurricane lamps . ^ we lit our fire and  um the played the piano by candlelight for half an hour . ^ it was very beautiful , but could get boring quite easily . ^ i then went up to my room , oil lamp in hand , and began to study . ^ at 8pm the electricity came back on and i succeeded in checking my e-mail . ^ i 'll write again soon . ^  ame ^  ame  ame 's unwell . ^ i quote from  ame "  ame is having problems of  har , how shall i say , personal nature . ^ i wonder if she has some deep psychological problem that she is n't telling me about . " ^ please could you send her a get well card . ^ i am , and  ame and  ame might . ^ it would be really amusing if  ame got all these get well cards for his computer ! ^  ame 's address is ^  um  ame road  ame park  ame  ame 3pt </text_normal></message_body></message>
