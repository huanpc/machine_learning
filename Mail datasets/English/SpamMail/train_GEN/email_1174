" so the next sunday he took the monsignor 's advice . ^ at the beginning of the sermon , he got nervous and took a drink . ^ he proceeded to talk up a storm . ^ upon his return to his office after mass , he found the following note on the door : ^  um sip the vodka , do n't gulp . ^  um there are  um commandments , not  um . ^  um there are  um disciples , not  um . ^  um  ame was consecrated , not constipated . ^  um  ame wagered his donkey , he did not bet his ass . ^  um we do not refer to  ame  ame as the late j.c. ^  um the father ,  ame , and  ame ghost are not referred to as daddy , junior and the spook . ^  um  ame slew  ame , he did not kick the shit out of him . ^  um when  ame was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey do n't say he was stoned off his ass . ^  um we do not refer to the cross as the "  ame  ame " ^  um when  ame broke the bread at the last supper he said,' take this and eat it for it is my body . " he did not say " eat me . " ^  um the virgin  ame is not called  ame with the  ame , " ^  um the recommended grace before a meal is not : rub-a-dub-dub thanks for the grub ,  ame  ame . ^  um next sunday there will be a  ame pulling contest at  ame  ame 's, not a  ame pulling contest at  ame  ame 's. </text_normal></message_body></message>
