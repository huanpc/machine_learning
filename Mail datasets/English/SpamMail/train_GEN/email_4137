^ dear &name , &name , &name and &name , 
^ in memoriam ... of the times we had in &name &char all those many &num years ago ... i would like to invite you to relive the experience .

^ i 'm sure this will be unsuitable for someone , if not everyone , but it will start the ball rolling . 
^ i have n't mentioned it to &name yet &smiley but i guess he 'll be taking his car up via &name , so you might not have to pay train fares if you smile sweetly ( i do n't know what you 'll do , &name ) at &name .
