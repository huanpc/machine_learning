^ dear friends 
^ i would like to cordially invite you to celebrate my 25th birthday with me ! 
^ after you recover from the shock of realisation that i 'm &num ( and probably older than you ) , i 'll admit that i moved the date a bit ( since the real date was in &name ) , but i hope &num will mind . 
^ i 'm guessing that since the term is nearly over , everyone will appreciate the chance to go out and kill themsel- i mean have a good time ... &smiley 
^ the plan starts here : 
^ &name : thursday 13th march &num &name : &num p.m. until &char . 
^ late . 
^ &name : initially , the &name ( &name ) , but we could end up anywhere ... 
^ i hope that you can all make it - everyone is welcome ( and encouraged ) to bring friends - let 's make it a night to remember ... 
^ best wishes 
^ &name
