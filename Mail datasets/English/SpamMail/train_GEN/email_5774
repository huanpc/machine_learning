^ dear mr. &name , 
^ i would like to thank you very much for replying so promptly to my inquiry . 
^ unfortunately , the version of &name &name that i am using cannot be customized , because i operate in a corporate environment that enforces very strict computer security measures ; indeed , the &name features you mention are disabled at the bureau level , and cannot be unlocked by individual users ( features are greyed-out ) . 
^ ; ( 
^ i do however very much appreciate your info on the false-positive response . 
^ for the moment i 'll have to keep waiting for &name to update its next virus definition file , before i can eagerly return to my experiments with &name without constantly triggering false alerts at the security department ... 
^ thank you very much for having created and distributed freely this wonderful utility , and keep up the good work ! 
^ have a great day !

^ i have installed &name a couple of days ago , and have been delighted at the results of my first experiments done with it . 
^ unfortunately however , starting this morning ( may &num , &num ) , the most recent virus definition file from &name ( may &num , &num ) detects the presence of a &website in the output self-extracting executable file ! 
^ &website ( or the directory in which it has been installed ) does not reveal the presence of the virus . 
^ i would very much appreciate a response from you , as i would very much like to use &name in the near future !

^ you could please report this issue to &name &name research center by using the &name and deliver ? 
^ to do this you 'll need to add it to quarantine ( which will probably mean disabling auto-protect temporarily ) and then use &name to &name in quarantine , adding to the comments field that this is a false-positive . 
^ for more info on &name &amp; deliver , please see :
