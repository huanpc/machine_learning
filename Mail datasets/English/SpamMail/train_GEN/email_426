^ dear &name , 
^ i 'm glad you like my e-mails . 
^ i like yours too . 
^ you have lots of allergies ! 
^ i have none , except canadians - kidding . 
^ " &name is rather daft to have trusted &name " 
^ - anyone is rather daft to trust &name , when it comes to directions . 
^ i 'm sure one could make a most amusing comedy series of her travels around the world . 
^ " now &name , your challenge this week is to get from this end of the street to the other - the catch ? 
^ you must use a map . " 
^ what 's a numeracy test ? 
^ is n't that really simple maths questions ? 
^ i hope you passed , but do n't be too disappointed if you did n't, there are plenty other things to do . 
^ and remember , if all else fails , you could marry &name and live in the frozen wilds of &name , cut off from all civilisation . 
^ he would hunt elk and grizzly bears , and you would cook them , with bread-cubes and noodles . 
^ thank you for sending &name an e-greetings card . 
^ i 've posted her a get well card this morning . 
^ it should arrive on monday . 
^ i 'm impressed that you 've been for another run . 
^ i intend to cycle this holiday , but it 's too cold for that so far . 
^ did you enjoy picking up " the genius " ? 
^ are you stiff from your long car journey ? 
^ i 'm impressed that you 're studying . 
^ i have n't got any done today . 
^ however , i did get my hair cut , and i 've spent most of the afternoon painting the bathroom . 
^ i shall work this evening . 
^ do you want to chat online sometime ? 
^ well , i have nothing more of any interest to say . 
^ ( &name this is so short an e-mail ) i sometimes worry about not having anything interesting to write in e-mails . 
^ i 'm working on monday and tuesday next week , so that should be a little bit of a change of scenery . 
^ regarding &name , &name writes as follows 
^ " &name , &name is having problems of &char , how shall i say , personal nature . 
^ i wonder if she has some deep psychological problem that she is n't telling me about . 
^ the other day she just would n't light up , and even though i pumped her switches ( something that usually really gets her going ) i could not turn her on at all ! 
^ and then , after i had delved around her innards for half an hour or so and actually got her to boot up , her time and date settings were &name . 
^ very strange . " 
^ &name is really interesting . 
^ " till this evening my love ( kidding ) 
^ &name
