^ i 'm wondering , do most &name application names really need to start with the letter &char ? 
^ to me , this is the most annoying aspect of an otherwise well-working desktop environment . 
^ while including the letter i can make it easy to spot a &name application , is this feature all that useful ? 
^ and does n't it lead to confusion among newbies when &name applications have names starting with &char anyway ? 
^ in my humble opinion , names like &name and kontour look like an exercise in bad spelling . 
^ do n't misunderstand me , the names themselves are completely okay , but why not spell them with the &char they are supposed to be spelt with ? 
^ currently , this &char naming convention is n't even maintained consistently , for example &name and &name instead of &name and &name ( or &name ? ) . 
^ most names do n't start with a k-sound at all , but get a k thrown in anyway . 
^ why &name instead of node ? 
^ for some applications , removing this i would be a problem though , since the non-k name is in use by other applications on other platforms ( for example &name and &name ) . 
^ based on my own experience , non-technical people tend to think &name is somehow related to &name &name , and get confused and annoyed when it does n't look and behave the same way ( especially with relation to file formats ) . 
^ considering how much time is being spent writing these good and useful applications , would n't it be worth giving it a unique name ? 
^ if i remember correctly , &name was called killustrator until &name took legal action . 
^ comparing the &num names , it is nearly tempting to hope other companies will do the same . 
^ i hope all this does n't sound like flaming or shit throwing , it is really meant to be constructive criticism . 
^ i like the &name desktop a lot , but it could be even better without most of the &name also , my apologies if this issue has been discussed earlier .
