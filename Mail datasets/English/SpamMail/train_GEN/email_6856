^ hello all , 
^ many thanks for your help with reading at chapel services last year ( and before ! ) - it would be great if you were willing to help out with reading in chapel again this year . 
^ the proceedure will be similar to previous years , i 'll e-mail you a week or so before the service to ask if you might be willing to read - if so i 'll pigeonhole the reading a few days before the service . 
^ as a new innovation this year , the &name is holding a short &num / 2-hour workshop on helpful tips , techniques and good practice for reading in chapel . 
^ this will be at 6.50pm on thursday 24th october , in the chapel ( immediately after the thursday evening service ) - you might find it helpful to come along and get a few practical tips on reading in chapel . 
^ all readers and chapel clerks are encouraged to attend this ! 
^ best wishes ,
