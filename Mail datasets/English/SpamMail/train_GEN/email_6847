^ glad to hear you 're ok now- or at least " a bit better on track " &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ i just have to justify to my group tomorrow why i have n't done any work since the weekend on the group project &smiley ... but it 'll be ok . 
^ oh , and then there 's supervision work and going through lecture notes and . ... i 'm here for a degree ? ? ! ! 
^ now they tell me ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ a degree ? ? ? ? 
^ since when ? ! 
^ yep , i know the feeling ... very well ! 
^ but i 'm sure you 're not stressing ... &smiley sorry i have n't been able to help much recently , but do send stuff my way ( gospel issue still being chased up ... did &char forward that message from &name ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

^ was great to see posters up in the &name today ! 
^ i know - it 's a great feeling to see them springing up everywhere ! 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ even found myself being handed flyers at &char & &char this evening &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ i 'm afraid tomorrow 's really no good for me- i 'm rather snowed under at the moment and do n't have many gaps in my day tomorrow anyway ... i might not be able to do much until the weekend ... 
</text_embedded>

^ do n't worry - things are covered as far as i can see ... just keep praying , i think that 's the most important thing . 
^ do n't your work slip behind . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ thanks for doing that today- dorry i could n't help . 
^ as for work- i 've been behind since the beginning of &name ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ as for prayer meetings , ( snip ) 
</text_embedded>

^ after this saturday , we need one more before the day itself . 
^ monday is a bit close . 
^ i cannot do tuesday at all . 
^ wednesday i can do &num - 6.30pm . 
^ thursday i can do before &email & after 2pm ( when i finish selling tickets in &name ) . 
^ friday i 'm free after &name , but you 're not ... i 'll leave that one for you to think about ! 
^ ok . ... i think wednesday would be ok for me , but perhaps not so ideal as everyone will have &name later and might be less likely to be able to come ... thursday would prob be better , i 'm free then too as far as i can tell ... friday 's no go for me- with so few rehearsals there 's no way i can miss it ! 
^ and the same goes for everyone else who 's playing in it . 
^ so , thursday ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ only problem was that i could n't find much free time this week ! 
</text_embedded>

^ &name , i know ... i 'll try to keep things off you 
^ &name but you 're just as busy- if not more so ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ and i 'll chase up the gospel issue too , and see how many they 've got left after witness ... 
</text_embedded>

^ thanks .. but we do n't have any money to buy any . 
^ cf. my e-mail to &name earlier today . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes , but i do n't think we know for certain that there 's no possibility of &name main buying them for the event ? ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ ps- i saw &name yesterday night ( we , together with &name &char , spent almost &num hours bowing parts ... ! ) 
</text_embedded>

^ wow ! 
^ you should have said & i 'd have given you a hand . 
^ many thanks for that . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ well it was mostly a case of all agreeing on sensible bowings for the violin parts- then each marking them in &num part as we went along ... we 've finished copying them in the others now , and &name 's taking care of the other parts which hopefully wo n't need so much work ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ and here 's another instance of &name helping again ... i 've already been asked to promote her up the thanks list as much as possible ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yep- she 's a star ! 
^ and she knows all teh words to everything now , after listening to it non-stop over the long vac ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ and he said the placing of the talks has all been finalised- so hopefully he 'll be able to reply to &name " email about that &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ excellent .. though it 's &name who _really_ needs to know 
^ yep- he ( &name ) knows that . 
<text_embedded> 

^ also all the fixing 's done apart from &num double bass- &name 's reluctant to get the list to &name before it 's completely finished ... but i do see that we originally decided to have the progs completely finalised by tomorrow . ... 
</text_embedded>

^ it would be really helpful if &name could have the list as it stands &name and i can add the double-bass in before it goes to print . 
^ just because adding &num name is something which can easily be done last minute , but putting in a whole list of names is something which is fundamental to the structure . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i 'll ask &name ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ do you think you could ask &name when she 's free to meet &name &name and i 'll then try to arrange a meeting with him . 
^ yep- it 's mornings or after evensong , is n't it ? 
^ i 'll start looking into curry houses as we do n't seem to have managed to arrange for anyone else to sort that out ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ hmmm ... though i could ask &name when &char email her ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ take care and do n't work too hard , 
^ more danger of not working at all at the &name ! 
^ but do n't you work too hard either &smiley love &name love

^ hi &name , 
^ i 'm going to be brief , because i need to get to bed , but just to say sorry i have n't been in contact properly over the last week . 
^ i 've been somewhat snowed under with work and getting progressively more tired and hence i did n't make evening witness things at all or church on sunday " &name i just needed sleep . 
^ anyway , things seem to be a bit better on track now - i just need to watch the work to ensure i do n't let my group down or let supervision work fall behind . 
^ hope you are feeling better than yesterday morning . 
^ do get plenty of rest and let me know if there is anything i can do . 
^ publicity is all in order ( we 've got a great publicity team ! ) . 
^ i 'm doing &name road area on wednesday afternoon if you are able and want to join me . 
^ programmes are coming on ok , once provisions in my e-mail to &name have been sorted . 
^ &name &name started in &name today without any glitches 
^ - once posters go up then we might actually sell some &smiley finances are ok ... see the website for revised budget to accomodate the organ . 
^ could you please chase up the gospel issue ? 
^ i thinks that everythings is generally coming together ! 
^ we need also to sort out a prayer meeting . 
^ my evenings are generally all booked up . 
^ i know this might not be brilliant for you , so feel free to say no , but would it be possible to have one on &name 7th and one on &name 14th after &name 's ( time and venue your choice ) ? 
^ otherwise we 're onto daytime slots .
