^ hey &name , 
^ how is the map box going - i told &name that we were close to getting it working - do you think that is true ? 
^ as we discussed yesterday the &name folks are going to start working on the tumble box , but we will drop anything if you guys need our help in debugging the code we already gave you . 
^ there is &num issue with the tumble box that i realized - it requires that a ton of state is maintained between calls from the scheduler . 
^ &name now , how does it work ? 
^ does a box get recreated every time it is scheduled ? 
^ if that is true , we might have to change this way of thinking for the tumble box . 
^ if you want to call to discuss this , my number at &name is &num .

^ what do n't you have access to ? 
^ you seem to have write permissions everywhere i can see . 
^ &name i fixed the map bug - turns out that we always tested the parser on predicates and there was a bug in the &name method that never got found . 
^ i fixed the bug , but now there is another error later on that the parser does not seem to be causing .
