^ &name , 
^ it was said in the practical discussion the other day that the verb 'rent " was classified as 'rend_rel " in both the lingo and &name &name . 
^ this is in fact not the case - only the &name output gives 'rend_rel " ; the lingo output correctly gives 'rent_rel " . 
^ just a point to note , 
^ cheers , 
^ &name
