^ dear &name , 
^ thanks for your e-mail . 
^ &name is settled in in &name and &name is in &name doing a cartography course , so they are some distance apart . 
^ still they 're engaged ! ! ! ! ! 
^ &name really honoured me by asking me to be his best man , so that will be great . 
^ i am looking forward to it already . 
^ &name is in a little village called silsoe which is about 14km south of &name , and an hour away from &name . 
^ i 'm still commuting , but may go live there . 
^ i do n't know . 
^ had my first day of lectures today &num hours , back to back . 
^ killer . 
^ still it was really interesting . 
^ school is a little better for &name . 
^ he has n't cried yet this year before school , so i guess that is good . 
^ still , kids are annoyingly immature beasts most of the time , and i think they should bring the strap back to school ... ( now that i 'm gone ) 
^ i hear that you are temping on and off . 
^ how is that going ? 
^ i am so pleased to be having something to do again . 
^ it is a great thing . 
^ &name is good to me . 
^ keep well , and in touch . 
^ can you come at new years ? 
^ &name 
^ dear &name , my dunelm thing will now work from tomorrow morning ... sorry ! 
^ &name told me about your ma- i am so pleased for you- i can totally see you doing that , and it makes all your hard work for your first worthwhile ... i have never heard of cranfield- what 's it like ? 
^ and where exactly is it ? 
^ it is really good to see &name blessing you , and how your faithfulness has been rewarded . 
^ i hope &name is well , and that the engaged couple are happy , happy , happy ... how is &name doing at school these days ? 
^ is it easier this year for him ? 
^ i hope so ... ok , i should go . 
^ lots of love , &name xx

^ hey &name , these tywo e-mails got sent back to me . 
^ i 'll try again &name 
^ hello all ! 
^ now that i know for sure what i am going to be doing over the next year , i thought it would be good of me to actually tell you . 
^ i know i 've told some people , but ca n't really remember who , as these last few weeks have been quite crazy . 
^ i am doing a masters course at &name university in &name in geographical information management , which is basically mapping with computers and satellites , so it is pretty good fun , or should be when lectures start on monday . 
^ it is a &num year course , and quite intensive , but very applied , so that suits me just fine . 
^ the people on the course sound really nice , and there is &num christian who i have already identified . 
^ so that is good . 
^ the lecture schedule sounds very crazy with long days , but the material looks very interesting , so that is ok . 
^ i at this time , do not have accommodation sorted out , and so am commuting in to &name ~ ( about an hour away ) . 
^ i have found another girl who is doing the same from &name , and so will probably car-pool with her untill some accommodation can be sorted out . 
^ amazingly enough &name provided the funds ( about &pound; &num ) for me to be able to afford this course , which otherwise , i could n't have done . 
^ i have full funding from the university , which , according to the finance lady who processed my form today , is practically unheard of ! 
^ &name old &name ! 
^ am i incredibly blessed or what ? ! 
^ and this after only applying &num or &num weeks ago ! 
^ the only bad side of this course is being so far away from &name , and more specifically , &name . 
^ i do n't like being so far from her , but i guess this will be good for us - i do n't know why , but everyone says that it will . 
^ &name ! 
^ perhaps they are just being nice . 
^ well , i 'll go now , but i am thinking of you all lots , 
^ &name 
^ hi &name , 
^ new years - &num 
^ how would you like to come down to my house in &name for new years ? 
^ i propose &num nights instead of the normal one , as for people who live furthur away it would be better , and furthur more , we would have more time to catch up with each other after not having seen much of one another for quite some time . 
^ so , &num days before new year ? 
^ &name leaving new years day ? 
^ or the otherway around ? 
^ when you reply , can you relpy to all ( click reply all ( &name &smiley ) so everyone can see what people are thinking . 
^ say 
^ &num ) if you want to come &num ) if you can come &num ) when is best for you 
^ in terms of room , if needs be , i think we can invade &name 's house for some beds . 
^ &name this sounds ok to you . 
^ remember - breakfasts are our specialty ! 
^ &name ! 
^ french toast ! 
^ &name syrup ! 
^ &name ! 
^ you are all great !
