^ dear &name and cums i , 
^ as usual i shall need &num stewards for the &name concert in &name 's on &num december . 
^ preference will be given to students . 
^ they need to be in the chapel by &name and to be prepared to stay at the end to help clear the chapel . 
^ names and e-mails to me please asap . 
^ i also need some offers of help from both chorus and orchestra to set everything up on tuesday 3rd at 6.30pm . 
^ &name and i often end up doing it all ourselves ( as we did on 9th nov ) and i , for one , do n't have the physical strength any more to do that much heaving around of furniture . 
^ ( the sarcoidosis in my lungs does n't respond well to exertion of that kind ! ) . 
^ &num or &num people from each group would make all the difference . 
^ is anyone organising a party after this concert ? 
^ if so the &name room needs to be booked asap . 
^ cheers , &name
