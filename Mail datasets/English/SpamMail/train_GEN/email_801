^ oh most fair and wondrous &name , 
^ here is my address : 
^ &num &name road &name park &name &name 3pt 
^ today i begin my work campaign . 
^ i am not particularly looking forward to it , but i must just get on with it . 
^ miss &name has now left , and therein lies a story : 
^ i was taking her to &name to drop her off with her brother , and she assumed that it would be easy enough to find the place because she knew what it was called - &name halls . 
^ thus , she did not ask for directions , and upon arriving in &name , she realised that it was somewhat bigger than she had expected and we would perhaps not be able to just " find " the place by knowing its name ! 
^ and so , &num people , a number of text messages and an hour later we eventually found our destination ! 
^ anyway , she is there now and i am emailing you from my living room where &name is currently residing . 
^ see you later , 
^ &name
