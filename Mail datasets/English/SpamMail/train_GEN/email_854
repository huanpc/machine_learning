^ hi &name , 
^ what is &name ? 
^ is it an operating system ? 
^ i informed &name and &name of the telephone bill once more . 
^ i arrived back from &name camp yesterday . 
^ &num intense week of abseiling , go-karting , mountain biking , sport , activities , bible study , prayer , music and meetings . 
^ oh , and yes , there were &num &num and &num year olds as well . 
^ children say the most curious things . 
^ i think my &num favourites from this week were " are we allowed to get the dinner plates dirty when we eat ? " and 'do you have to sign a form to become a christian ? " joking aside though , i enjoyed myself and was immensely relieved not to be sharing a dorm with children this time . 
^ consequently i enjoyed a much more respectable &num or &num hours sleep each night . 
^ more importantly , one of the children made a commitment to &name , which was wonderful . 
^ last tuesday evening we all played &name outside in the grounds of the country house we stayed in. &num had to dress up as a &name , and this i did with some relish . 
^ yesterday evening i went to a concert in &name . 
^ the &name &name philharmonic orchestra was playing . 
^ this afternoon i 've been with my family to &name - a nearby country house . 
^ it is very warm today and i like it . 
^ we had quite a good week , weather wise , for the camp . 
^ tomorrow morning i begin my new job for &num weeks . 
^ i will be working from &num o' clock until &num in the lab , and i am quite looking forward to it although i hope it will not be too boring . 
^ i 'm very sorry to hear about your car , although i 'm glad to hear you still patronise &name 's. 
^ &name , now , i wonder if you can help me ? 
^ i am going to buy a &name rewriter , and i would like to be able to put it in my computer . 
^ do you have any advice about which model to go for ? 
^ i hope you are well and making the most of the heat wave currently hitting &name . 
^ all the best , 
^ &name
