^ natural language and information processing group seminar &website / 
^ 12pm , tuesday 5th november , &name 
^ &org , &name &name building , &name &name avenue &website 
^ &name : focusing effects in &name resolution : computational influences and &name &name 
^ speaker : &name &name - &name university 
^ &name : 
^ &name research based on &name &name ( &name , &name , and &name , &num ) has reached the conclusion that an ambiguous pronoun is interpreted immediately as referring to the entity assumed to constitute the local discourse focus , even in the presence of prior semantic information that makes this interpretation implausible . 
^ this contrasts with other experimental research which supports the position that discourse focus exerts a weak influence on pronominal interpretation and is overridden by pragmatic plausibility considerations . 
^ moreover , there is substantial experimental research demonstrating that , even though the processes of resolving a pronoun are initiated as soon as the pronoun is encountered , they are not brought to completion until much later , especially in the case of ambiguous pronouns . 
^ such a result is hardly compatible with the assumption of immediacy of interpretation underlying centering-motivated research . 
^ in this talk i will argue that the discrepancies between centering-based and other psycholinguistic research on focusing and pronominal resolution can be attributed to some extent to the fact that these approaches do not always share the same definition of focus ; that they employ different experimental paradigms ; and that perhaps they probe different aspects of the resolution process . 
^ finally , i will briefly discuss the extent to which a computational model such as &name &name , which is based on distributional observations ( &name , &num ) , can adequately explain psychological processes in general .

^ &name : a lightweight approach to &name retrieval and conversational natural language 
^ speaker : &name &name - &name &name 
^ &name : many approaches to natural language processing require large dictionaries , large grammars or both . 
^ for reasons of development cost , runtime performance and complexity , it can be desirable to avoid this , relying instead on simpler , robust techniques that nevertheless are still fit-for-purpose for many real-world applications . 
^ in this talk , the following software systems will be described and demonstrated : 
^ &name : a real-time text retrieval system that implements a combination of tagged searches , &name keyword searching and statistical approaches . 
^ &name : a conversational natural language processing ( chatterbot ) system that uses &name as a back-end database . 
^ &name : a special purpose programming language with a syntax loosely based upon &name and that is intended for the preprocessing of natural language queries in conversational question answering systems . 
^ &name has been in commercial use for some time by a number of companies within the &name and worldwide . 
^ &name was seen on &name &name 's world in early &num and has been in continuous use within the &name &name " exhibit at the &name point exhibition in &name , &name since its opening . 
^ iscript is currently being used by &name to help develop a number of conversational question answering / multimedia retrieval systems for companies including &name &name group , &name &name , heating direct and others who cannot be mentioned for reasons of confidentiality .
