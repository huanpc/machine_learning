^ hey , by the way , i 've just realised i never actually said . 
^ yes , i would like to go to the conference . 
^ my e-mail does n't seem to have gone round the &name list yet but i bumped into the old &name coordinator and asked her to spread the word and she said she 'd 'stress " &name , the new &name coordinator , also at &name , even though i told her not to ! 
^ &name revision etc. is going well . 
^ see you thursday and happy preparation for the &name . 
^ &name , have you got a copy of the commentary &name recommended . 
^ if not , i got one today , and you 're welcome to borrow it . 
^ i will always do my preparation on sunday evening . 
^ so if you do yours at a different time you can use the same book . 
^ they seem to be in short supply !
