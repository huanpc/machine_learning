^ &name . 
^ &name .

<text_embedded> 

^ &name &name &name ,

^ &name 
</text_embedded>

^ ooooooh .. you sound so veeeeeeeeeeeery faaaaaaaaaaaar 
^ awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay ... waaaaaaaaaaaay .. waaaaaaaaaay ... ( that was the echo , do n't you know . ) 
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ hmmm. .. were you drunk when you wrote this ? 
^ &name . 
^ is that surprising ? 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ i just got the impression that you were drunk when i read the email . 
^ i 'm not sure why now . 
^ i had been drinking myself at the time , although i was n't drunk . 
^ of course , knowing you as i do , i read this as " had een drinking myself at the time , and so i was completely , mind-gezlonckingly drunk " - which explains 
^ * everything * 
<text_embedded> 

^ i 'm ok - quite enjoying work at the &name , even if the randomised &name transform is as good at detecting ellipses as fly splattered on &num windscreen ( special talents of splattered flies withholding ) 
</text_embedded>

^ &name . 
^ it sounds like fun . 
^ so are the splattered flies going to be integrated into your work soon ? 
^ or are they there already , results pending ... ? 
^ exciting . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ unfortunately , the splattered flies will not be integrated into my work since they are proving too hard to peel off the windscreen and the tree-huggers are complaining . 
^ we are using splattered undergrads as a practical and morally acceptable alternative . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ i have a plan . 
^ i may be able to initiate " da plan " tonight - basically want to get next fri evening and sat morning off work so can get to &name . 
</text_embedded>

^ so not this weekend but next ? 
^ i hope that 's what you mean &name me and &name are spending at least a large chunk of this weekend in &name , since he 's spent every other &num in &name . 
^ so , yes , that would be good . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes . 
^ are you drunk ? 
^ ooops , already answered that one ... &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ would 
<text_embedded> 

^ have to party hard though &name i 'd have to be back sat evening ! 
</text_embedded>

^ &name ha . 
^ partying hard ? 
^ well , you 've managed it before , have n't you ... ? 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ true , but i 've got a job ( well , &num ) now and am just sooo grown up and mature now 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name reunion ? 
^ oh dear god help us all ... 
</text_embedded>

^ i did n't mean like any major thing with all the compscis or anything . 
^ i was thinking more the &name boys all being in &name at the same time . 
^ and if i could come to that would be nice &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ and you * didn't * think that was what i was thinking ? 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ how is &name - have n't heard much from him . 
</text_embedded>

^ he 's been a bit sick for the last &num / &num days . 
^ he had to go home from work on monday , but then went straight back again on tuesday , the fool . 
^ but i think he 's more or less completely better now , although it comes and goes , i think . 
^ too much detail ? 
^ sorry &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &char ) you do n't deserve to be earning a zillion pounds per sick day if you do n't take sick days when you can &char ) i 'm not entirely sure what you mean , but , yes , still too much detail 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ but in general he 's fine fine . 
^ enjoying work , liking ( the vast majority of ) the people , visiting &name every weekend , getting paid lots etc. . . 
^ he 'll 
<text_embedded> 

^ have to wait a while longer i 'm afraid . 
^ in the meantime i 'm sure there are many ways you can keep him entertained that , frankly , i do n't even want to think about ! 
</text_embedded>

^ cheeky sod . 
^ well , if you * are * coming not this weekend but next , then he 'll more than likely be in &name anyway . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ ooooh , my head hurts . 
^ take care ... 
^ &name 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>
