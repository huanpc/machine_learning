^ hey &name , 
^ &name the exams are going well ... mine are looming and i still do n't have the foggiest clue about most of the topics . 
^ i dunno , people round here are just too clever , they make me feel small . 
^ on the other hand , i 'm ( slowly ) learning to accept that i 'm not always going to be the best at things like work . 
^ in fact , nowhere near the best most of the time , so that 's got to be a good thing ( me learning to accept it , that is ) ... 
^ serious things aside , your water fight sounded cool ! 
^ the weather here 's been quite cold for the past few days , and very rainy today . 
^ but water fights are to be planned ! 
^ so is punting , although only once it stops raining . 
^ if you email &name , tell him in the strongest terms you feel like using to email me or else . 
^ i have been sending him emails to which he never replies , and i 've even send him an ultimatum threatening dire consequences involving marmite if he does n't, and still i get no response ! ! 
^ honestly ... 
^ &name , &name had her first a-level this morning , general studies . 
^ hopefully , she will be able to confirm my estimate of the number of rows of bricks from the floor to the ceiling of the sports hall ... 
^ what else can i tell you that will be interesting ? 
^ um , i do n't think there 's anything else really , as nothing much is going on round here . 
^ i really hope your exams go well and that you achieve the best you can . 
^ does term end as soon as your exams end ? 
^ if so , wow . 
^ you will be lazing around and eating ice-cream while i do my exams , and gloating about it too , no doubt . 
^ well , that 's what i 'd do , anyhow ! ! 
^ lots of love and bye for now ,

^ hey people ! 
^ guess what happened this morning . 
^ fire alarm ! ! ! ! 
^ fun , fun fun ! ! ! ! 
^ some idiot was burning toast at &num : &num . 
^ you would think that people who were smart enough to get to &name would be able to cook toast . 
^ you would also think that they would n't be cooking it at that time in the morning . 
^ well , it did get me up i suppose . 
^ revision is going much better this morning . 
^ i should do ok in tomorrow 's fun exam . 
^ it is just a bit more detailed than what we did at a-level , &name . 
^ we had so much fun last night , just as i was going to go to bed . 
^ lets just say it involved copious amounts of water , friends and &name and &name 's room . 
^ it was quite funny , as they thought i was going to soak them for some reason , so they had set up a water trap on top of the door . 
^ &name , i am too cunning , and ( cunningly ) realised what they were up to ( and also i was n't planning to soak them either ) so did n't get wet . 
^ anyway , someone had to , so we tried to get &name wet , by shoving him into the water trap . 
^ eventually he was slightly dampend , and things went on from there . 
^ water was being flung around in bowls ! 
^ i think the best bit was when someone was triing to get me wet , so i pulled &name on top of me and he got more wet , ( remember that &name ! ! ! ! 
^ - &name ! ) then &name was also slightly wetted as well . 
^ i then commented that i was quite dry , and got a bowl of water thrown in my face ! 
^ &name , how fun ! ! ! 
^ anyway , back to revision , 
^ take care , 
^ &name
