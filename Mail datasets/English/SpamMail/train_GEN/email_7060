^ dear all , 
^ i need &num stewards for the cums &num concert next wednesday 12th march from 
^ &num 15pm in &name road . 
^ it 's a lovely programme ( &name , &name & &name ) and you will get a free seat in return for your services . 
^ i also need &num to &num stewards for the wind orchestra concert for schools in the &name hall on friday 14th march ( red nose day ! ) from 1pm - 3pm . 
^ it would be good to have people prepared to look slightly wacky to celebrate the day , and who also feel comfortable around that many children ! 
^ ( &num already booked ) 
^ please let me know if you can help at either of these concerts asap . 
^ thanks a lot , &name
