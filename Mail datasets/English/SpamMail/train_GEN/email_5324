^ there was another bug i fixed for one of the students this &website . 
^ can you copy it over from my home directory please ? 
^ i think to be fair everyone should know about it . 
^ the bug was that after using &name : : close ( ) , the next time you called &name : : open ( ) , it would fail to parse the &name header . 
^ the open ( )/close ( ) pairs now work as intended . 
^ eh
