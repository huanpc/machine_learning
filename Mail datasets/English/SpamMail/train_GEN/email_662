^ &name , about your text messages ; if you do n't want me to come and see you , i wo n't, seeing as i have a " great capacity for irritating ( you ) " ; it certainly does n't sound like you want to see me . 
^ what can i say ? 
^ you hated it when i wrote you something this rude , and now you 're doing it to me . 
^ i am tired and incredibly worried about my work . 
^ i am sorry that i forgot to come and see you , but i really do n't think it merits this kind of behaviour , and i really ca n't take it at the moment . 
^ it just seems really petulant , as does your comment replying to &name 's email about the festival dinner . 
^ what happened to forgive and forget ? 
^ you make me feel really bad ; as if i 'm not feeling rubbish enough already . 
^ i do n't really know what else to write . 
^ &name .
