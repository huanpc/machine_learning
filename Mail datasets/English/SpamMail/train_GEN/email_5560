^ &name : focusing effects in &name resolution : computational influences and &name &name 
^ speaker : &name &name - &name university 
^ &name : 
^ &name research based on &name &name ( &name , &name , and &name , &num ) has reached the conclusion that an ambiguous pronoun is interpreted immediately as referring to the entity assumed to constitute the local discourse focus , even in the presence of prior semantic information that makes this interpretation implausible . 
^ this contrasts with other experimental research which supports the position that discourse focus exerts a weak influence on pronominal interpretation and is overridden by pragmatic plausibility considerations . 
^ moreover , there is substantial experimental research demonstrating that , even though the processes of resolving a pronoun are initiated as soon as the pronoun is encountered , they are not brought to completion until much later , especially in the case of ambiguous pronouns . 
^ such a result is hardly compatible with the assumption of immediacy of interpretation underlying centering-motivated research . 
^ in this talk i will argue that the discrepancies between centering-based and other psycholinguistic research on focusing and pronominal resolution can be attributed to some extent to the fact that these approaches do not always share the same definition of focus ; that they employ different experimental paradigms ; and that perhaps they probe different aspects of the resolution process . 
^ finally , i will briefly discuss the extent to which a computational model such as &name &name , which is based on distributional observations ( &name , &num ) , can adequately explain psychological processes in general .
