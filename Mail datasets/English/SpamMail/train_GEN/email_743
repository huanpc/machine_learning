^ &name , 
^ ok , here 's the deal . 
^ &name &name signal processing , meaning that you can add effects like reverb and chorus to the sounds ( pianos , guitars , etc. .. ) 
^ &name musical instrument &name &name ( or something like that ! ) . 
^ this means that you can link an instrument with &name to other instruments or devices such as the computer . 
^ this is how i do my computer based recording using the keyboard . 
^ i would suggest that for future use , &name is probably vital . 
^ i am surprised that the &name keyboard does not have &name , but i suppose that is why it is so cheap , as otherwise it sounds superior to the casio . 
^ any further questions let me know ! 
^ &name
