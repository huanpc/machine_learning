^ " little truffler " ? ? ? 
^ " was just about to speak to you when you disappeared . " 
^ - oh , you were too slow . 
^ sorry . 
^ 'some random guy emailed me and said that he had just moved here and wanted to meet people and he " noticed i went to school here " , how would he get this info ? 
^ and is he a creep ? 
^ and do i have a cyberstalker ? " 
^ - i would say he definitely must be a creep . 
^ all the evidence points to that . 
^ seriously , though , perhaps someone is playing a practical joke on you . 
^ if not , then it is quite probable that he ( or she ) could find out such details about you . 
^ i do n't know how , but it is possible . 
^ as to having a cyberstalker again , an exciting possibility . 
^ are you happy ? 
^ what film did you go and see ? 
^ bye ,
