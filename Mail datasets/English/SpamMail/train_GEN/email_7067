^ hi &name 
^ that is indeed an old e-mail , but you received it by design not fault . 
^ if you would like to be a rep that would be great , all it involves is mc-ing the coffee trolley after the &num : &num service , once in a while . 
^ i hope the concert is all set and preparations are going well , have i asked you if you are coming on the houseparty ? 
^ &name bless 
^ &name 
^ sorting though a load of old e-mails & found this one from the start of term . 
^ i disgarded it then because i did n't know about the letter , so assumed that i had been &name 'd in by mistake . 
^ i assume i was right to do so ? 
^ i 'll get back to you about the website soon , once i 've had some time to analyse the site properly , so i do n't make any generalisations that are n't true . 
^ &name 
^ on wednesday &num &name &num &num : &num , you wrote :

^ hey &name 
^ i pray that lectures and supervisions are going well and you are enjoying cycling in the rain as much as i am . 
^ not . 
^ anyway &name and &name wrote to you all last year , asking if you wished to help out at &name and be student reps , if you would that is great , just reply to this e-mail and i will put you down to help out . 
^ the job of rep is very easy , and a great blessing to the church and us ( &name &name , &name and myself . ) there are &num basic elements , first being your usual wonderful selves in church and student lunch . 
^ second , helping out on the student coffee trolley rota ( which reduces over crowding at the coffee bar at the back of the church . ) thirdly represent &name &name in your college and the university as a whole , and bring people along especially lost looking freshers if you see any to church , student lunch and risky living etc. &name you are all well and hopefully see you at risky living tomorrow or at &name . 
^ any problems please do be in touch . 
^ &name bless
