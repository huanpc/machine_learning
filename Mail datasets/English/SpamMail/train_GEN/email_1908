( ! ) i agree that your dad 's joke [ [ you are ] looking for a first class male ] is original . ^ " has your mum been keeping the house to its usual standards ? ^ my mum does not keep this house to my standards i do . ^ however , i have been helping her to wallpaper last week very boring ! ^ i am glad you are enjoying / being challenged by " too busy not to pray . ^ i hope all your family is well and that you have a lovely christmas . ^ see you , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
