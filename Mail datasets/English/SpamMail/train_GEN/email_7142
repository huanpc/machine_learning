^ &name - what happened ? 
^ of course , we would be more than happy if you do anything , you have do so much already ... 
^ &name &name &name , inc. 
^ conexware contact information support : &email sales : &email 
^ i 've been doing a lot of thinking over recent days . 
^ as you will be aware , my circumstances have changed somewhat over the last year , and there are further changes to come in my private life . 
^ i 'm going to get more busy , not less . 
^ you will be equally aware that &name &name development has all but come to a standstill , with predominant work being on the &name stubs , but even that has been slow . 
^ as i 've looked ahead and given it all some thought , i 've had to make some difficult decisions . 
^ they 're probably things i should have decided on earlier , before i 'd made commitments . 
^ &name &name development in itself , i think , is going to have to cease . 
^ i _may_ yet release a bug-fix release ( &num perhaps ) , but that 'll be the last version , if even that materialises . 
^ i ca n't really provide the support it needs , let alone find proper time to design , code & test it further . 
^ &name 
^ contrarily is going from strength to strength . 
^ i therefore propose that all of the features in &name &name are rolled into &name . 
^ this process has already started , but some of the more obscure features could perhaps be made available in an " expert " mode . 
^ i will ensure that you have spanning of a sort . 
^ i 'll also help you to integrate these features into &name . 
^ this however leaves &num areas of development ( which you are connected to ) , the &name stubs and the resource editing code , used for the custom icon support . 
^ the latter is less of a problem , since i have licensed it for use with the innosetup project and released source code therein and therefore should any problems arise with the code , i should be able to glean patches from that project as well as a small level of maintenance myself . 
^ that therefore poses the smaller problem . 
^ the bigger problem lies with the &name stubs . 
^ whilst i can do a small amount of coding on them now , i ca n't guarantee that going on into the future . 
^ i therefore feel that implementing large new features ( other than those already virtually completed ) at this stage would be unwise , since even if i had the time and energy to complete them , i may well not be able to test and fix bugs in them properly . 
^ this could compromise the whole &name stub . 
^ for the time being i shall continue to fix bugs and make very 
^ minor changes to the &name stubs . 
^ i shall also provide you with the almost-implemented new features of a custom icon , ability to digitally sign &name , multiple commands can be run after extraction and support for creating a link on the desktop . 
^ after that however , it shall just be tidying up the code and fixing bugs . 
^ ultimately i shall probably have to pack in development of the &name stubs too . 
^ prior to that i shall sort out the code & make it in a reasonable state to release . 
^ i shall then be able to let you ( and anybody else who wants it ) have the source code ( in &char rather than &name i 'm afraid ) to continue development . 
^ perhaps i 'll release it under &name on my website . 
^ unfortunately &num cannot really put a timescale on this to help you plan ahead , though i fear it could be sooner rather than later . 
^ i 'm sorry to throw all this upon you so suddenly and to be doing this to you . 
^ it 's been great to be able to contribute to &name by providing &name &name and the &name stubs and amazing to see &name 's growth from when i first 
^ started in the days of &name &name when it could just about do &name files . 
^ it 's come a long way and does you both credit . 
^ i 'd be interested to hear your thoughts and any ideas for taking things forward . 
^ regards , 
^ &name
