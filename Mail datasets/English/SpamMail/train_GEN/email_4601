^ i think you 'd be better off not anonymising , actually , or not telling potential email donors thta you 're anonymising , because you wo n't be doing it with high enough recall to remove embarrassment . 
^ and if you tell people you 're anonymising , and whatever you do misses a name , then they might feel upset . 
^ anyway , i think i can get you some data where the senders would n't object , but i 'll have to check it first , so this wo n't be for a few days .
