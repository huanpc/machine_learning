^ hi &name ! 
^ okay ... 
^ go to " tools " , " internet options " and then delete your temporary internet files and clear your history . 
^ then you 'll need to go to 'my computer " , " &char " , " windows " , " temporary internet files " and delete all the cookies there ( i.e. all the files ) . 
^ if you have any difficulty please email me . 
^ i think my directions are correct , but they might not be . 
^ glad you had a good weekend with &name . 
^ please note that talking is n't an exclusively girly thing . 
^ i have only &num more days of work left ! 
^ &name
