^ ok , here 's my suggestions : 
^ there are these really nice little microwave pizzas at &name ( &name ) . 
^ we could pick up some of them and cook them round at my house or college , or even &name 's. 
^ ( this would save money but perhaps a little lacking in venecian atmosphere ) 
^ we could actually go out for pizza , which would clearly be more expensive , but then again its only money . 
^ rsvp ,
