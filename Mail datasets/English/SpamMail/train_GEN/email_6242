^ dear all , 
^ &name 's &name is ever closing in on us with only a week and a half to go ! 
^ we would deeply value your prayers for this event . 
^ there will be opportunity to corporately pray in our last prayer meeting before the day , which is next tuesday , 5th feb. it is at 7.30pm until &num ( ish ) and will consist of &num / &num hour of catching up with the latest news , reviewing the final draft of the programme , discussing the weather etc. and then we 'll pray from &num . 
^ it 'll be in &name 's room , which is &name ( &name &name ) &name college - if you do n't know where that is either e-mail me for directions or ask someone who does . 
^ as this is the last prayer meeting before the 11th , we would really value your presence at this meeting if you are able to attend . 
^ if you can come then that 's great . 
^ could you please e-mail us so that we know rough numbers ? 
^ if tuesday night is your essential &name honey appreciation meeting that you have been waiting to go to for months and just ca n't miss it because you 'll never get another chance to sample &num different types of honey , then we 'll quite happily send you a list of prayer points by e-mail if you let us know . 
^ if you just do n't know if you can make it because your auntie &name has said that she might come up on tuesday and wants to go out for a meal , but then again , she might come up on wednesday ... then by all means e-mail me for a list of prayer points in case you ca n't come and leave it open as to whether or not you are coming . 
^ many thanks ,
