^ you missed some features 
^ - the left and right as rest to resizing policy 'minimum " so the center takes all available space 
</text_embedded>

^ i do n't want the center to take all available space . 
^ in fact , if anything , the third panel should take up more space so as to provide room for content . 
^ there is nothing special about the centre column. . 
</text_embedded>

^ i disagree ; the amount of different templates per " category " can grow quite easily . 
^ you do n't want it growing vertically when it can grow horizontally . 
^ remember that a company can easily create &num templates for their styles which have to be viewed correctly . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ then we make the icons smaller .. no big deal . ...

^ 
^ - the open button should be right aligned ( its a bit too big now ) 
</text_embedded>

^ that 's sort of the point . 
^ it 's in an out-of-the way place , so &char wanted to make sure it is noticeable . 
</text_embedded>

^ this just makes me think its positioned wrong ; you are prepared to break standard &name rules to make it look different since ( as you allready found ) it is out of place ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ what ? 
^ the button is contextually related to the third panel and avoids confusion by keeping it near the locus of attention and away from the other buttons . 
^ this has nothing to do with breaking 'standard &name rules " . 
</text_normal>

<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - you miss the location label ( for recent files ) 
</text_embedded>

^ that would appear in the third pane in the description area . 
</text_embedded>

^ &char &name tends to get quite long , and spanning it over &num lines surely does not increas readablility . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ and have a label that is empty &num of the time taking up space in a special place of the dialog is not an option . 
^ all the detailed information should be in the final pane , assuming we even need to show the entire &name . 
^ it could just as well be shown like : 
^ host : ( hostname ) protocol : ( protocol ) path : ( path ) 
^ with the filename right below the icon ( where the &name is in the mockup ) . 
^ if the file is a local file , the host and protocol lines can be skipped . 
</text_normal>

^ 
^ - you miss the intro text 
</text_embedded>

^ third pane . 
</text_embedded>

^ surely not ; the intro is about the whole dialog . 
^ its an intro on what you are doing in this dialog and should be a &num liner that does not go away ; that has no place in a context sensitive panel ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ if this dialog requires a permenant intro text we 're doing something horribly wrong . 
^ we should minimize the amount of noise in this dialog and a label across the top that will get read once at best and should never need to be read in the first place is rediculous . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &char want them beside the words ... this keep the relationship between icon and text completely unambiguous , 
</text_embedded>

^ since we have different background colors per row this is not any better above my proposal . 
^ plus that the concept of icon above text is pretty omnipresent in every &name . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ every &name ? 
^ you mean like the listview in konquror ? 
^ or the sidebar in konqueror ? 
^ or the folder list in kmail ? 
^ or in &name &char ? 
^ or in &name &name ? 
^ or ... shall i go on ? 
^ this is n't a konqueror &num icon view , this is a vertical listing ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ saves vertical space ( allowing larger icons &char / out a vertical scroll bar ) and preserves the left-to-right nature of this dialog . 
^ see the macos &char finder for examples of this ... 
</text_embedded>

^ but the horizontal space is always more expensive then the vertical space of a computer screen . 
^ so this does not make any sense . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ last time &char checked virtually every single monitor in the world is wider than it is tall . 
^ when you include the default position of the &name panel , vertical space is indeed at a premium and horizontal space is much greater . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ amazingly enough ; whenever you see a screenshot of konqueror you see the icons view . 
^ the icons there are above the text . 
^ as people only make screenshots of things they think are beutiful ( for the purpose of demo-ing anyway &smiley i think you are wrong in your assumptions . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ screenshots of konqueror in its default configuration are irrelevant to topic at hand . 
^ the use cases are different , the default config different , etc , etc , etc. . . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ it is about what the button is for relative to the placement of the button . 
^ if i make an outline of the dialog ( only the panel outlines and lines plus the buttons , and absolutely no text ) people will not expect the usage you want this button to have . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ really ? 
^ you mean that people going left - ) right and ending up in the third panel where it describes the document choice they 've selected with a great big 'start with this " button wo n't figure it out ? 
^ the button is closest to the locus of attention when evaluating the selection . 
^ the buttons on the bottom of the dialog are clearly different actions . 
^ it 's ok , i 'll do some user testing this week ... then we wo n't need to banter back and forth about it ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ any texts , colors or other goodies are no substitute for correct placement of buttons . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i did n't say anything about colors or goodies , and i think this is a valid placement of that button . 
^ erg ... anyone besides &name care to comment ?
