" . ^ i was in  ame all of this week . ^ i went on monday and stayed with  ame and  ame until yesterday afternoon . ^ i had a really great week , most of it spent with  ame as  ame was in hospital recieving treatment from monday to thursday , but we went and visited him every day . ^ he was really cheerful and we 've had some exciting news too . ... a scan he had last week has revealed that the tumour has seriously decreased in size . ^ he is going to have a more detailed scan in a week or so to identify how much is left , but the doctor he spoke to has said that the treatment he will need to recieve is likely to be drastically reduced . ^ he will need a few more chemo sessions and then  um weeks or so of radiotherapy and then he may be in the clear ! ! ^ how cool is that ? ? ? ^  ame really does answer prayer ! ^ so , as well as that excitment i did lots of fun things with  ame and had a very lovely time . ^ it rained most days ( for a few minutes or for hours at a time . ... it is  ame after all ! ! ) . ^ i started doing some economics reading last week too . ^ did n't get very far , but it 's a start . ^ i intend to do lots this week . . ... ^ so , back to the " would you like to meet up ? " thing ... i was reading the  ame thingy that  ame put in their trains to try and relieve the boredom of their journey and i noticed in the " what 's on in  ame " section an advert for an exibition at the  ame museum in town . ^ it is a  ame  ame exhibition and looks kind of  ame . ^ it apparantly has lots of cool trekkie stuff ( costumes , sets , gadgets , " turn yourself into a klingon " ( or something like that ) ... etc. so , i wondered if sometime ( when you are free - possibly  um saturday ) you would fancy coming down to  ame and we could go and see it and have lunch in town / picnic in the park and maybe go back to my house for tea . ^ the exhibition costs  ound;  um , but there may be student discount and it runs until the beginning of sept sometime ( i 'll have to check exactly when ) . ^ what do you think ? ^ well , i am feeling exceptionally sleepy after a long day . ^ our church went up to  ame today ( do you know where that is ? ^ - near  ame ) as we have the use of a house there for the next  um weeks . ^ i may be going and staying up there next week . ^ well , i hope you had a nice day in  ame ( - what were you doing there ? ) and you have a good week at work . ^ glad the job is ok . ^ i 'm off to bed . ^ bye for now ,  ame ^ get your free download of  ame explorer at  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
