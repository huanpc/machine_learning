^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for the note of support . 
^ it 's been very heartening to find that most all people , and nations , have expressed their sympathy , and support in finding the guilty parties . 
^ but this is just the very earliest stage of what most agree will be a very long conflict . 
^ i 'm sure you 're getting as much detail as to what preparations and alliances are forming so i wo n't go into that . 
^ we 'll see what falls out soon enough . 
^ certainly , in my opinion , the most difficult struggle will take place in the 'moslem &name " itself , the leaders and peoples of these nations must each decide what islam is really about , whether 'submission to &name " ( i read somewhere that that was the definition of the very word islam ) means sticking up for one 's own no matter what horrible acts they commit in the name of their beliefs , or something greater . 
^ it is my inclination that most will choose the " greater " . 
^ however , i do n't kid myself about it being easy . 
^ at the end of this we may see more moslem on moslem violence than voilence from without . 
^ from any scenario it 's a grim picture . 
^ we must pray for them too ! 
^ we 've had a few isolated reports of a few individuals attacking or harassing people who look like they might be of middle eastern heritage , or mosques , but they seemed to have ceased after the first few days . 
^ there is a mosque not far from my home here where someone went to pour gasoline , but the cops arrested him . 
^ the next day dozens of neighborhood people joined hands with the american muslims who worship there and folks honked their support from their cars as they drove by ! 
^ there have been many such reports of americans of all races , religions , previous nationalites getting together like this all over the country . 
^ it 's really great . 
^ this is the &name i 've always wanted to live in , so , gosh , for the first time i can say , " i 'm proud to be an american ! " so , yes , for now it seems , things are under control . 
^ i understand your countrymen 's concern about the " blank check " notion . 
^ on the other hand , this really is an enemy not just of &num country , but the " world as it is " . 
^ so , it 's very heartening to hear &name , and &name for that matter , promise " all for &num and one for all " . 
^ the fact that even &name , &name , and now even &name ( ! ) are throwing in is incredible ! 
^ but , as i said , we' 'll see what falls out . 
^ president &name said " adversity introduces us to ourselves . " soon , we will see the true colors of a lot of nations through this . 
^ as far as my friend &name goes , recently she has expressed that she is having some difficulty knowing what her true feelings are about me , and about being in a significant relationship , but also asked to continue despite her confusion . 
^ that 's pretty much to be expected along the way , but in the meantime , let 's not get too ahead of things . 
^ as you said , if it 's meant to be , it will come about . 
^ well , " old one " better go here . 
^ keep us in your prayers . 
^ hi to your folks , too &smiley
