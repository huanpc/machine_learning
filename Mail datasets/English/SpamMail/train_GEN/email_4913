^ hi professor &name , 
^ i have a question about the extra hours that i have been working recently . 
^ i am sure that you are aware that i worked more than &num hours last week ( about &num hours ) and i think that from time to time it might be necessary for me to work more than &num hours again . 
^ at the beginning of the summer , you said that i was being hired for &num weeks , &num hours a week for $ &num . 
^ but because of sigmod , my first day of work was n't until june 7th . 
^ so , &num weeks from june 7th would have brought me to september 5th for my final day of work . 
^ but i took a week off to go to &name in june so that means the &num weeks would take me to september 12th . 
^ so i was wondering if i could combine the extra &num hours that i worked this past week with the extra &num hours that i will no doubt work before the final demo to make &num extra hours ( or &num week ) so that i could stop work on september 5th . 
^ that would really help me out because that would give me some time off before i leave for &name to buy everything i need and to pack etc. if this is not ok , then i understand - i would have worked the extra hours regardless of compensation . 
^ &name
