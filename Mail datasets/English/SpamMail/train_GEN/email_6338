^ &name ! 
^ you , unlike me , are an expert at writing emails ... 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ but a very slow replier &smiley i 'm not very good with communication in the vacs because the only internet connection is on my dad 's computer ( &name ) . 
^ however , i like to keep copies of e-mails i send and receive ( useful when i need to back-reference something ) and so i insist on doing e-mails via my computer . 
^ therefore i have to download them on my dad 's computer , then transfer them to mine ( &name ) and import them into &name . 
^ i then sort through them , reply to appropriate &num and then run the outbox through a script to convert it to e-mails for &name mail ( &name ) to send . 
^ i then copy that to my dad 's computer . 
^ because it 's a bit of a hassle , i tend to only do it periodically . 
^ however , my dad has promised to put a phone connection in my room for christmas which will be very cool ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i am impressed , both by the length , information content and scope of your email ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ well , i have &num styles of e-mail , letter and memo . 
^ i 'd normally do the letter style as a snail-mail letter , but it 's cheaper to e-mail it &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i really wanted the first term lectures to be in &name as well .. sigh ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ we 've got practicals there though . 
^ and after that we 're in &name . 
^ it does mean less travelling too and we still do n't have any &num o' clocks . 
^ and we have n't been in the &name yet ( i do n't think , anyway ) , so it 'll be a new lecture theatre for us . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i am sure , that i shall be struggling next year ... as the work will be more comsci-ish than ever .. darn ! 
^ anyway . , , , , you 've gtta help me out ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ it 's teamwork , &name . 
^ you help me , i help you - i help you , you help me . 
^ hopefully that way we can focus on our strengths and help each other in our weaknesses . 
^ so that means you do all the work whilst i copy you &smiley 
^ and there 's no geology to distract you this time ! 
^ i will miss it tho " . 
^ i actually quite liked the geology and though i was n't any good at it , i did enjoy it and find it really interesting . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ and did you know .. i am doing a full-time german course as well ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name ? 
^ dann wir k' nnen unsere &name zusammen verbessen . 
^ ... and when you 've learnt german , you can work out what that means ! 
^ i did german a-level . 
^ i must however get back into it , because i 'm losing it . 
^ i keep saying i 'll install my &name box in german , but i never have the courage to do it . 
^ was w' rde passieren , wenn ich einen &name mache ? 
^ dann w' rde ich vielleicht die &name nicht verstanden ! 
^ ( what would happen if i made a mistake ? 
^ then i might not understand the help system ) . 
^ yes , i really must practise my german ! ! ! ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ things are gonna be really hard ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i 'm sure you 'll just cope fine &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ wish me luck mate. . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ good luck ... 
^ as for me : 
^ this term i have part &name &name science i 'm jointly organising another &name concert for the &name term i 'm international rep for the &name group in &name i 'm singing in cums and in the &name singers i 've become webmaster for the german society ( once i 've redone their site , pref . 
^ by end of october ) i 've become webmaster ( again , another site to put together , this time by christmas ) for the &name &name 's &name ( &name ) charity to be launched in the new year . 
^ obviously i 'm also in the rambler 's society and have the &name meetings and church . 
^ so i think i might be busy myself ! 
^ when are you in &name &name ? 
^ i 've got a small ( ish ) request for you when you do go up . 
^ by the end of september , &name are suppose to have released version &num of their &name . 
^ i 've currently got version &num , but with lots of updated progs and packages , and i 've updated things so much that i 've made a mess of my system and have various conflicts . 
^ therefore i badly need the updated system ! 
^ so i was wondering if you could download it for me & burn it to cd-r ? 
^ obviously i 'll pay you for the &name . 
^ i 'm up from the evening of the 4th , so it 'd be good to meet up soon after that . 
^ best regards and take care , 
^ &name

^ my mum 's yelling at me to get to the dining table for lunch catch ye &num &name 
^ hi &name ! 
^ hows ya ? 
^ it 's been ages since i last heard & i 've been meaning to write for a while . 
^ glad you got my postcard - i 'm surprised they forwarded it to &name , &name i only paid postage enough for &name , so i thought you 'd get it at college . 
^ anyways , it 's got to you . 
^ you been up to much over the vac ? 
^ other than &name i also had a week in &name with my family , staying with relatives and friends . 
^ then spent time relaxing , doing volunteer work , &name ( non comp-sci stuff &smiley ) , bit of programming ( that code i did for innosetup , the author is looking at adopting for the main project which is cool ) etc. went to one of the &name &name earlier in august with some girls from &name which was cool . 
^ i am however like you really looking forward to next year . 
^ it 'll be good to be back in &name and in the midst of it all ! 
^ &name for pointing out that the lecture list is out - it makes an interesting read ( and it 's impressive to show relatives &name &name 's concise lecture list and demonstrate that i actually understand it ! ) . 
^ not much in the &name &name in &name ( except practicals ) & no saturday lectures in &name . 
^ but &name &name every saturday in &name is a bit much ! 
^ &name . 
^ law & economics seems to be a new course - i ca n't find reference to it in previous years material . 
^ could be interesting , especially with &name &name ( who you 'll probably have heard of , especially if you are a slashdot person ) . 
^ the artificial intelligence course i 've been told by a comp . 
^ sci . 
^ lecturer at a college near me ( a family friend ) will be quite hard , so it 's worth doing the extra reading . 
^ and do n't miss my &name 's lectures on graphics &smiley the group project should be cool , i 'm quite looking forward to that , and also &name theory & complexity . 
^ security could be really interesting or really dull - i guess only time will tell ! 
^ still , for someone who got a 1st , i 'm sure you 'll fly through the year with a breeze ;- ) . 
^ only jokin " - i know you worked hard for it . 
^ did i tell you that when i got the breakdown of my marks , my &name noted that it was the &name maths that really brought me down & i should be fine for a &num : &num next year ? 
^ and have you had a chance to read your bible or talk to &name over the summer ? 
^ i was reading a great passage yesterday - " praise be to the &name and father of our &name &name &name ! 
^ in his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of &name &name from the dead , and into an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade - kept in heaven or you , who through faith are shielded by &name 's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time . " . 
^ because although we do n't deserve anything , &name sent ( " in his great mercy " ) his &name &name to die on the cross and then rise from the dead , so we can be forgiven ( " a new birth " ) and receive eternal life in heaven ( " an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade " ) . 
^ that 's pretty amazing &name ! 
^ how are things in your part of the world ? 
^ schools start again this week here , so things are getting back into order after the summer and things running as usual . 
^ weather 's good , but we 're told is to deteriorate . 
^ and the politicians are bickering as per usual . 
^ somethings just do n't change ! 
^ anyway , gotta go - cya soon , 
^ &name
