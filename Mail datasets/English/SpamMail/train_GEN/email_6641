^ if this is not the case , please let me know . 
^ anyone else who was thinking of coming tell me very soon , as we are already looking pretty packed . 
^ ( &num ) &name &name &name 
^ each year , through the &name &name memorial trust , the british mountaineering club runs &num &num day winter mountain skills workshops in the lake district . 
^ the courses this year are on the 8th and 9th of &name . 
^ cost is &pound; &num + accommodation . 
^ full details can be found on the &name website at the following link : &website application forms can be printed from : &website please note that application forms should be received by the &name by 10th jan. the weekend is likely to clash with a club trip , but is very useful nevertheless . 
^ you may be able to join with other club members in arranging transport . 
^ it would be useful if you could let me know if you are applying . 
^ &name meets secretary , &name &name went last year , and writes : 
^ " while it only spans &num day of practical teaching in the hills the &name &name is very useful as a first taster of winter hill walking . 
^ the instructors will try to tailor the instruction to your particular needs , depending on what you tell them you want from it . 
^ when i did it last year we covered walking with crampons , use of the ice axe , rope work and self arrests . 
^ in the &num day we spent about half an hour on steep grass learning how to move up down and across slopes in crampons ; we did what in summer would have been an easy scramble , roped together and learning to &name and use natural rock features to protect ourselves in case of a fall ; at the top of the hill we had just climbed we then threw ourselves down a snow slope for about an hour tobogganing on our backsides and learning to stop ourselves . 
^ any time that was n't spent doing this was navigation practice . 
^ it made a real difference having someone actually show you how to navigate between small features on the ground in mist . 
^ we covered pacing , timing , spotting features , walking on bearings 
^ " basically if you are experienced and confident at walking in the winter hills then this is n't for you . 
^ if you are interested in learning some very useful skills to help you to walk in such conditions in relative safety or just to get a taster of what winter walking involves then this course is very good and very , very cheap . 
^ ( &num ) &num &name mountain rescue &name calendars 
^ please contact &name &name ( mailto : &email ) if you are interested in purchasing a calendar . 
^ here 's a bit info from him : 
^ " as you probably know , the &name operates ( as do all others ) on an entirely voluntary basis , with most members holding down a full time job ( my brother-in-law is a teacher , another friend is a solicitor etc. ) and with annual costs of around &pound; &num , &num . 
^ this does n't sound much , but without substantial benefactors , all the money has to be charitably raised . 
^ the &name is available &num hours a day , &num days a year , and volunteers spend &num hours per year on rescues . 
^ the &name is responsible for rescuing people from the &name , &name , &name and &name valley areas ( highest fell in the area &name ) . 
^ 'so , violins away , i wondered would any members be interested in buying &num calendars . 
^ they cost a mere &pound; &num and feature pictures of &name scenery and the &name in action . 
^ i can bring them back down with me in january when i return from home , and maybe monies could be exchanged then . " 
^ it 's been a great term for c.u.h.w.c. with lots of new members , some very enjoyable ( and popular trips ) and great socials . 
^ next term promises to be just as good ( if not better ) ! 
^ it really just remains for me to wish everyone a fantastic festive season and i look forward to seeing lots of you next term ! 
^ best wishes ,
