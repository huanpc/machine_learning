^ hi guys , i have just been told by the pres . 
^ himself that tea and coffee is going to be served after the evening talks which will clearly require clearing up so , this is a plea to those of you who have very kindly offered to help at the evening talks on friday , saturday and sunday . 
^ i wonder if you would be able &char saty around for a bit after the talks in order to help clear up . 
^ i know this may be difficult for some people who have other commitments afterwards but &name and &char really would appreciate this . 
^ so , if you are down to help at one of these talks and are unable to saty on for about &num / &num hr afterwards then could you let me know . 
^ alos &num people have very kindly volunteered to be at stag on the friday and saturday to meet the &name &name but we still need someone to be there on the sunday between &num and &num . 
^ thank you so much for all your help and because of it i have no doubt that everything will run smoothly ! 
^ love &name &smiley
