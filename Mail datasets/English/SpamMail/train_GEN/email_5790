^ &name : 
^ sunday afternoon will be fine for me . 
^ i 'm at &num &name road : &website &website jf you can catch a bus to &name , &name &name ( opposite &name &name ) is the name of the stop , which is , unsurprisingly , right next to &name &name , which is handy because you need to turn into &name &name and walk up to the t-junction ( maybe 100yards ? ) then turn left into &name road . 
^ along about &num yards on your left is no. &num - a mostly pale blue house with a green door . 
^ my phone number is : &num . 
^ any time afternoon would be fine for me - how 's &name or thereabouts ? 
^ i 'll be in all afternoon , so a bit of slippage &num way or the other is no problem . 
^ i 'll be happy to drive you back to &name with the monitor ( assuming you want it ) but parking around there is difficult , otherwise i 'd bring it to you . 
^ if you know of / can arrange parking in / near to the college on sunday afternoon , i 'll bring it over anyway - it 's not really the kind of item you would want to carry very far ! 
^ let me know if this is ok with you .

^ thank you for your reply . 
^ i can get to &name to look at it , though i cannot easily transport a monitor from there , unless there happens to be a bus-stop right by your house ( since i am at &name , so the bus station is right by college ) . 
^ as for times , saturday or sunday afternoon would be ideal for me , but i could manage friday evening if that would be better for you . 
^ many thanks , 
^ &name 
^ on wednesday &num &name &num &num : &num , you wrote :

^ &name : 
^ i 'm pretty sure it will do 1024x768 @ 75hz and better ; i 'll check its specs and get back to you . 
^ i am at the &name but the monitor is at home in &name and i 'd rather not drag it into work . 
^ is it possible for you to get over to &name at an evening / weekend ? 
^ alternatively , i could bring it to you , as i have transport . 
^ let me know what suits you . 
^ &name
