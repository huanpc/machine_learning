^ &name , this debate sounds like a blast . 
^ did you go ? 
^ i 'm sure the professor of &name would 've been mighty interesting , even if he does come from the bestest uni around . 
^ and guess what . 
^ i 'm not pinboning ! ! ! 
^ ok , i 've been trimming and packing non-stop for the last &num days and it 's boring as hell but it 's not pinboning ! 
^ and i 've caused an upset already . 
^ apparently in my interview i was supposed to mention the fact that i need time off for &char in the park and my holiday but i did n't know this . 
^ i have to go and speak to personnel but my chargehand thinks they 'll say no cuz i 'm there for so little time as it is and there 's no point in my being there if i 'm off too much . 
^ but if they think i 'm missing either then they can think again . 
^ &name . 
^ ok , i 'm finished my rant . 
^ &name
