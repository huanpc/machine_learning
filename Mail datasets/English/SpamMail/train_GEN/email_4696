^ &char slight issue arises due to the use of re and fwd in emails . 
^ for example , subject headings are often something like : 
^ " fwd : how tall is an elephant ? " 
^ if i tag fwd as a verb , might that throw off the tag transitions for the rest of the sentence ? 
^ it seems that perhaps it is distributionally more similar to an interjection , or some sentence-level modifier . 
^ could you also argue that it is short-hand for something like : 
^ " this is a forward : how tall is an elephant ? " 
^ in which case perhaps it should be tagged as a noun . 
^ similar issues apply to re - ( re : how tall is an elephant ? ) 
^ sorry if this is all a bit pedantic .
