^ module testing should be checking to make sure that the classes implement the contract of the interfaces they implement . 
^ because of the nature of &name it is hard to test and thus needs a good harness to be tested in. if you read the javadocs , you will see the process method . 
^ this is the one that needs testing . 
^ at the least you will need to ( preferably by friday , and no later than lunchtime saturday ) 
^ &num ) write a dummy workunit &num ) write a source for &char of these &num ) write a sink for these , checking that they all comeback . 
^ &num ) write a client that will drop arbitrary workunits , and send back dupes ( the same wu twice ) &num ) try all this out , and see what breaks . 
^ ( note this is using &name - read the sun site if the client wo n't connect to the server ) 
^ i ca n't do more work on this until this harness is written , so it is vital to get done if we are going to meet tuesday deadline . 
^ the factorisation code also needs a harness , but we can probably leave that until saturday . 
^ please email me with your progress so far , and as soon as you manage to break it so i can start debugging .
