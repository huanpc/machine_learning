^ hi , 
^ &char quick question for you ( i made a lot of tests before contacting you ) . 
^ what would be the best way to register a &name at the end of extraction ? 
^ for example i tried using regsvr32 or &name but both return same errors . 
^ &website " it raises an error box and then registers it . 
^ thanks , &name 
^ &name &name is the easiest way to share and print your photos : &website
