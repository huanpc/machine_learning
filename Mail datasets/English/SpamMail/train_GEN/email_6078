^ dear &name , 
^ in the absence of a reply ( i assume you are getting these emails and are just busy ? ) i have opened the freeserve envelope which was nothing much , just a user guide which i will take next door . 
^ &name has been getting to grips with emails and has even learned to talk to &name in txt language ! 
^ did you get the amazon book ? 
^ i hope so . 
^ i am hoping to send off thank you letters soon but people here are just as &name ; however i hope by the end of the weekend - 
^ we need to inform you that we are moving our mortgage to the co-op bank . 
^ we have to tell you because you are over &num . 
^ they may ask you to sign a form agreeing that they can take the house if we do n't pay ! 
^ it looks as if &name is coming over with the exchange this year ( april 2nd-10th ) . 
^ i will certainly arrange for him to come round sometime . 
^ it occurred to me that it would be possible for us to put him up but only if 
^ &char ) you would let him have your room and you spend a week with granny . 
^ obviously we could set up your computer there etc. . . 
^ &char ) the school think it is fair on &name . 
^ this is a big if but it 's not worth asking if you do n't agree to &char ) . 
^ we look forward to hearing from you ! 
^ love , mum & dad
