^ so just a couple of last things - i hope you will be happy to amuse yourselves in &name on sunday - i 'm afraid i 've got several deadlines that i have to satisfy , so will be working on papers etc. if you need to get in touch for any reason , home phone is &num &num &num ( i.e. &num from &name ) - office is &num . 
^ on monday , we could meet at 10am ( or later , if you prefer ) in the &name &name building - directions etc from &website off &name road . 
^ if you get a taxi , and the driver does n't know &name &name , try saying the new computer science building , opposite the vet school " . 
^ ( &name firm i use in &name is &name " - phone &num ) . 
^ if the weather is nice , walking from the guest house would take about 30mins , i would guess . 
^ i 'm afraid the bus service probably wo n't be very convenient - i think you 'd have to change bus midway . 
^ when you get to the &name , you 'll need to ask for me at reception , or phone &num ( i.e. drop first &num ) from the phone in the public area . 
^ let me know if there 's anything that i need to arrange or to tell you . 
^ see you soon
