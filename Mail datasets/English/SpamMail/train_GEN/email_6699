^ i have not been overwhelmed by volunteers so far so this is now a gentle nudge . 
^ if you can spare an afternoon we would very much like your help : &num thing prospective students ask is whether they will be able to talk to existing students at the open day . 
^ the annual computer science open &name will be held on friday july 5th from &num : &num until &num : &num and we are looking for about &num volunteers to assist for various roles . 
^ we will need part ibs who can demonstrate their group projects on &name &num machines ( if you want to show off your project and you do n't think it will work on the machines in &name &num please contact dr &name &name on &email ) . 
^ we would like part iis to also demonstrate their working projects , and part ias who would be happy to talk with potential students about your experiences of the computer science tripos . 
^ so , if you are going to be in or close to &name on the 5th and do n't mind chatting with lots of &name students , parents and teachers about what you have been doing , please let me know . 
^ you will be paid ! 
^ ( travel expenses within reason will also be paid . ) 
^ many thanks , &name
