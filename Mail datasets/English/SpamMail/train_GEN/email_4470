^ hi &name , 
^ i have a question about the practical that the demonstrator could n't help me with . 
^ i 'm getting the following error message when 'mixing-up " my &name 's: 
^ ( going from &num components to &num ) : 
^ warning [ &num ] &name : mix &num in &char has v.small &name [ &num ] in &name 
^ ( going from &num components to &num ) : 
^ warning [ &num ] &name : mix &num in &char has v.small &name [ &num ] in &name 
^ ( going from &num components to &num ) : 
^ warning [ &num ] &name : mix &num in &char has v.small &name [ &num ] in &name 
^ ( going from &num components to &num ) : 
^ warning [ &num ] &name : mix &num in &char has v.small &name [ &num ] in &name 
^ if you could explain what these error messages mean ( & also what the &name value refers to ) that would be great .
