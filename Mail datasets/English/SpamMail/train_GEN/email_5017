^ can i just confirm something quite basic about my understanding of &name ( i 'm doing slides for a talk in &name on thursday , where i 'm going to talk about robust semantics ) ? 
^ i assume that because there 's no in the tag sequence grammar , the system will parse things like : 
^ &name rains ( with &name subject ) 
^ &name &name &name &name ( with &name and &name &name args to sleeps ) 
^ but the statistical part has some info about , so this sort of analysis would be dispreferred under normal circumstances ? 
^ sorry to ask dumb questions , just want to avoid 
^ &name
