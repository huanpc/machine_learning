^ hey &name ,

^ do you know how you would set up a survey online ? 
^ i ask this as &name is doing a project where she needs to get people to fill in a survey , and to collate the results , i was wondering if you could do this using a web page . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ sure . 
^ you set up a ( form ) in html which has a number of ( input type' checkbox " ) elements , as well as a 'submit " element which is a button that sends the values of the checkboxes to some database or something . 
^ perhaps the easiest way would be to program the webpage to send the values of the checkboxes to &name 's email address . 
^ that would be pretty easy to do i think . 
^ then she could send an email to all the people she wants to complete the survey saying " go to this webpage http : / / ... 
^ you might have to help her to program it though , but you 're quite good with &name right ... ? 
^ best ,
