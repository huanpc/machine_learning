^ &name , 
^ well , you should either be headed into your last exam at this point , or possibly finished ( if you see this after thursday am ) . 
^ is always a great feeling heading out of your last exam and into summer ! 
^ hope your travels home and trip to &name go well . 
^ i spoke with &name last evening ( he was over to watch the mariner 's game ) and he is planning to pick you up at the airport - either way we 'll make sure you get in. we may wish to borrow you for a day during your stay with &name - as &name will be away at camp on the olympic peninsula on the days you are planning to be with us , and &name will be gone during the day at a u.w. soccer camp that week ( 16th on ) .
