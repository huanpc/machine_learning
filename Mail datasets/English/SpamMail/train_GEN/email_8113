^ hi everyone , 
^ welcome back and happy new year ! 
^ welcome also to &name and &name , &num new graduate students who joined the college over the christmas vacation . 
^ i just wanted to email a reminder that my regular " tutorial hours " are now on tuesdays 6-7pm in room &name . 
^ for the benefit of our new arrivals , these are regular occasions where a graduate student is able to talk to a member of the college 's teaching staff about her research , or to raise any issues ( confidentially if you wish ) , or to have me sign any forms that require tutorial authorisation . 
^ the change in the day from last term reflects the fact that many of you will be in college on tuesday evenings for &name halls now the dome has reopened . 
^ though , as ever , i 'm available at other times if the need arises - just email / phone ( my lab is number below ) and we 'll arrange a meeting . 
^ i hope &num will be kind to you and your studies . 
^ &name 
^ ps come to &name &name - it 's even better under the new dome !
