" - congratulations ! ^ " it is a revolution in my life ! " - i know . ^ " i have n't done much but some " - unnecessary statement . ^ " there is a magpie on our lawn . ^ i am looking at it right now ! " ^ -  ame . ^ is it interesting ? ^ 'my mum was secretly worried that  ame might be a drug dealer ! " ^ -  ame ! ! ! ^ i 'd just like to disclaim all ( well , some ) responsibility for certain comments contained within that e-mail . ^ all remotely unsavoury material was written by  ame ; i invented the rest . ^ 'my dad ( as a joke ) put my mum 's wedding dress on my bed the other day ! " ^ -  ame ha ! ^ amusing . ^ " i went to  ame with  ame for last weekend . ^ it was lovely and very relaxing . ^ we stayed in a very sweet little cottage . ^ we discussed the idea of us all going away after exams for a week what do you think ? " ^ - where is  ame " ? ^ yes , i would not mind leaving  ame for a while after the exams . ^ it depends who else is going though . ^ have you thought this through  ame ? ^ it 's just that " we could make it very cheap " and " we could invite loads of people " and " or somewhere " somehow sound interesting . ^ so , about  um people are descending on a very cheap cottage for a week - interesting . ^ seriously , though , i think it 's a lovely idea . ^ it might even work . ^ " had my hair cut yesterday , it is nice ( well i think so ! ) . " ^ - oh , good . ^ " what have you been doing ? ^ how is your revision going ? " ^ - i have been revising organic chemistry for a week ( this is the first time in my life i 've studied the topic , which is about a third of my degree , and i 'm pleased to say i am enjoying it and it is rather interesting ! ) . ^ i have also been moping over the demise of  ame and the ascendancy of  ame . ^ oh dear , change again . ^  ame really ought to have tried harder . ^ the mass populace (  ame ) thinks she 's old and past-it . ^  ame seems to have all the appeal these days . ^ " when does the third  ame 's instalment get paid ? " ^ - the third  ame 's instalment does n't just " get paid " , ( our flat account cannot , sadly , stretch to that ) you pay it . ^ okay ,  ound;  um is due ( rather , will be deducted from your account by direct debit ) on wednesday the 25th of april  um . ^ that is in  um days . ^ " failure to pay rent in the aforesaid manner , without good reason , will result in a late fee of  ound;  um being levied and interest being charged at  um above the then current base rate of  ame  ame  ame from the date due . " ( excerpt from  ame  ame 's contract  um . ) ^ in addition to the  ame 's fee , our termly flat fee of  ound;  um is due at your earliest convenience . ^ well , today i had a lazy morning as i was tired from  um hours travelling yesterday - we did n't get home until  ame last night . ^ i then did a small amount of studying this afternoon . ^ i am shortly going outside ( it 's very windy weather , but otherwise pleasant ) to build a step up to our house . ^ i will be using cement for the first time in my life ! ^ would you like to chat online sometime ? ^  ame and i may be doing so this evening at 7pm . ^ whenever is convenient , send me an e-mail . ^ i 'm looking forward to seeing you soon , ^  ame ^  ame when are you going back up to  ame ? </text_normal></message_body></message>
