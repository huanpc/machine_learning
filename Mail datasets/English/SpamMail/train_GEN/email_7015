^ hello fellow &name &name , 
^ i hope you 're all doing ok . 
^ it appears that there will be a train strike on thursday . 
^ that means that getting to &name on the train will be impossible . 
^ it would be possible however to get there by coach but i would probably need to book it as they would be quite full . 
^ it takes &num hours although &num of those are at &name so it would only actually be &num hours on the coach . 
^ it 's probably cheaper than the train too and has the advantage of taking us all the way to &name . 
^ it would be cheaper if we had student coach cards but there may not be time to get them and may not be worth &pound; &num if you do n't travel by coach much . 
^ thus , i have a few questions ; does anyone mind travelling by coach if we have to ? 
^ would you rather get a return by coach which would be cheaper than getting a single and then a single on the train back or would you rather travel back with everyone else on the train even if it costs a bit more ? 
^ personally i 'd rather come back on the train as i generally prefer trains to buses . 
^ does anyone have a national express student card ? 
^ does anyone have a better idea ? 
^ i 'm not sure if anyone else is doing anything about this as &name &char is now at &name and asked me to check out coach times but i thought i 'd better do as much research as i can . 
^ if i could have a contact number as well that would be great as i could contact you quickly if anything came up . 
^ thanks . 
^ see you soon . 
^ i hope you 're all looking forward to it . 
^ i am .
