^ g'day , 
^ how nice to hear from you . 
^ &name ) just wondered how things were going and whether you 'd seen the &name ) following . 
^ things are going well here , though still somewhat hectic . 
^ i was away for last week visiting our lab in &name , and will be off to &name next week . 
^ i had n't seen the paper you sent me , but want to , thanks for the info . 
^ can you send me your address in &name ? 
^ we are sending out christmas cards from work ... 
^ &name ) i 'm thinking of visiting &name &name et &name on the week of &name ) march 19th , btw , 
^ please come and visit us too ( we 're right next door ) . 
^ &name 
^ &name ) natural language semantics &num ( &num ) : &num , &num .  
^ , a)( &char &name &name ) academic publishers 
^ &name ) on reference to kinds in indonesian 
^ &name ) &name &name &name college , university of &name ) &name , &name &name , &name &name , ca &num , &name e-mail : &name ) &email 
^ &name ) &name &name ? 
^ &char ( &name theory of noun &name ) denotations , formalized in the nominal mapping parameter , makes &name ) the prediction that no language will have both a generalized &name ) classifier system and a singular - plural contrast in &name ) nouns . 
^ evidence presented in this note suggests that indonesian &name ) is just such a language . 
^ the evidence is used to raise the more &name ) general issue of the extent to which the morphosyntax of nouns &name ) can be reliably predicted from the routes by which they are &name ) mapped into their denotations ( and vice versa ) . 
^ unless this paper is talking about one of the many smaller languages , then i think it is a mis-analysis : &name indonesian ( like malay ) does not have a regular morphological singular / plural distinction . 
^ but i should find the paper and actually read it before i comment :- ) .
