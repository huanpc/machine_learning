^ the &name tour ? 
^ &name on . 
^ first off , let me say that we are moving the dates of the tour in the &name , &name i know it sucks for the people that have bought tickets but your tickets will be honored at all of the new dates . 
^ reason why for the move you may be asking ? 
^ our intentions were to have more dates in the &name and have some european dates too , as well as do the united states too . 
^ so to make everyone happy we needed to shift some dates around . 
^ we 're sorry for any headaches that this may cause , but we have something special planned for the &name dates because of the confusion . 
^ the corn ex. website says it 's been moved to 24th april - which will be after the start of next term - such a long wait . ...
