^ you know all this but i 'll say it anyway : &name was referring to spiritual life answers ... lets face facts &name , as much as you love computers , they do n't provide the answer to salvation or make you right with &name now do they ? 
^ nor does knowing how to get water from a cactus ... 
^ i therefore hold to the original statement that the &name does hold the answers to what we really need - ie the revelation that &name is our saviour , we can obtain forgiveness through him and learn more of &name as a result of the whole process ... etc we may still have big questions , but essentially , what we need to know &name reveals to us through his word , and any more is revealed through the working of his spirit in us ... we may not always see or find the answers , but &name does have them ... 
^ and , yes , &name has given us brains to work out the practicalities of life ... 
^ see y' all soon , love &name x

^ even though the &name does n't have all the answers , it has all the answers we need and &name has all the answers - does anyone disagree ?

^ though undoubtedly true in some sense , this appears to me a somewhat ambiguous statement . 
^ for example , in order to work my computer i need electricity , and so i might ask where i can get it from . 
^ in this case , the &name does not have the answer i need , ie from the socket in the wall . 
^ indeed , the &name does not even have the answer to the more fundamental question of what electricity is , and how one might go about generating it . 
^ furthermore , the &name does not have the answer to the question of how one gets water from the root of a cactus if one found oneself stranded in the middle of the &name desert - a question one might seriously need to know the answer to if one were in such a position . 
^ my point here is to say that in a very real sense , the &name does not have all the answers we need ; perhaps that is why we have brains - to work out the rest . 
^ i look forward to your response ,
