^ lets define some characteristics for him and possibly invent some situations and stories in which he takes part . ^ any ideas ? ^ for starters , where did he come from ? ^ - well , i got him is the sale at  ame  ame - the  um nearest to  ame . ^ not much inspiration for stories there ! ! ^ he has a tale all about himself on the little label that was on him . ^ tells you he has a sister and baby brother . ^ he 's not old enough to go to school yet , so stays at home and plays with his favourite toy ( i think it 's a toy rabbit ) all day . ^ how sad that i can remember all that ! ! ^ we could use that as the basis of a story , but make it more exciting . ^ get your inventive brain in gear  ame ! ^ well , i asked  ame in your flat if we could store our freezer contents in your freezer . ^ she said absolutely not , promptly pulled out a revolver , and shot me right between the eyes ^ - it would n't have surprised me ! ^ no , honestly , i am shocked at such terrible accusations against my lovely flatmate . ^ no ! ^ really  ame , you should n't believe such fantastically unrealistic tales ! ^ dear , dear , dear ! ^ you 're just so gullible ! ^ ( just kidding ! ) ^ - cheeky boy . ^ have you been putting brylcreem in your hair ( random question ^ - just popped into my head ! ) ? ? ^ when i finally got around to retrieving our frozen food ,  ame had gone home ! ^ so had  ame ! ^ your flat was deserted ! ! ! ^ i was in dire straits , so  ame . . . . ... ^ - promptly said " oh bother " ? ? ? ^ and tripped over your own feet ? ^ sounds feasible to me ! ^ so , your flat now has about  um kilos of our frozen chips , along with multiple loaves of bread ! ^ - oooohhhh . ... thanks  ame . ^ that will do us sevreal meals next term ! ^ now  ame , perhaps you can reassure me here |  ame happened to mention that the fee for storage in your freezer was  ound;  um per hour . ^ this did not concern be greatly as i assumed she was joking , and even if she had turned out to be serious , it would only have cost us about  ound;  um . ^ however , now that we are utilising your storage facilities over christmas , it would cost our flat  ound;  um . ^ this would lower our flat bank account balance by about  um - not a healthy way to start the term ! ^ - i would not presume to speak for  ame . ^ i hope she was serious . ^ if so , she is a very shrewd business woman and deserves a medal for spotting a chance not to be missed . ^ well done  ame ! ^ that will pay our food bills next term . ^  ame , on a serious note , i do n't understand why she and  ame did n't defrost our freezer . ^ they said they would before they left . ^  ame . . . . . . . . . . . ... well , she obviously decided that the loss we 'd make by keeping it on during the holidays would be amply rewarded by the rent fees  ame i would be paying us . ^  ame  um  ame ! ^ anyway ,  ame is quite cold . ^ this afternoon my room was  um degrees  ame , and it was sunny . ^ - this morning , i ca n't complain of the temperature in our house . ^ my room is currently running at  um degrees  ame my  um new  ame alarm clock tells me so . ^ it is really cool ! ^ i got it functioning with  um  ame batteries , and discovered that it is a " count-down " clock . ^ obviously intended for the millennium , but you can change the target date so there is a countdown to a different day . ^ so , sadly enough , i have set it to the beginning of next term . ^  har is a really lush clock though - such an exciting present , although not as great as my camera . ^ speaking of which , i am not " anxious for christmas to come " . ^ what do you think i am ? ^ i 'm excited for christmas to come . ^ that is an ntirely different thing . ^  ame does seem a lot warmer than you would expect a city of such latitudes to be . ^ since you did a-level geography perhaps you could explain this ? ^ - no. a-level geography has nothing to do with it . ^  ame ! ! ! ^ you 've got a camera ! ^ cool ! ^ i 'll look forward to seeing it sometime next term . ^ - 'sometime " next term ? ^ it 'll probably be one of the first things you see next term ! ^ you must be anxious for christmas to come . ^ see previous comment . ^ . . . . ... i am of the widely held opinion that this was really self-induced tiredness . . . . . ... ^ i agree . ^ . . . ... i then read some of a book , which  ame gave me for christmas , until 1am in the morning . . . . ... ^ is it interesting ? ^ i am going to read lots ( ! ) of books these hols as i 've not read for ages . ^ i have started reading 'men are from  ame , women are from  ame " . ^ it 's pretty interesting stuff . ^ i then slept " till this morning and went to church , where my dad was preaching this morning . ^ after that we came home and had lunch , went a walk this afternoon and then i played the piano etc. ^ - ditto , except for the piano part . </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ i 'm working in my dad 's bookshop on </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ wednesday and friday this week so that should give me a little break from the pursuit of academia . ^ the shop is in  ame , is n't it ? ^  ame , if we 're ever up that way during the holidays , i 'm going to come and find it ! </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ well , now that i have finished tearing your email apart , i shall tell you what i am up to . ^ i got up relatively early today (  um ) and having read the papers , messed on for a while doing odd bits and  ame , anf then checked email . ^ this afternoon , i have to design a leaflet to put in some gospels which we are going to post through people 's doors . ^ it is a millennium mission type thing that the church has been planning , and we have  um copies to distribute . ^ i haver to design a bookmarky thingy to put inside each - advertising the church , and with some message on it encouraging people to read them . ^ i have to get it finished before  um tonight , as dad is going to  ame then , and he needs to " approve " the finished copy . ^ he 's not back untl wed night , by which time we ( me , mam ,  ame and others from the church who have offered their help ) will have organised all the gospels ( ie , shoved a bookmark in each and then put them in envelopes ) ready for distribution . ^ i 'm going to be busy ! ! ^ well , i 'd better get on . ^ dad needs the machine ! ^ bye for now - hope the chemistry is " fun " ! ^ from  ame ^ get more from the web . ^ free  ame explorer download :  ebsite </text_normal></message_body></message>
