^ i might go shopping next week i dont know . 
^ the healthy thing might last cause i actually like swimming . 
^ i bought some clothes this week . 
^ i got a dress from &name and it cost me &pound; &num . 
^ its black and has a flower print down the left hand side . 
^ it comes past my knees and has tassels at the bottom . 
^ its nicer than it sounds trust me . 
^ the only problem is if i 'll ever get an occasion to wear it without lokking overdressed . 
^ i dont know if &name is appropriate for a wedding or not . 
^ i also got a very naken top for &name . 
^ its kind of a halter neck thing but it has no back only about &num straps across the back .
