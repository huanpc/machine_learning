^ hi &name , just thought i 'd better let you know that i 'm not all that well now ( ! ) so i apologise if i 'm slow at replying to emails and doing post-concert stuff ... having said that , do n't just stop writing emails to me- the extra time in bed not working may well just give me more time to think about these things &smiley praise &name that the timing of our illnesses was such that at least one of us was on hand to sort things out ! 
^ see you , love &name
