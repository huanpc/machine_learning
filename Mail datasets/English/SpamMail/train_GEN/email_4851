^ sorry for the late reply . 
^ i did test the code with a few different predicates and tuple descriptions . 
^ i cannot say that all the predicates and functions were tested . 
^ but i did try different combinations , etc. in the end , i left the &name file as it was when we worked with &name . 
^ sorry about that . 
^ i did not think about leaving it as it was when i was done . 
^ i might get to some more testing if i get time tomorrow . 
^ see you on monday . 
^ and this is a great job that you have done .
