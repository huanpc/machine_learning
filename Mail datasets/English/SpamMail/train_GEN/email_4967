^ hi professor &name , 
^ i talked to you at &name in september about my application to &org . 
^ i told you that i applied last year and did not get in , but that i was reapplying this year . 
^ you explained to me that the admissions process at &org works so that professors vote for students that they thought should be admitted . 
^ you also told me to let you know when i had completed my application , so that you could take a look at it . 
^ i just wanted to let you know that my application is now complete and has just been submitted . 
^ &name and &name 's references will probably arrive later this week ( my references on record are probably from last year ) . 
^ i hope all is well - i have heard that you are now beginning to think about &name * in more detail . 
^ &name
