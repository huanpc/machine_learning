^ &name &name , 
^ thanks for your e-mail , it 's really good to hear from you . 
^ you 've surely not found any nightlife yet if you 've time to send me a message on a friday evening . 
^ &name not much new this week , apart from &name little food allergy attack on wednesday night . 
^ &name came home from his work and we were only having sandwiches for our supper , but he decided to open a tin of &name lentil soup . 
^ we both ate it and within an hour &name 's face was swollen , he had a red rash all over and his throat was closing . 
^ he went to the hospital where he saw a doctor and he reckoned it was the soup . 
^ its the only thing we have n't ate for years . 
^ a bit strange . 
^ if it happens again then they will test him to see what the cause is . 
^ he has pills to take if he has another attack . 
^ so thats about all the exciting stuff . 
^ &name and &name say &name to you . 
^ how are you getting on with your lectures ? 
^ have you fallen asleep yet ? 
^ will you give &name my e-mail address and tell her to write sometime . 
^ have you found any rich bits of stuff yet ?
