^ hi ... 
^ the attached patch replaces the current &name permission &name with the &name + advanced permissions that i proposed last week . 
^ i would appreciate it if other people could test it thoroughly since number of possible permission settings together with the different behaviour on executable files , regular files , directories and mixed lists of file items makes it very difficult ( if not impossible ) to test all code paths . 
^ i appreciate other feedback as well , of course . 
^ &smiley 
^ when you think that you found a bug , please reload the directory in &name and try again , since there are several bugs in &name that look like errors in the permissions &name , especially with recursive permission changes ( see bugs # &num and # &num ) . 
^ bye ...
