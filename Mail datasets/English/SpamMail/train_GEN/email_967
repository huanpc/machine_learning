^ ok &name . 
^ i 've done it for you . 
^ each cell in column &char contains a formula that calculates the new balance based on the existing balance and the new transactions . 
^ this relies on an initial balance being in cell h7 . 
^ when you create new rows , you simply copy the whole of the previous row down , which automatically copies the correct formula into cell hx where &char is the new row number . 
^ you can also " fill " the formula downwards to cover existing rows .
