^ i find out my results tomorrow . ^ anyway , on to dealing with some of the other issues you raised last time : ^ 'saying that radiometric dating is unreliable is as silly as saying radio waves are unreliable ( when you change to channel  um , you usually get something with pictures and sound , unless there is a freak weather situation ) . ^ likewise dating . ^ i 'm sorry - i do n't agree . ^ we know that t.v. signals give us sound and pictures - it is observed ( i.e. 'science ) . ^ however , the ages of these rocks are not observed - nobody has sat down with a stop-watch ever since the rock formed , and timed how long it has existed ! ^ what is observed is simply the ratio of certain isotopes in the rock - but it is only faith , pure and simple , to then claim that this tells us the age of the rock ! ^ now that faith may or may not be reasonable , but that 's all it is - the age is not observed , and therefore is n't science . ^ since , then , these dates cannot be confirmed scientifically ( i.e. through observation ) , and hence are by definition unprovable hypotheses ( no scientist was there when they formed ) , to suggest they are inaccurate is totally different to suggesting radio waves are inaccurate . ^ notice that creationists do n't claim that the observed facts ( i.e. the isotope ratios ) are wrong - merely that the interpretation of these facts is wrong ! ^ the radio waves analogy is therefore totally inappropriate . ^ " when several different decay schemes are used on the same rock , each with its own different half life , and give the same age ( concordance ) the method ca n't be said to be false . ^ before i write anything else , i would be genuinely interested to know of some examples where all the different decay schemes , used on the same rock , gave the same age . ^ if you know of any , please could you tell me ? ^ thanks . ^ now , before we go any further , i 'd just like to point out the assumptions that radiometric-dating methods make : ^  um no amount of parent element has entered the rock since it formed , ^  um no amount of parent element has left the rock since it formed , ^  um no amount of daughter element has entered the rock since it formed , ^  um no amount of daughter element has left the rock since it formed , ^  um radioactive decay rates of the isotopes in the rock have always been identical to those values now possessed by those isotopes in modern laboratories . ^  um the concentration of parent and daughter elements in the rock when it formed is known . ^ obviously , not one of these assumptions is provable ! ^ but , more to the point , no.  um has much evidence against it . ^ " the half lives of some decay schemes are among the most precisely measured constants in physics - e.g. the caesium clock which now replaces our world 's measurement of time . ^ very true . ^ however , what makes you think these half-lives have always been the same ? ^ on what authority is this assumed ? ^ the  ame ? ^ science ? ^ or just blind faith ? ^ i suspect the latter . ^  ame , experiments actually show that , contrary to school physics lessons , radioactive half-lives do depend on the conditions the isotope experiences . ^ and not only that , but it is well known that they are inversely proportional to the speed of light . ^ now , it is an indisputable fact that , over the years , measurements of the speed of light have shown a steady decrease , not only amongst all the measurements in general , but also amongst each method of "  har measurement in particular (  har speed of light ) . ^ one may like to blame this fact on increasing accuracy of measuring devices , but that does not explain why earlier measurements consistently fell above the present value , rather than being equally spread above and below . ^ also , many other physical " constants are dependant on  har ;  um were examined in a paper by  ame  ame , who showed that  um should have remained constant ,  um increased , and  um decreased if  ame ( "  har decay , i.e. decrease in the speed of light ) were true . ^ he found that the measured values of each one over time confirmed the prediction ! ^ even in the case of radioactive decay rates , where  um elements were examined ,  um /  um of the results showed decreasing decay rates , just as would be predicted by  ame . ^ so then , why is n't  ame observed now ? ^ well , the answer is in your statement : " the caesium clock' now replaces our world 's measurement of time . ^ indeed it does . ^ the second is defined by the vibration of caesium atoms ; but the vibration of caesium atoms is proportional to the speed of light ! ^ hence , if  ame were true , we would expect no variation when compared with caesium clocks , since these should vary in exactly the same way ! ^ however , there should be an observable difference with mechanical clocks ( e.g. the time it takes moons to travel around planets , etc. ) . ^ and , guess what , the atomic clock has been shown to be slowing down relative to these ! ^ in fact , a secular russian scientist , by the name of  ame , has independently come to the conclusion that the speed of light was much faster in the past ( as various other physicists are also thinking now ) . ^ this proves that the idea is not creationist " folk science . ^ obviously , if half-lives were much smaller in the past , atoms would decay much faster , giving a false appearance of age ( if we assume that  har has always been constant , that is ) . ^ this also explains why we can see the light from stars which are millions of light-years away . ^ 'dating can go wrong - things such as weathering , or reheating rocks above their  ame temperature ( which resets their clocks ) can occur - but they are the analog of the freak weather conditions in the tv example - understandable situations which can usually be checked . ^ i 'd suggest that that would be quite hard , since we ca n't go back to the time when they formed and have a look ! ^ however , i know of various examples where the methods went totally wrong : ^  ebsite dating of  ame  ame 's "  um man gave the result of  um million years . ^ this was  um times to high for evolutionists to accept , so they redated the same strata using the same method and came up with the more " acceptable value of  um million years . ^  ame , is n't it , how the same method on the same strata can give an answers divergent by  um million years ? ^ and strange , too , how they 'll date it until it agrees with evolutionary speculation ? ^ but that 's not the end of the story - later digs convinced anthropologists that even this date was too large . ^ new dating of the strata gave the answer of  um million years ! ^ great how the date always miraculously changes whenever the evolutionists want it to ! ^  um it 's a similar story with the "  ame ramidus fossils . ^ most samples of the basalt closest to the fossil-bearing strata gave dates of about  um million years . ^ however , this was deemed " too old , so they examined basalt further removed from the fossils , and selected  um out of  um samples to arrive at a date of  um million years . ^ the other  um samples were discarded , since they again gave much greater ages . ^ see how the 'dating game works ? ^  um  um historical andesite lava flows from  ame  ame in  ame  ame are known ( by observation , i.e. science ) to have occurred in  um ,  um in  um , and one in  um . ^ however ,  har -  ame 'dating gave values from  um to  um million years ! ^ with hindsight , it was argued that excess argon was retained in the rock when it solidified ( and the secular literature contains many similar examples where excess argon vastly inflated the ages of rocks of a known age ) . ^ so , if excess argon can skew the dates of rocks whose ages we know , how can we use this method to date rocks whose date we do n't know ? ^  um  ame sample  um from the moon gave a date of  um billion years by the  ame / helium method ;  um billion years by the  ame method ; and greater than  um billion years by the  ame method . ^ that 's a divergence of over  um billion years ! ^ similarly , sample  um was dated several times by the  ame method . ^ the lowest such value was ^  um  um billion years ( far too old for orthodox geology anyway ) , but the highest ,  um billion years ! ! ! ^ that 's a difference of  um billion years ! ^ can you see now why , as a scientist ,  um cannot accept radiometric dating methods as either accurate or authoritative ? ^ i 'd like to introduce a better way of dating :  ame 's time scale ( as found in the  ame ) . ^ who knows , he might turn out to be right after all ! ^ " i also do n't believe our  ame plays silly games with us . ^ he would not give us the gift of scientific enquiry only to turn round and say -  ame ha ! ^ i only put those old-looking fossils there to fool you . ^ i think a lot of the problems people with a young earth viewpoint have stem with a fear that  um day science may pull the carpet of faith from under them . ^ but if  ame has made everything , science will never undermine what he 's done or prove he did n't do it ! ^ indeed , science does n't undermine christianity . ^ science proved  ame correct : ^  ame  um :  um he stretcheth out the north over the empty place , and hangeth the earth upon nothing . ^ science had to catch up with the  ame to see that this was true . ^ it is catching up with the  ame and showing the earth is n't very old ( although this is being hidden from most people ) . ^ if creationism is such bad science , as most claim , why do you think that evolutionists admit that creationists have won most of the public debates on the subject ? ^ why are the media so reluctant to let the public hear the evidence against evolution ? ^ are they scared that people might actually start believing  ame and his word ? ^ you mention 'silly games . ^ now , let us just for  um minute assume that  ame could have created  ame and  ame as fully grown human beings . ^ would this be a 'silly game ? ^  ame forbid . ^ but 'science would tell us that they would have to be at least  um years old to be fully grown ! ^ if  ame were to chop down the tree of knowledge of good and evil , he would find rings . ^ 'science would tell us that it must therefore be  um year old ; but it would have been created only a week before ! ^ would this be a 'silly game on  ame 's part ? ^ of course not . ^ the only 'silly game here is to dictate to  ame how he had to have created the world ; to force our own assumptions onto the evidence , and then declare that  ame did n't really mean what he wrote . ^ " i think a lot of the problems people with a young earth viewpoint have stem with a fear that  um day science may pull the carpet of faith from under them . ^ if this were the case , do n't you think they 'd jump on the bandwagon of modern scientific fashions to prevent this accusation being thrown at them ? ^ i suspect they would . ^ i feel the real reason for this debate is simply that the media and academic establishment brainwashes children from birth that the earth is millions of years old , and we evolved from inanimate chemical soup . ^ this is so ingrained that it is very difficult to relinquish the idea - and besides , to do so would bring ridicule from one 's peers . ^ so , as the  ame does n't publish critical articles against people , and nor does it ostracise people from the scientific establishment , people feel they are at liberty to bend its words to fit the ideas of men . ^ " besides , it thought , 'surely all these scientists ca n't be wrong ? ^ " yea , let  ame be true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged . ^ ( romans  um :  um ) ^  ame , i strongly suggest that you look at how these dating methods are inaccurate , and that you let the  ame dictate the truth to you . ^  ame 's word had always been unpopular - today as much as ever . ^ "  har  ame , keep that which is committed to thy trust , avoiding profane and vain babblings , and oppositions of science falsely so called : which some professing have erred concerning the faith . ^  ame be with thee . ^ amen . ^ (  um  ame  um :  um &  um ) ^ i pray that  ame might show you the truth . ^ your friend and brother , ^  ame . </text_normal></message_body></message>
