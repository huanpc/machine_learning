^ dear &name , 
^ everything is entirely my fault . 
^ please forgive me . 
^ i did send out an e-mail to my team and it was that e-mail that i was using . 
^ i am very sorry . 
^ i did not realise that the line at the end sounded discourteous . 
^ i am so sorry . 
^ it was included because &name said that we needed to tell people that we " would n't make any reciprocal agreements " . 
^ again , i 'm sorry . 
^ i 'm silly and inexperienced . 
^ and about to cry . . . ... was n't it the town tickets that were going to be collected on the door ? ... i 'm sure we said this at some stage in a meeting where i said something about a stamped self-addressed envelope and you said it was unnecessary because they could be collected on the door . 
^ the spelling mistake was also my fault . 
^ a lot of e-mails ( to churches ) have already gone out with the fact that town tickets 
^ can be collected on the door . . ... what do you want me to do about it ? 
^ i 'm so 
^ sorry , &name . 
^ i really am . 
^ please forgive me . 
^ by the way : i sent a personal ( as in from me and not &name or anyone else ) apology to mr. &name . 
^ i hope that was n't the wrong thing to do too . ...

^ ok , firstly mr. &name as far as i can see was just trying to be helpful and give a word of caution , since he realised that the e-mail was going out all over the place and did n't want offence to be caused . 
^ so i think he wo n't take it any further , but was just trying to offer some very sensible advice . 
^ secondly , please remind all your admin team that everyone is doing this as a favour , and e-mails all need to be courteous , polite and respectful in manner , from the salutation , to the end of the signature . 
^ each word should be very carefully considered . 
^ spelling and grammar should also be checked ! 
^ tickets will not be collectible on the door - there will be over &num of them ! 
^ try collectable . 
^ and they probably wo n't be anyway . 
^ get your order in soon enough and they 'll be delivered to you , unless you live our at &name &name or something . 
^ with this in mind , it might be worth you drafting out an e-mail to give to your publicity team to send out . 
^ i personally would omit completely the offending paragraph , but you may wish to contact &name before doing so . 
^ thanks for forwarding this to me and do keep me informed if anything else happens . 
^ i doubt any further problems will arise with respect to this incident , but do please tread carefully . 
^ take care , 
^ love &name
