^ and did you know .. i am doing a full-time german course as well ! 
^ things are gonna be really hard ! 
^ wish me luck mate. . 
^ my mum 's yelling at me to get to the dining table for lunch catch ye &num &name 
^ hi &name ! 
^ hows ya ? 
^ it 's been ages since i last heard & i 've been meaning to write for a while . 
^ glad you got my postcard - i 'm surprised they forwarded it to &name , &name i only paid postage enough for &name , so i thought you 'd get it at college . 
^ anyways , it 's got to you . 
^ you been up to much over the vac ? 
^ other than &name i also had a week in &name with my family , staying with relatives and friends . 
^ then spent time relaxing , doing volunteer work , &name ( non comp-sci stuff &smiley ) , bit of programming ( that code i did for innosetup , the author is looking at adopting for the main project which is cool ) etc. went to one of the &name &name earlier in august with some girls from &name which was cool . 
^ i am however like you really looking forward to next year . 
^ it 'll be good to be back in &name and in the midst of it all ! 
^ &name for pointing out that the lecture list is out - it makes an interesting read ( and it 's impressive to show relatives &name &name 's concise lecture list and demonstrate that i actually understand it ! ) . 
^ not much in the &name &name in &name ( except practicals ) & no saturday lectures in &name . 
^ but &name &name every saturday in &name is a bit much ! 
^ &name . 
^ law & economics seems to be a new course - i ca n't find reference to it in previous years material . 
^ could be interesting , especially with &name &name ( who you 'll probably have heard of , especially if you are a slashdot person ) . 
^ the artificial intelligence course i 've been told by a comp . 
^ sci . 
^ lecturer at a college near me ( a family friend ) will be quite hard , so it 's worth doing the extra reading . 
^ and do n't miss my &name 's lectures on graphics &smiley the group project should be cool , i 'm quite looking forward to that , and also &name theory & complexity . 
^ security could be really interesting or really dull - i guess only time will tell ! 
^ still , for someone who got a 1st , i 'm sure you 'll fly through the year with a breeze ;- ) . 
^ only jokin " - i know you worked hard for it . 
^ did i tell you that when i got the breakdown of my marks , my &name noted that it was the &name maths that really brought me down & i should be fine for a &num : &num next year ? 
^ and have you had a chance to read your bible or talk to &name over the summer ? 
^ i was reading a great passage yesterday - " praise be to the &name and father of our &name &name &name ! 
^ in his great mercy he has given us a new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of &name &name from the dead , and into an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade - kept in heaven or you , who through faith are shielded by &name 's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time . " . 
^ because although we do n't deserve anything , &name sent ( " in his great mercy " ) his &name &name to die on the cross and then rise from the dead , so we can be forgiven ( " a new birth " ) and receive eternal life in heaven ( " an inheritance that can never perish , spoil or fade " ) . 
^ that 's pretty amazing &name ! 
^ how are things in your part of the world ? 
^ schools start again this week here , so things are getting back into order after the summer and things running as usual . 
^ weather 's good , but we 're told is to deteriorate . 
^ and the politicians are bickering as per usual . 
^ somethings just do n't change ! 
^ anyway , gotta go - cya soon ,
