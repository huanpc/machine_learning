regional constraint-based grammar group will be meeting at the  rg of the university of  ame ,  ame on wednesday , october 23rd . ^ the meeting will be from 10am to  um pm and the schedule is the following : ^ *  um : tutorial session :  ame  ame - university of  ame an introduction to practical  ame using constraint-based grammars ^ #  um : coffee / tea pause ^ *  um :  ame  ame - university of  ame japanese syntactic verb-verb compounding and grammatical information spreading in  ame ^ *  um :  ame  ame - university of  ame  ame  ame constructions : description and representation in an  ame large grammar ^ #  um : lunch ^ *  um : tutorial session :  ame  ame - university college  ame  ame grammar as a constraint-based theory of language ^ #  um : coffee / tea pause ^ *  um :  ame  ame - university of  ame getting a grip on combinators :  ame  ame categorial grammar ^ *  um :  ame  ame - university of  ame  ame and  ame ^ #  um : business meeting / planning ^ the meeting will be in  ame and will take place in the  ame  ame building , where the  rg has found a new home recently . ^ details on how to get here can be found on  ebsite / . ^ once in the building , go to the reception ( just in front of the main entrance ) and you will get directed to room fw11 where the meeting will be held . ^ please distribute this message to all of those that you think might be interested . ^ if you are planning to come , please let us know . ^ looking forward to seeing you here , ^  ame  ame and  ame  ame - local organizers ^  ame : ^  ame  ame , word grammar as a constraint-based theory of language . ^ i shall introduce the  um most general and controversial ideas of  ame : ^  um that language is a ( conceptual ) network . ^  um that information is exploited by means of (  har ) spreading activation and (  har ) multiple default inheritance . ^  um that sentence structure is based on rich word-word dependencies rather than on phrase structure . ^ i shall show how these ideas relate the goal of modelling human competence and performance , but i shall also consider how they relate to some of the goals of  ame . ^  ame  ame , getting a grip on combinators :  ame  ame categorial grammar in the  ame categorial grammar (  ame ) framework , syntactic patterns arise as the result of the interaction of complex , directionally specified categories with a small set of rules that merge these categories together . ^ while  ame provides a theory of grammar in which nearly all  ame variation is found in the lexicon , it nonetheless is frequently necessary to place language-specific restrictions on the applicability of the rules to ensure that ungrammatical sequences cannot be derived . ^ in this talk , i will show how the more fine-grained conception of the categorial slash provided by the categorial type logic tradition of categorial grammar can be utilized to rid  ame of rule restrictions and endow the theory with greater explanatory power . ^ i will show how the control that is obtained by this move simplifies previous  ame accounts of english and dutch and how it provides a  ame account of syntactic extraction asymmetries in english ,  ame , and  ame  ame . ^  ame  ame , an introduction to practical  ame using constraint-based grammars . ^ starting with a very brief overview of the state-of-art in  ame , i will discuss the need for deep processing in some applications and motivate the use of constraint-based grammars for parsing and generation . ^ i will mention some issues that arise when developing large grammars and briefly talk about semantic representation . ^ specific examples will be taken from the  ame grammars and grammar engineering tools which are freely available and which have been used as components of several applications , including commercially deployed systems . ^  ame  ame ,  ame  ame constructions : description and representation in an  ame large grammar the keystone of any  ame application with decent to large coverage is arguably its lexicon . ^ it is obvious that any such lexicon that would only contain simple words would undermine the overall quality of a system . ^ recent experiments were carried out to account for multiword expressions in the  ame english resource grammar , a large-scale bi-directional grammar of english in the  ame framework . ^  ame  ame constructions are  um particular type of multiword expression that has special properties partly predictable . ^ i will present them and provide a description of them very much based on a wider definition than traditionally used in the literature . ^ in that perspective , i shall discuss how  ame verb constructions can be represented syntactically as well as semantically and the advantages of such a representation for further processing . ^  ame  ame , japanese syntactic verb-verb compounding and grammatical information spreading in  ame japanese has  um related verb-verb compound constructions . ^ one is purely lexical , but the other  um ( syntactic compounds " ) show varying degrees of syntactic independence : the  um verbs (  ame ,  ame ) are distinct syntactic terminals . ^ the syntactic compounds are classified into  um types by the properties of  ame (  ame  um ,  ame  um ) , (  um ) the unaccusative , (  um ) the transitive and (  um ) the serial verb type . ^ the serial verb type forms a complex predicate in syntax , so that it is challenging to the framework like  ame . ^ the paper analyses the structural relations between  ame ,  ame within  ame and  ame 's (  um ) information spreading approach in  ame . ^ this architecture allows more flexible grammatical information sharing among c-structure nodes by dividing the information into naturrl classes . ^ under this proposal ,  ame clause is a sentential subj of  ame in the unaccusative type and an  ame in the transitive type . ^ in the serial verb type ,  um verbs are serialised under the  har node in c-structure and  ame shares the only grammatical relations with its mother , namely the whole  ame compound . ^ moreover ,  ame clause is a pseudo-complement , i.e. semantic argument ,  ame of  ame . ^  ame  ame ,  ame and underspecification this paper suggests that the principles that regulate valence demands do not directly resolve the feature neutrality of heads or their dependents , but instead resolve feature neutrality , if at all , on the phrase that the head projects . ^ coordinate structures provide the clearest evidence for this position , though other constructions in which an element may participate in multiple valence constraints support a similar conclusion . ^ this analyis preserves the useful properties of destructive strategies , while avoiding the conflicts noted by  ame  um and others . ^ an account along these lines contributes to a simpler and more transparent model theory for approaches such as  ame . </text_normal></message_body></message>
