[  um ]  um  ame , then , that those who believe are children of  ame . ^  um the scripture foresaw that  ame would justify the gentiles by faith , and announced the gospel in advance to  ame : " all nations will be blessed through you .' [  um ]  um so those who have faith are blessed along with  ame , the man of faith . ^  um all who rely on observing the law are under a curse , for it is written : "  ame is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law .' [  um ]  um clearly no one is justified before  ame by the law , because , " the righteous will live by faith .' [  um ]  um the law is not based on faith ; on the contrary , " the man who does these things will live by them .' [  um ]  um  ame redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us , for it is written : "  ame is everyone who is hung on a tree .' [  um ]  um he redeemed us in order that the blessing given to  ame might come to the gentiles through  ame  ame , so that by faith we might receive the promise of the  ame . ^  um brothers , let me take an example from everyday life . ^ just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established , so it is in this case . ^  um the promises were spoken to  ame and to his seed . ^ the scripture does not say " and to seeds , " meaning many people , but " and to your seed,' [  um ] meaning  um person , who is  ame . ^  um what i mean is this : the law , introduced  um years later , does not set aside the covenant previously established by  ame and thus do away with the promise . ^  um for if the inheritance depends on the law , then it no longer depends on a promise ; but  ame in his grace gave it to  ame through a promise . ^  um what , then , was the purpose of the law ? ^ it was added because of transgressions until the seed to whom the promise referred had come . ^ the law was put into effect through angels by a mediator . ^  um a mediator , however , does not represent just  um party ; but  ame is one . ^  um is the law , therefore , opposed to the promises of  ame ? ^ absolutely not ! ^ for if a law had been given that could impart life , then righteousness would certainly have come by the law . ^  um but the scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin , so that what was promised , being given through faith in  ame  ame , might be given to those who believe . ^  um before this faith came , we were held prisoners by the law , locked up until faith should be revealed . ^  um so the law was put in charge to lead us to  ame [  miley that we might be justified by faith . ^  um now that faith has come , we are no longer under the supervision of the law . ^  um you are all sons of  ame through faith in  ame  ame ,  um for all of you who were baptized into  ame have clothed yourselves with  ame . ^  um there is neither jew nor greek , slave nor free , male nor female , for you are all one in  ame  ame . ^  um if you belong to  ame , then you are  ame 's seed , and heirs according to the promise . ^  um [  um ] gen . ^  um :  um ^  um [  miley gen . ^  um :  um ;  um :  um ;  um :  um ^  um [  um ]  ame . ^  um :  um ^  um [  um ]  ame . ^  um :  um ^  um [  um ]  ame . ^  um :  um ^  um [  um ]  ame . ^  um :  um ^  um [  um ] gen . ^  um :  um ;  um :  um ;  um :  um ^  um [  um ] or charge until  ame came ^ lifted from an e-mail by  ame  ame ... ^ here 's just a quick explanation about the uses of curses in the  ame so hopefully verse  um will make more sense . ^ being cursed is an inevitable consequence of sin ... ^  ame  um ^  um "  ame is the man who carves an image or casts an idol--a thing detestable to the lord , the work of the craftsman 's hands--and sets it up in secret . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who dishonors his father or his mother . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who moves his neighbor 's boundary stone . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who leads the blind astray on the road . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who withholds justice from the alien , the fatherless or the widow . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who sleeps with his father 's wife , for he dishonors his father 's bed . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who has sexual relations with any animal . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who sleeps with his sister , the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who sleeps with his mother-in-law . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who kills his neighbor secretly . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! "  um "  ame is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out . " then all the people shall say , " amen ! " ^ as we all sin we all deserve to be cursed . ^  ame wants us to be free to have a relationship with him and so  ame took the curse for us . ... ^  ame  um ^  um be sure to bury him that same day , because anyone who is hung on a tree is under  ame 's curse . ^  ame  um ^  um  ame redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us , for it is written : "  ame is everyone who is hung on a tree . " ^ i hope that this makes sense . ^  ame  ame wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ hello everyone , ^ sorry it 's taken me a few days to get round to emailing you - i have been sooooooo busy this week , but now i 'm at home for a few days , so i have a bit more time now . ^ for those of you who do n't know , at  ame  ame on monday we decided that emailing the prayer points during the week would be a good idea , so we can all remember what stuff to pray for during the week , and not just on a monday night . ^ so that 's what i 'll try and do . ^ sorry if i get any facts wrong - i 'm trying to remember it all ... ^ * explore courses and  har ^ *  ame 's mum , who is ill , with pneumonia , but they are not exactly sure what else is wrong with her ^ *  ame 's grandad who is ill , and the rest of the family ^ *  ame 's brother  ame , who is still finding it difficult at school ^ * word , who are going to the  ame  ame this sunday ^ *  ame 's work ( that he does some ) , and the phd that he has applied to do ^ *  ame  ame , who is still ill ^ *  ame 's friends in flat  ame  har , that there is peace there ^ *  ame 's mum , who is feeling restless and unhappy since her children have left home , and since she retired ^ *  ame  ame - speaker ( or has that been sorted out now ? ) ^ *  ame 's summer -  ame and guidance for what he should be doing ^ see you all on monday - i think we 're doing  ame  um . ^ maybe  ame will send you an email with it on , if you 're nice to him . ^ love  ame </text_embedded><text_normal> ^  ame  ame  ame ^ st.  ame 's college ^  um  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ^ department of geological sciences university of  ame ^ mobile ( vodaphone )  um  um  um  um </text_normal></message_body></message>
