^ hi everyone , 
^ the plan is that tomorrow evening at &name prompt we 'll have our last &name of the term , and we 'll be handing over to the new reps , whose names i shall not reveal now . 
^ afterwards we 'll go to &num &name street which is the new &name rep 's room and is massive . 
^ there we 'll be just having a few nibbles but nothing huge , so eat beforehand . 
^ we will probably go straight from the meeting which finishes at &num ( in theory ! ) 
^ other than that most , if not all central meetings have now stopped , so there 's no &name or &name this week . 
^ &name many of you can make it to meeting and then the social afterwards . 
^ if not have great &name holidays ! ! ! ! 
^ &name &name
