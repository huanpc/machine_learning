^ thank you ! 
^ i 've download the new virus definition file ( dated &num / &num ) and the problem was fixed . 
^ thank you again . 
^ &name &name &name &name phone : &num &num &num &num e-mail : &email 
^ firstly , it is not a virus in &name &name , but rather a false-positive . 
^ secondly , &name have been contacted and i 'm waiting to hear their response . 
^ they usually fix false-positives in the update after they are informed . 
^ some people have reported that it seems to be ok again with the definitions from &num / &num , but with my copy of &name &num , there is still the same problem . 
^ &name &name will release very soon updates which fix this problem . 
^ yours ,

^ dear mr cornish , i 've downloaded the sfxmaker a couple of weeks ago and start using it with no problems . 
^ first off all , my congratulations ! 
^ it is a great software ! 
^ however , yesterday ( &num / &num ) , my antivirus software ( &name &name &name ) was updated and then , every time i use sfxmaker to generate an executable , the &name &name engine shows the following message : &name type : &name protection &name event : &name found ! 
^ &website &name : &char : &name &name : &name action taken : &name failed : delete succeeded &name found : &name may &num &num : &num : &num &num 
^ the message appears everytime i generate an executable , howerver , the virus was not detected in my system as a whole by the scan made by &name &name engine . 
^ it only detects it in the executable generated by &name . 
^ any clues ? 
^ could i do something to eliminate the virus ( if it actually exists in &name ) ? 
^ thanks in advance , 
^ &name &name &name &name fone : &num &num &num &num e-mail : &email
