^ hi &name ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ thanks so much for doing those parts and helping out the other night - i could n't have done it without you ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ thank you for doing all that , it 's certainly worth it &smiley

^ just a few things : 
^ the chamber organ has been booked , and will cost &pound; &num all in. the organ people will need to park their van in the car park outside &name 's chapel - apparently they 've always done this before when they 've brought the organ to &name 's. 
^ any chance you could sort this ? 
^ the guy 's name is &name &name , and he will be arriving at about 9am . 
^ on this point , do you know what time we can get into the chapel from ? 
^ it would be a huge help if we could get in early on the saturday .

^ great- thanks for sorting that ! 
^ i 'll look into it , if they 've always had this system at &name 's before , it should be a problem ... &name , do you have contact details for the domestic bursar , or do you think this is just something for you and &name to discuss with &name &name when you meet ? 
^ i can certainly be there for 9am- and i expect &name will be there early too &smiley

^ secondly , what 's the situation for post-concert party or the like ? 
^ we ca n't not have one , because as you know , people kind of expect it if they 've given up their time to come and play . 
^ equally , i appreciate that it 's not appropriate to put on a party where everyone drinks way too much like usual . 
^ if you do n't want it to be an " official " thing , then i will put something on for the performers , the only downside being that it 'll cost me a small fortune . . . ... 
^ last year we went for a curry- seemed to work well and people appreciated having something to go on to- had a good time without lots of alcohol , and there were no complaints that it was n't the usual post-concert party ! 
^ also gives time for discussing things arising from the talk- i 'm not sure how much this happened last year , but it certainly did a bit &smiley 
^ the posters look great ! 
^ i think it 's all coming together really well , so thanks for all your help .

^ yep- the publicity team are doing a grand job- and so are you ! 
^ thanks so much for all you 've done&smiley btw , have you heard from &name and &name what they 're doing about accommodation ? 
^ &name if they 're not actually staying with friends , we need to act fast ! 
^ see you soon , hope all goes well on saturday &smiley lvoe &name
