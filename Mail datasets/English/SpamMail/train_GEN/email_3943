^ dear &name , 
^ i have investigated on your behalf and have discovered that the &name household does own a wok , although it belongs to one of the other &num and not to &name . 
^ so i guess it 's up to you whether he;ll need &num or not . 
^ what are your other ideas ? 
^ &name xxx 
^ p.s. it 's beautifully sunny here this morning - i have a south-facing room this year and i 'm enjoying sitting at the computer soaking up the sun as if it were the middle of summer , especially as it 's cold outside ! 
^ p.p.s. how are you other than work ?
