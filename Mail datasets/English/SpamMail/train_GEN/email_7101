^ dear &name 
^ thank you very much for your mail dated feb &num , &num 
^ you can forward the domain to a &name using the redirection settings in the config menu under domain management at &website however if you need a &name repoint then unfortunately we will cease to be the registrar of the domain if you need the &name record changed to point to any server that is not a &name &name . 
^ this means that the domain needs to be transfered out of our servers to a different host . 
^ to cancel a domain name form your account either to remove it or to transfer is to another registrar then you can do this by logging into your account at the following location : &website

^ from here you can also cancel your package .

^ if you would like the &name changed for any of your domains as a temporary measure until a full transfer of registrar has completed then please send an email to &email with the domains to change and the &name information . 
^ this is possible for the following : .com .net .org .biz .info 
^ for .uk domains you are able to change the &name tag of the domain name using the online system and the new registrar will then change the &name for you . 
^ cancelling a domain name means that we will not renew the domain name and as such you need to perform a transfer of registrar before the expiry date or you will loose the domain name . 
^ we do not renew a domain name after it is cancelled / dns change and as such you will loose the domain name unless you transfer to another registrar before the expiry date . 
^ if you feel we may be of any further assistance , or have any other questions or queries relating to our products or services , then please do not hesitate to contact us . 
^ thank you
