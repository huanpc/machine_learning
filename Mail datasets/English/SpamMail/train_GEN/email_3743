^ dear &name , 
^ thank you for your message and all the news about what has been going on with your ph. &name application saga . 
^ i 'm sorry to hear about the funding cuts which must have been excruciating for you to hear about . 
^ and wow , what a challenge , having to scare up your own resources from companies to fund a ph. &char ! 
^ i confess i was unaware of the funding difficulties in the real sciences . 
^ i 'd assumed it was only the soft science that had little money for advanced degrees . 
^ but i hope you are heartened , in some way , by the fact that your ph. &name prospects have nothing to do with your intellectual fitness for the work , which is unquestioned . 
^ it 's frustrating that your immediate plans for next year may hinge on the vagaries of fundraising ! 
^ ( i confess i am also a bit surpried that your prospective advisor at &name has left you to do the fundraising for the project ; usually that falls to the supervisor , i 'd have thought , though i have spent much of my grad school career doing grant applications , which is the rough equivalent i suppose . ) 
^ anyway , i will definitely keep you in my prayers about all of this , and hope and trust that all will go according to &name 's plan for you for the next year . 
^ i am greatly encouraged that you 're at peace about the process , which speaks volumes about your emotional and spiritual maturity . 
^ i think i may have told you that i was turned down for a raft of ph. &name programs on the first time i applied , and was devastated . 
^ at the time , my faith was not as firmly rooted as it is now , but at least i had plenty of faithful and supportive friends to help me through . 
^ you do , too , and hopefully wo n't make the mistake that i did , which was misinterpreting not getting into some grad programs as owing strictly to my own inadequacy . 
^ i discovered , once i did get to grad school , that there is a lot more apparent randomness ( 'mystery " i think might be the preferred theological term ) to the way some things turn out than we would often like to think . 
^ i have found that in such cases , it is often only in retrospect that i can discern what &name appeared to have in mind . 
^ in any case , i hope your vocational path will soon be made more straight , as it were , and that next year will fall into place as both you and &name want . 
^ and meantime , as my dad always says , " keep the faith " -- that 's what gets us all through anyway , wherever we are , whatever we do . 
^ please do let me know how things evolve , and know that i keep you in my prayers . 
^ and let me know if i can do anything else to help ! 
^ every blessing ,
