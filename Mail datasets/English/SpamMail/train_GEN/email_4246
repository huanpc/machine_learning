^ dear all , 
^ thanks so much for willingness to serve &name as a discussion group leader in explore . 
^ it was super to see everyone so keen and gospel focussed at the tuesday lunchtime meeting . 
^ &char real sense of partnership and support as we try to help those in our groups recognise &name as &name the &name , and turn to follow him . 
^ just wanting to report back after last night , and give a couple of thoughts . 
^ we had the course in &name 's east &name , and it was a great atmosphere . 
^ &name made some great jacket potatoes and it really made for an attractive event that you would be very happy to bring a non christian to . 
^ there were &num of us there , in total , out of which i think &num were non christians . 
^ really exciting to be able to study the person of &name together and explore him together . 
^ i 'm very thankful to &name for these &num people who came along . 
^ what was very interesting , and a little surprising , was that virtually all of these contacts came on their own . 
^ in my experience of putting on evangelistic events and courses , that almost never happens ! 
^ how exciting it is to see that people are so keen to look closer at &name &name that they do n't need someone to bring them along . 
^ but for us , as leaders , it is tempting to think " &name ! 
^ they 've come along by themselves , so i 've now got a table full of people to talk to . " i want to urge us all not to think like that , but rather be saying , " &name &name for bringing these people along , on their own , but where are all the other people who said they wanted to come ? " 
^ last week we were all so encouraged as we heard of more and more people signing up to do explore -- &num by the end of the fortnight . 
^ now in previous missions , we would probably have been hearing of people making professions of faith , but with people so far back , it seems more thinking is required . 
^ but how exciting that &num people have said to us : " i want to do explore . 
^ here 's my email address , and college . 
^ get in touch with me , and help me to look closer at &name . " 
^ what i 'm really saying is the mission starts here . 
^ we 're tempted to drop our heads , rightly get back to the books , and hope life gets back to normal , with our seats in their upright positions . 
^ &num people signed up for it , most of them only knowing there was a wed / &name night running . 
^ assuming there 's a drop off of say , &num , that leaves &num contacts , who could make wed / &name . 
^ i.e. an average of over &num per night . 
^ yet at week &num of explore last night , the first meeting after the mission only &num came along . 
^ and &num of those brought themselves along . 
^ the greatest priority &name should have right now , and for the next &num weeks is these &num people . 
^ &num people who 've offered time to look into &name &name . 
^ &num people who want to be followed up . 
^ so what i 'm asking , is whether we can all , as a team of explore leaders , follow-up as many of these people as we can , as soon as we can . 
^ they need personal invitations to explore ; someone to , say , agree to meet them at 7pm and head over together . 
^ the bringers could be us ( in which case , you 'd be exempt for getting there early that week ) , or the keen evangelists in college . 
^ the absolute priority has to be personally inviting these &num people along to explore . 
^ it will probably mean door knocking , but these folks have already volunteered their information , and want to be followed up . 
^ i do see this as a stewardship issue , to which we will be accountable to &name . 
^ we will have to answer for how we helped those wanting to find out about his &name , their only way of salvation . 
^ in closing , this teaches us a number of things : 
^ &num &name - thanking &name for the &num that came , and praying that these &num would be followed up well . 
^ if people do n't come to explore , then they may well have not come to the mission talks , all other things being equal . 
^ col &num : &num . 
^ &name did n't just want bums on seats in his mission talks , but he wanted to present everyone " complete and mature in &name " . 
^ &num &name - i 've got the list of contacts in colleges who need inviting . 
^ i will be in &name from 2pm , and would love to see whoever can outside &name &name , at 2pm , so that we can then go ahead and invite these interested people along . 
^ i 've attached the list , so that you can look down at those contacts in your college . 
^ they would be the natural people to followup first . 
^ regarding confidentiality , do n't leave the lists lying around . 
^ we are not going to publish names in &name , on college notice boards , or on the web . 
^ i think we sometimes hide behind " confidentiality " instead of taking risks for &name , but actually talking to interested people . 
^ &num recruit - try to find the keen evangelists in college to help in this . 
^ if we believe the gospel , then the most important thing we do this weekend will be to personally invite these contacts along to explore . 
^ and , as leaders , we have to set the pace . 
^ noone will bother if we do n't. 
^ thanks guys for reading . 
^ i know we 're tired , but there 's lots to be excited about , and still lots to do ! 
^ &name there are n't more older christians around to help . 
^ praying for you , 
^ &name 
^ &name remember explore motto : the mission starts here !
