^ that 's fantastic . 
^ thanks , &name ! 
^ it has occurred to me that some undergraduates might have left by the friday , as it is technically after the end of term . 
^ do you get chucked out immediately or will you be able to stay till then ? 
^ ( i know &name people have to leave by friday morning - i think that 's ridiculous myself ... ) 
^ see you tonight ?

^ ok , i have booked the fellows garden for friday the 20th of june , between 5pm and 8pm . 
^ i did n't know how many people are gonna go so i gave a rough estinate of &num people . 
^ the booking needs to be approved by the council ( which apparently is not gonna be a problem ) 
^ there is a refundable charge of &pound; &num ( assuming the garden is left in the same state as it was before ) and a non-refundable charge of &pound; &num for the rubbish &name . 
^ regards .

^ hi &name , 
^ the go soc is planning to hold a garden party in the early evening of friday 20th june ( end of may week ) . 
^ we are struggling to find an appropriate venue . 
^ &name &name 's college has a bookable fellow 's garden . 
^ could you possibly try and book for that date , preferably between &num and &name or something similar . 
^ we need to get a venue sorted as soon as possible , because otherwise they will all be booked up . 
^ it 's possible they wo n't allow university societies to book the gardens . 
^ if that is the case , please let me know . 
^ if you ca n't get friday evening , see if it is available for thursday 19th evening or saturday 21st afternoon . 
^ get back to me asap . 
^ thanks , &name xx 
^ ps . 
^ my number is &num &num , if you have any queries .
