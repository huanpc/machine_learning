^ hi &name , hope you can get this . 
^ but being a computer whiz i 'm sure you can . 
^ how did your brothers do in their exams . 
^ &name got an &char and &num &name so she 's going to &name as planned . 
^ &name got &num &num / &num &char * , &num and a &char , which annoys him because he did n't quite manage to beat me . 
^ &num question that i 'm not sure of the answer to at the moment is how " good " should you be before entering a relationship . 
^ after all , we will never be perfect . 
^ on the other hand , i feel like one should try to be as sorted as possible , not bringing too many problems to the relationship . 
^ for example , my leadership is not particularly good , and i was really challenged by reading in &name 's gospel about &name " servanthood with leading . 
^ though there is probably no absolute answer , if i could find a basis for reaching a decision on this &name be able to make a better judgement of how to move forward . 
^ i 'm going to visit &name this monday- we 'll probably go sailing with some friends of hers- and hopefully we will have good fun . 
^ sorry for being rather serious &name &name &name
