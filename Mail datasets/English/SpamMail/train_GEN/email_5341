^ the files needed for working with the named entities ( ne ) are now available in qa03 / xmlrmrs directory . 
^ the readme.html file has been updated to explain what the nes are and how to access them in your code . 
^ in brief , the named entities are kept in a corresponding &name file , which is a plain text version of each answer sentence ( &num per line ) with tags marking the nes . 
^ the &name class has been enhanced to support these files inserting the ne sentence as one more node in the &name . 
^ note that you will need to increase the buffer size ( specified in the constructor ) to accommodate the ne sentence . 
^ suggested size is &num . 
^ &website and i will be adding the rest in the next few days . 
^ if you have any problems please let me know sooner rather than later . 
^ &name
