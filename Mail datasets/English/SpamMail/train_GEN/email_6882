^ hi &name and &name 
^ i hope that this e-mail finds you well . 
^ would you guys be willing to help out doing the coffee and tea trolley after the &num : &num service ? 
^ the tea and coffee trolley is important as it reduces over crowding at the back of the church and allows everyone a chance to get tea and coffee . 
^ if you are able or unable to help , could you let me know by reply please ?
