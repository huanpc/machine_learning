^ so let me explain the situation with my aunt . 
^ &name is tomorrow ... i was told to head down there in the afternoon to get there before sundown . 
^ i 'm not sure which aunt 's house the ceder will be at ( my regular aunt or a different aunt who is slightly more distantly related ) . 
^ so the problem is that i do n't know if i know them well enough ( especially if the ceder is at this other aunt 's house who i have n't seen for years ) to show up with a friend at the last minute . 
^ of course , jewish religion says that you should keep your door open on &name in case anybody ( assumedly poor ) wants to stop in. for this reason , they obviously could n't turn us away : &name and when you add the middle eastern culture on top of that , no way can they say no. however , the culture is also for guests to never ask for anything ... 
^ so to make things even more complicated , my aunt thinks that she is the ultimate matchmaker , and has decided that my parents have failed in finding me a woman ... so she has taken it upon herself to do so . 
^ so apparently ( without my knowing ) she has invited a " nice jewish girl " to the ceder thinking that she is acting on my interests : ) . 
^ even my grandmother was telling me on the phone about her plans ! 
^ despite the fact that she only just told me , and that she does understand how the world works , i fear that she might be insulted if i bring a different nice jewish girl to ceder ... and when i get &num glasses of wine in me i do n't trust myself to be able to keep my hands off you : ) . 
^ talk about a scandal ! 
^ but despite all this , my loyalties to you outweigh my fear of causing a family scandal , and if you do n't want to go to &name , it 's more important that you have a place to go than me to worry about insulting my family . 
^ so please let me know your plans &smiley 
^ sorry about all this complication &smiley &name

^ hmmmm . 
^ well im not incredibly keen on going to &name , although it would be funny and i did want to see the place . 
^ &char may go for &num of the nights ... ? 
^ i do n't know yet . 
^ i 'm feeling like not travelling for a couple days . 
^ would it be awkward if &char came to your aunts house ? 
^ i would n't want to go if you would feel weird , you know ? 
^ but otherwise i think i would . 
^ hmm .. so &name . 
^ give me a call today and we can discuss . 
^ &char need to get back this &name family either way . 
^ oh and &name did not get a comp ticket . 
^ i did n't even know if he was at the show or not until afterwards . 
^ we sold less tickets then there were people so this means that lots of comp . 
^ tickets were used . 
^ ( hopefully press but who knows . ) either way , &name struck even . 
^ this is good but means no under the table money for &name . 
^ : ( even &num &name would have been nice so i could feel the rush of law breaking . ... : &char oh well . 
^ . 
^ i guess next time &char perform in eastern &name .. heehee . 
^ &name
