^ hey &name 
^ i jsut wrote organic chemistry &num and i think tht it went fairly well . 
^ there was &num mechanism that i know i messed up on because even though it is possible to obtain the desired product using the pathway i described , that pathway produces lots of otehr things as well , jsut because of the stereochemistry involved with the reactants and reagents i used . 
^ oh well ... 
^ so have you figured out what 's going on with your degree ? 
^ &name i heard , you couldnt " do that really cool soundign phd project becasue of gov' &char cutbacks ... do you guys have conservatives over there too ? ? 
^ &name is finally gettign rid of its conservative governement -- the only problem is that the reason they have been in power so long is that there is n't anyone else who can do the job . 
^ i do n't know if it 's worse for the gov' &char to screw up the province intentionally or for it to screw things up by accident . 
^ so who 's goign to take their place ? 
^ maybe the local chapter of the marijuana party ( i am not kidding , there is actually a political party around here -- probably founded by lakehead univeristy outdoor rec students -- whose only agenda is the legalization of mj ) . 
^ i think that the only poeple who are capable of runnign the country are the &num who are too smart to get into politics ... unless there 's great need . 
^ take &name &name . 
^ he could have been &name 's frist black president and get into history just bewcause of that , but he did n't want to be in that position . 
^ so now he 's the secretary of state and making sure that &name doens n't get carried away with antyhing . 
^ all i can say is taht it 's a good thing that " he 's in a position of great influenece in the states right now . 
^ so i 'm going home in &num days . 
^ i 'm really looking forwarrd to it . 
^ i 'm at &char of &char with a lab position for the summer , and i 'm gping to be training really hard -- with , of course , a good balance of screwing around with my friends . 
^ i 'll be up at one of my roommates " places in &name bay on the may &num weekend for a camping trip to an island that he and his friends have been goign on for the last few years . 
^ it 's called camp gitch becasue they hoist a pair of underwear on a flag pole and moon boaters who go by ... yes , i know , very mature , but when they did it to a police boat , the cops jsut laughed and waved ( &name knows most of the &name bay police force and will likely be a membert of it someday , so ... ) . 
^ so i 'm looking forward to that . 
^ has your girlfriend come down to visit your family yet ? 
^ she msut have been pretty nervous to meet the boyfriend 's family for the first time . 
^ how far from your place does she live ? 
^ what do you guys do about seeing each other in the summer ? 
^ well , i 'd better get packing now ... my english toffee cappucino is all gone ( &name &name 's is the best ! ) and i have to get all my stuff packed up this afternoon becasue i 'm goign to a friend 's place tonight and might be going on a road trip tomorrow , and then i 'm leavign wednesday mornign ! 
^ lots to do ! 
^ i hope all is well with you . 
^ take care , &name
