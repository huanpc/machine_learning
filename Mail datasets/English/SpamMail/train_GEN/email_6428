^ hello &name ! 
^ happy september ( or october if you do n't get this till then ... ) &name term is nearly upon us ... did n't it come quick ! 
^ i 've just come back from and inspiring few weeks spent with christians in &name and many a tale to tell ! 
^ this below might be looking like a bit of a long email from me but worry not , its not one of those act on immediately emails ! 
^ i wanted to provide a bit of help and support for you as you do slots in your college group meetings in the coming term ... so i 've formulated a bit of a plan . ... here 's some ideas ... 
^ it would be good to be thinking how to make international slots in our meetings next term nice and freshers friendly ... you will probably remember being bombarded with vast information overload as freshers , so its best to introduce things bit by bit . ... here 's an idea for what to do which you could use or adapt ... do let me know if this is useful or not useful &name i could do something similar in the future ... 
^ week &num : outreach to international students ... explain who you are , and what your role in the college group is as an intrep . 
^ explain why there should be a particular effort to reach out to international students . 
^ encourage freshers to be getting to know international students in their year , especially looking out to help those who are lonely . 
^ &name hint ... first &num paragraphs in the &name guide explain all this . 
^ could also tell them briefly about &name and say that more will be revealed next week . 
^ advertise the first intbrek of term . 
^ all this should take about &num seconds to say , leaving lots of time for . . ... prayer ! 
^ pray for international students in your college , especially for freshers settling in. pray that many friendships would be formed and that &name would be working through these to bring to himself people from all nations in &name . 
^ week &num : &name ... explain what &name is . 
^ encourage people to be thinking of who they could invite , think about how you might invite someone to &name . 
^ prayer ! 
^ pray for &name and people you could be inviting along ... some prayer points will also have headed your way by this time ) 
^ week &num : supporting worldwide evangelism ... explain why we seek " to be involved in &name 's work worldwide through his church " ( hint - check out third paragraph in the &name guide ) . 
^ also explain why intbreks and &name are a great opportunity to be hearing more and praying , and advertise the second intbrek of term . 
^ prayer ! 
^ there may not be time after the above to introduce another part of the world to pray for , so you could pray for &name 's help in keeping a broad vision for his work whilst we are tucked away in &name , and for the &name and &name 
^ week &num : international students in college . ... continue praying for the stuff you were praying for in week &num , and now also for new friendships that have been made . 
^ pray for anyone in college who has been going along to &name and for anyone else who you might want to invite 
^ week &num : &name ... explain what &name is ( check out &name guide and termcard ) . 
^ prayer - for &name and also for &name ... prayer points will have reached you . 
^ week &num : praying for &name 's work worldwide ... pray for the spread of the gospel elsewhere in the world ... if your college group has a certain place they always pray for then introduce that , otherwise operation world or &name leaders ( details from &name &name ) or the weekly &name prayer diary are all good resources . 
^ why not pray for the cu in &name ? 
^ if you have been to the intbrek in week &num then you will have fodder for this ! 
^ phew ! 
^ i think thats far enough into the dim and distant future ! 
^ hope that is not all too restrictive , hopefully it should help in providing a framework for an overall strategy for the term , we 'll run by that kind of framework as we discuss stuff during the term in link meetings , and i 'll make sure prayer points and any other info reach you in that kind of order ... so if i 've suggested you pray for something one week , then you will have prayer points for it ( and if you do n't you can give me a good telling off ! ) there 's &num weeks there , &num week will be taken up by the evang training roadshow so that leaves a 7th for you to fill in. 
^ and a few closing things to say from me ... * if you 've lost your &name guide let me know and a brand new one will be winging its way to your pigeon hole * hope plans for freshers are going ok ... please do keep in touch about anything and everything ... its great hearing from you ! 
^ looking forward to seeing y' all soon , love from &name xxx
