^ dear &name 
^ here is a ( small ! ) biography ... if there 's more room then there 's plenty more that i could provide , but i hope this suffices otherwise . 
^ i 've just got some photos done , and they 're terrible , so i 've found a slightly less terrible older one . 
^ still very bad though , and if you think i should try again , then let me know . 
^ i 'll append the biog below to save you typing it in again ( below the sig lines - hope that 's ok ) ; i 'll drop the photo into &name " pigeon hole in &name in the next few minutes . 
^ i 've lost the italics when pasting , so i 've enclosed the text that needs to be italicised by underscores - hope this is clear . 
^ &num more thing ; the new &name ensemble has a web page , at 
^ &website
^ which i usually draw attention to in the programme . 
^ i can think of a lot of reasons why you might not want to do this , but if by any chance you could find a line for it somewhere , that would be quite fun . 
^ i do n't have a very wide readership ! 
^ thanks
