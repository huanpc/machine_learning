^ hi &name , 
^ i am really sorry it took me so long to get back to you . 
^ things are really crazy here at &name ( more later in this email ) . 
^ also , it is best to use &email to email me - i do n't have my cs account forwarding to my &name account because it gets much more junk email that real email . 
^ i looked through my documents and i could n't find any of my &name stuff from last year - i am not sure where it went ( it might be on the laptop in my old office in &name ) . 
^ sorry i could n't be of help - i hope you found the documents from somebody else . 
^ glad to hear you are still taing - i am sure &name is really happy to have you helping him out . 
^ how is it ? 
^ is the class running smoothly ? 
^ how are your classes ? 
^ you asked for an update on how life isn &name is . 
^ in short , i am having tons of fun . 
^ i spent the first week in &name with my family ( my aunt , uncle , and &num cousins ) which was nice because i was able to adjust to being in &name before living on my own at &name . 
^ it was especially nice because i had n't seen my cousins for more than &num years , even though we used to be very close when i lived in &name . 
^ after this week in &name , i left for &name . 
^ like many visitors i 'm sure , i was initially struck by the ancient architecture - chapels , quadrangles , and dormatories that look kind of like the &name castle except that they actually belong , and fit in with their surroundings . 
^ but then i got to &name college ( where i am staying ) which is about a &num minute walk from the center of town , and the architecture suddenly became more modern . 
^ luckily i was warned about this or i might have been a little disappointed . 
^ my room is really nice - it 's about twice the size of a typical &name single room that already came furnished with tables , chairs , lights , and even a sink . 
^ there is also a " bedder " that comes every weekday and empties my trash and will do some minor additional cleaning as well . 
^ my first week here was crazy . 
^ there were no classes which was really nice because that allowed me to take care of all the little things ( such as buying all of the things i did n't have room to bring or could n't bring because the voltage in &name is different from that in the &name , finding a bank , figuring out what phone to get , etc. ) during the day , leaving the nights for socializing and enjoying the english lifestyle . 
^ most of the undergrads had n't moved in yet , so most of the people i met that first week were graduate students . 
^ the graduate population at &name is very different from the undergrad poulation - while the undergrads are mostly english , the graduate students are from all over ( so far i have met people from &name , &name , &name &name , &name , &name , the &name , &name , &name , &name , &name , &name , &name , and of course &name , &name , and &name ) , but most of the graduate students are from the &name . 
^ at times it felt like i was at an american university that had been somehow transported to 18th century &name . 
^ most nights are spent here at pubs in the center of town . 
^ &name has the highest density of pubs in the &name , so there is no shortage of new pubs to find . 
^ i much prefer the concept of an english pub to an american bar - perhaps it is my sedentary disposition but i enjoy being able to sit down and talk with people ( without having to yell ) which is usually quite difficult at most american bars . 
^ i have found it much easier to get to know someone that i have just met at a pub than i could at bars or clubs in the states . 
^ of course , as a natural consequence of frequenting so many pubs , i have been drinking much more than i am generally used to . 
^ it is apparently socially unacceptable for men to ask for a half-pint at a pub , so i usually have a pint of guiness at each pub . 
^ this can add up over an evening , but luckily the walk is so long to get to and from the center of town that i can work off all of those calories . 
^ classes are good , but not really central to &name life . 
^ people seem to work much less hard here , at least compared to &name . 
^ at &name i spent most nights reviewing and studying , here i do n't really find that this is necessary . 
^ but i still feel i am learning a lot - i am just more productive during the day . 
^ my &name is very much in the american style - where there is a lot of interaction between lecturers and students . 
^ speech processing and natural language parsing is interesting , but as you kow i was never really excited about it when prof. &name taught it in &name and i am still looking forward to next year when i can go back to databases . 
^ anyway , it is getting late and i should probably go to bed . 
^ i hope all is well , and if you find yourself in &name , you have a place to stay &smiley &name

^ hi &name , 
^ how is the &name ? 
^ i 'd been meaning to write and see how things were there , but now i have another reason for writing also : i 'm taing again for &num ( with &name this time ) and we decided to reuse the &name from last year which involved making a priority queue . 
^ i thought you were the head for this last year and might have a solution lying around somewhere . 
^ if you do and could send it to me when you get a chance that 'd be great . 
^ so , how is grad school ? 
^ being in the master 's program is n't much different than being an undergrad , except i have more work . 
^ classes are no harder , but i need to &name and grade for &num to feed myself . 
^ oh well . 
^ i 'm still hoping to get into a ph. &name program for next year . 
^ do you know yet where you 'll be ? 
^ &name 's class is good , as expected . 
^ it seems a bit slow perhaps since a lot of the systems stuff i 've picked up from &name 's classes , but it does seem useful . 
^ what kind of stuff are you learning ? 
^ well , duty calls . 
^ &name all is well with you . 
^ cheers , 
^ &name
