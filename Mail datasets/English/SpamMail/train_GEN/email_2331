^ [ reference to expensive organic chicken usually smaller and therefore more difficult to find . ^ very popular with the revered flat people . ] ^ till we next meet then , [  ame anticipation of friendship , the author reveals his deep-felt need for companionship . ^ linked with the frailty of human emotion syndrome as studied by  ame of the  ame  ame medical research labs . ] ^  ame ,  ame ,  ame and  ame  ame , [ here each of the author 's flat mates is personified as a well-known clock  um )  ame . ^ an anagram of the v.g.a. clock ( virtual germ-free apartment ) . ^ thought to pertain to the author 's ideal state of being for the coming year . ^  um )  ame the  ame  ame is often found in anthills . ^ its source of power is unknown , but it appears to work reasonably accurately . ^ it comes with a built- in television . ^  um )  ame . ^ there is no such clock , thereby giving great support to the popular view that the original spelling was n2o . ^ this would then correlate with the well known laughing clocks of eastern  ame . ^ ( n2o is the chemical symbol for nitrous oxide more commonly known as laughing gas . )  um )  ame . ^ likened to  ame  ame in  ame , this shows the authors feelings regarding the permanency of  ame , his unwavering tick-tock some authorities use this reference to introduce the deity of  ame , but we refute that , giving  ame the credit . ] ^ i wish you the best of the prize . ^ [ curiously , here the author appears to be wishing for his friends to enjoy his presence while he is absent . ^ this seemingly contradictory statement actually makes perfect sense if the reader interprets the merit of the author 's presence inversely from that which is portrayed . ^ however , scholars struggle over this version as it is generally thought his lordship was very well liked by his colleagues . ^ a dilemma for the modern mind to puzzle over if ever there was one . ^ the venerable  ame  ame put it down to grammatical errors , but this proved highly unpopular with the  ame ( pro  ame  ame ) groups of his day , leading to his untimely martyrdom . ] ^ what prize is this ? ^ i hear you say , [ figurative language appertaining to the gift of friendship . ^ fundamentalist followers of his lordship often claim that he could actually hear his friends questioning remarks over hundreds of miles . ^ this cannot be refuted strongly enough as current opinion states that his lordship was definitely not divine . ^ some may argue that early engravings of the renowned flat person glow with a radiance of their own , but we attribute this to their being discovered in close proximity to radioactive surroundings  ame  ame 's  ame ] ^ of which his lordship speaks today [ allusion to the means of communication employed by the author to deliver his poem . ^ many beautiful words have been written on this proverbial verse of verses , highlighting the individuality of text . ^ the appearance of living words are starkly contrasted by the citation of the author 's pseudo-title his lordship , denoting grim and lofty determination . ^ however , the non-inclusion of capital letters in the name suggests a glimmer of recognition that mortality may have reached the author . ^ death comes to all . ] ^ why , tis living with me , of course ! ^ [ false egoism , of which the author is prone . ^ also can be interpreted that the gift of friendship is living inside the author , or , for that matter , any gift . ^ could this possibly be another hidden allusion to the author 's brevity of existence ? ^ the venerable  ame  ame was of that opinion . ] ^ (  ame  ame ,  ame ! ) [ probably the author 's original comments . ^ these words have become timelessly enshrined as the pro  ame  ame benediction . ^  ame squawk loudly while chanting in solemn canadian monotones  ame  ame ,  ame many times over . ^ this practice is outlawed in  um states due to the subtle machinations of the venerable  ame  ame  ame group . ^ these worthy individuals have taken it upon themselves to ensure the welcome poem is passed down through the generations in all purity and with the highest appreciation of purpose . ] </text_normal></message_body></message>
