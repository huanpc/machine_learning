^ well hon , that 's a good question &smiley 
^ i guess you 'll be coming to &name 's &name ? ? 
^ from there take the &name line to &name . 
^ then get an overland train to &name &name . 
^ there are &num exits - take the &num marked shopping &name . 
^ you can either walk from here ( a good &num minute walk ) or take the bus . 
^ if taking the bus turn left out of the station , cross the road at the pedestrian crossing onto &name &name 's road . 
^ the first bus stop on your left will take you to &name road . 
^ get off at the first stop . 
^ ask the bus driver . 
^ if walking , turn right out of station . 
^ walk up the hill over the bridge . 
^ at the traffic lights , turn left and then immediately right down a residential street called straithwaite or something similar . 
^ it bends round to the left and you will come to another pedestrian crossing . 
^ &name the road and walk down &name park . 
^ now just keep walking straight for about &num minutes . 
^ the road will become &name road and then &name road . 
^ any problems call me ! 
^ the walk is very easy .
