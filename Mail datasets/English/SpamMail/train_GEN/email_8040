^ pub crawls are possibly the most stupid invention ever . 
^ but it was actually a really good night . 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name i always hate the beginning of pub crawls . 
^ there 's the anticipation of the morning that will follow , i think ... 
</text_normal>

^ hmmm. .. it probably depends what the talk 's on and how much work i 've got done by that point of the week . 
^ i have one ... * just &num * ... stupid speech processing , &char pish pish practical left to do and if i 've managed to get that done in today or tomorrow 's lab , then i 'll almost definitely come just to celebrate . 
^ oh , are you going to formal hall though ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i think i 'll try to . 
^ i 'm trying to be a bit more social and bit less avoidy of all things &name . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ hmmm. .do you never call yourself wez ? 
^ has that just come from other people or what ? 
^ and does the fact that you call yourself &name mean you do n't like being called &name ? 
^ &name i can easily stop . 
^ i have a habit of refusing to call people by nicknames . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name was what i used to always use . 
^ i was n't keen on &name .
