^ there are &num copies of that book in the library . 
^ &num i can account for . 
^ both are due back today . 
^ no student to my knowledge has asked me to reserve a copy . 
^ these books of course can be renewed if no one else requests them . 
^ as to a reference copy , i 'm afraid that is not possible under the present circumstances . 
^ where would i keep it ? 
^ there is supposedly a reference section in the library , but those books go out of the library when i am not here . 
^ if i kept a reference copy locked in my office space , then no one could use it if i were not here . 
^ i am happy to order another copy if you think there is a need . 
^ &name
