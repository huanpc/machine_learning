"  um am confident in the  ame that you will take no other view . ^ the one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty , whoever he may be . ^ 11brothers , if i am still preaching circumcision , why am i still being persecuted ? ^ in that case the offense of the cross has been abolished . ^ 12as for those agitators , i wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves ! ^ 13you , my brothers , were called to be free . ^ but do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature [  um ] ; rather , serve one another in love . ^  ame entire law is summed up in a single command : " love your neighbour as yourself .' [  um ]  ame you keep on biting and devouring each other , watch out or you will be destroyed by each other . ^ life by the  ame ^  ame i say , live by the  ame , and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature . ^ 17for the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the  ame , and the  ame what is contrary to the sinful nature . ^ they are in conflict with each other , so that you do not do what you want . ^ 18but if you are led by the  ame , you are not under law . ^ 19the acts of the sinful nature are obvious : sexual immorality , impurity and debauchery ; 20idolatry and witchcraft ; hatred , discord , jealousy , fits of rage , selfish ambition , dissensions , factions 21and envy ; drunkenness , orgies , and the like . ^ i warn you , as i did before , that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of  ame . ^ 22but the fruit of the  ame is love ,  ame ,  ame ,  ame , kindness , goodness , faithfulness , 23gentleness and self-control . ^ against such things there is no law . ^ 24those who belong to  ame  ame have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires . ^ 25since we live by the  ame , let us keep in step with the  ame . ^ 26let us not become conceited , provoking and envying each other . ^ footnotes ^ 5:  um or the flesh ; also in verses  um ,  um ,  um and  um ^ 5:  um  ame . ^  um :  um ^  ame the version is  ame , if you want to know . ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
