^ hey everyone , 
^ last match in league play is this saturday at &name . 
^ we are currently comfortably in front of every one else in the league ( though i 've figured out the contingencies and we need to win at least &num set to ensure that we stay top -- &name i could still tie us if they win their final &num matches &num and we lose &num ) . 
^ we 're playing &name &num ( second from the bottom ) so it should n't be difficult . 
^ assuming the regulars will be there . 
^ would be great to see new faces too . 
^ so take a break from revising and come out to &name 's piece at &name . 
^ best , &name
