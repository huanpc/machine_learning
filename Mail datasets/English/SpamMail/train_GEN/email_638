^ dear &name , 
^ " &name , well , i 'll start by apologising for the message i sent you - it was fairly nasty and i 'm sorry for the way in which i said things . 
^ but i wo n't apologise for the content , because it was true . " - thank you . 
^ i found it very hurtful and have n't been thinking of much else since . 
^ your email basically accused &name and &num of not caring about you or your feelings , suggested you did n't want to have anything more to do with us , and was dripping with sarcasm . 
^ &name . 
^ the point in having the meal was because the &name 's president 's &name was on wednesday . 
^ the invitation was open to anyone on the list , and you were n't the only one who could n't make it . 
^ had only &num or &num of us been able to go the meal would still have gone ahead . 
^ " &name , &name asked me some days ago whether i would be able to come to a meal on the wednesday . 
^ i told her about college group and said that i could n't, so you all knew that i would n't be able to , and to be included in any kind of invitation list was just patronising . " - it was not patronising . 
^ &name had cell group at &num : &num but she still came . 
^ when did your college group start ? 
^ since you would n't discuss trying to work around the issue we simply made the meal as early as we could ( to the discomfort of some others i might add ) in the hope that you would be able to attend . 
^ 'secondly , had i been arranging the meal , i would have made some kind of effort to re-arrange had one of you not been able to make it - to not even try is basically just saying that you 're not bothered whether i 'm there or not , which is not nice . " - as i have already mentioned , if people could n't make it then that 's a shame but the meal was on wednesday for a particular reason . 
^ as i have also mentioned , we did make " some kind of effort " to rearrange the meal as best we could within the framework of the reason for the meal . 
^ " thirdly , to say that you " do n't understand " what &name and i were trying to say reads like this : " &name ca n't come to the meal , but i do n't want to take responsibility for her being hurt , so i 'll pretend i do n't know what 's going on '' - perhaps you overestimate my intelligence . 
^ i received rather cryptic replies from both you and &name . 
^ neither of you stated your intentions clearly . 
^ for example , your reply to the first email was " enjoy " - very informative . 
^ " i ca n't help wondering whether , had it been say , &name or &name who could n't have gone , whether you and &name would have made more of an effort to reschedule . " - and i ca n't help saying that it would have made no difference to our " efforts to reschedule " whatsoever . 
^ you will only be able to come close to understanding our point of view when you realise that the meal was not primarily arranged for a social reason , but for a practical one . 
^ " i 'm sorry if this seems harsh , but i 'm just trying to be honest . 
^ i know you were upset by the email i sent you , but &name , if you do n't tell me , i ca n't even begin to respond . " - how do you know ? 
^ " i mean , the ball was firmly in your court , to be honest - and what is friendship without honesty ? 
^ if you have a problem with something i do or say , you have to tell me . " - it has nothing to do with honesty . 
^ the reason i did not respond to your email was because i generally prefer not to lose my temper if i can help it . 
^ i would have regretted it . 
^ i am regretting writing this now - but what choice do i have since you basically said reply or we wo n't be friends . 
^ " i wo n't have a one-sided friendship where i have to make every effort to see you , to apologise , to forgive first . 
^ if you wo n't make any effort with this , &name , there 's nothing i can do ; but i 'm not going to sit by and let your stubbornness spoil your friendships . " - &name . 
^ whenever i suggest we meet up to see each other i get the usual " i 'm so busy with work and seeing people and doing this and that . 
^ my life is just so busy , i 'll have to see if there 's a space in my diary " do you know what that says to me ? 
^ it says " i really do n't have time to see you . 
^ it 's a matter of priorities . " as i have explained , it is n't stubbornness on my part , it 's a different approach to possible conflicts . 
^ " either we are honest with each other , and we tell each other when the other has done something " wrong " , and i try and get over my pride and you your shyness , or we are n't friends ; because i hate unreal friendships . 
^ i want you to be honest with me , and i will be with you . " - it would seem you already have acknowledged that you knew i was hurt by your email , so i 'm sure you were aware i thought you had done something " wrong " . 
^ as i have explained before , it 's nothing to do with shyness . 
^ i 'm shy around people i do n't know - not with my friends . 
^ " if you do n't reply to this email , i 'll know that you do n't want to be friends with me . 
^ if you do , let me know when you 're free , and we can meet up and talk about this , or just reply by email ... but only if honesty is on the agenda . " - &name , the blackmail part sorry . 
^ i want to talk to you about this . 
^ i 'm free all the time . 
^ just come to my room and if i 'm not there text me and i 'll be there as soon as i can . 
^ " i think you 'll probably be really annoyed when you read this . " - no , i was very pleased . 
^ it made a change from the last email you sent me which must be good . 
^ i really like you and want to be friends . 
^ that 's why i was so upset by your email . 
^ love &name 
^ &name please do n't be too upset at all the horrible things i 've said to you in this email . 
^ you may call it honesty , but i feel awful about sending it to you .
