^ others may think that 's a really bad idea but it would be a way of ^ raising the appropriate amount of money . ^ but i leave that for others as i 'm sure they will have better ideas . ^ this is just off the top of my head and i 'm sure someone has said it before anyway ! </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ ^  um format of papers to be included in the proceedings </text_embedded><text_normal> ^ depends on how we publish them . ^ i agree with  ame 's /  ame 's point that libraries are much more likely to buy  ame copies , so we should go with that , but it seems fairly standard anyway ( with automatic scaling-down of documents submitted in  ame format ) . ^ people should definitely be limited as to how much space they can occupy but that , again , will depend on who publishes the stuff and how many pages each volume has ( assuming there are  um , which i think there should be ; there will have to be really ) . ^ but these are obvious points . ^ for more detailed points of how things should look on the page , we should use either ^ the copil style-guide or take our cue from any refereed journal that we agree upon . ^ i hope that these are useful and not obvious points . ^ i 'm afraid they do n't ^ add much but they 're my opinion for the time being ! ^ once again , sorry i ca n't be there tomorrow , but i look forward to hearing what happened . ^ all the best ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
