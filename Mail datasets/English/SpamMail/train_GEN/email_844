^ &name , 
^ " you are besotted with &name . 
^ you talk , eat , sleep and breathe &name . " 
^ - i most certainly am not ! 
^ i appreciate that &name has a valid contribution to make to society , nothing more . 
^ it may be true that i find his orange hair entrancing , but it is n't actually . 
^ no , &name is a " great guy " - his words , not mine . 
^ " i am doing some community work this weekend . 
^ i think i 'm playing parachute games and organising kids on a bouncy-castle . " 
^ - i hope you enjoy it and i hope they do to . 
^ i 'm off to camp next saturday . 
^ " i have almost finished by &name parser generator . 
^ i will send you a copy if you like . 
^ it 's revolutionary . " 
^ - congratulations ! 
^ yes , i 'd love to receive a copy , although i 've absolutely no idea what it does . 
^ you 'll have to explain . 
^ &name , eh ? 
^ i expect nothing less , at least in words . 
^ " please do n't send emails to my &name account . 
^ just send them to this one . " 
^ - thank you , i was thinking of asking you which address you wanted me to use ! 
^ well , i wrote &num sixth of my dissertation yesterday ! 
^ i have now completed the section on 'molecular wires " , and am about to move on to 'molecular switches " . 
^ eventually i 'll be writing about nanocomputers , the theory of which i find quite interesting , but for the moment i am explaining the building blocks . 
^ talking of building , this afternoon i have been putting the finishing touches to a stone circle i have been constructing for our garden . 
^ it has now begun to rain so i have retreated gracefully indoors and was pleasantly greeted by your e-mail . 
^ this evening i am going to have my hair cut , by that well-known hairdresser - my mother . 
^ i will probably be going down to &name next week , perhaps on thursday . 
^ i need to get some more papers from the library for my dissertation . 
^ it will also afford me the opportunity to do some shopping and absorb the general ambience . 
^ are you happy that you 've nearly finished your &name parser generator ? 
^ will you have much else to occupy yourself with ? 
^ let me tell you a little story . 
^ one of my lecturers told me that the &name its usernames were simply our &name codes transferred into base-32 . 
^ however , i was looking into this a few days ago ( no , i do n't have too much time on my hands ) and it did not seem to be an accurate explanation . 
^ my username certainly produced a number the same length as my &name code , but the digits were different . 
^ i am unable to solve this puzzle at present . 
^ sincerely , 
^ &name 
^ &name as you know , i use my &name address all the time . 
^ however , if you wanted to , you could sent emails additionally to my &email address . 
^ just a thought . 
^ please send them to my &name address though .
