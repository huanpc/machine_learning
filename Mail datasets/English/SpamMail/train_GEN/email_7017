^ just a reminder about the game on sunday &num may , after the student lunch : please come over for squash and to play the board game i brought to &name . 
^ i was thinking about how to say something creative and poetic so that people would remember and want to come , but i 'm in a bit of a daze now , and i did n't think of anything creative to say . 
^ so i 'll just say that i enjoyed spending &name weekend with you , and i 'd really like to see you on sunday . 
^ the directions are : 
^ get on &name &name ; take it northwest as it becomes bridge street , &name street , etc. 
^ about where it becomes &name road , there 's a &name garage . 
^ at the garage , turn right onto &name road . 
^ continue on &name road until you come to the &name road post office on your right . 
^ turn left onto garden walk . 
^ continue until you find a house with a brown door and a number &num nicely camouflaged brown by tarnish . 
^ i 'll have a sheet of paper up that says " &name 's game " . 
^ love , 
^ ++ &name &name , &email
