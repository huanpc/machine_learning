charset="iso-8859-1" </content-type><message_body><text_normal> ^ hi all ^ i 've just accidently deleted my really long email . ^  ame . ^ to summarise what i had written : ^ with my organising committee hat on , we just need policy decisions , prices and deadlines the week before the conference and an outline of formatting guidelines to go in the welcome pack for presenters . ^ we need to be able to answer people 's questions as we have already had a lot of queries about it and it is only fair to do so by the conference . ^ the outline of formatting guidelines only need be  um page to start with , to put in the packs , but with a web-based more detailed description soon to follow. . ^  ebsite dont " think we would need to go into a quarter as much detail ! ^ having said that , the word template is good and will save the team a lot of time in the long run . ^ the org . ^ committee thinks that paying on the day and having a manned proceedings stand is a good idea & also that to have an order form in the packs ( and more on the stand ) is a good idea . ^ packs are being prepared the week before and this will need to be ready by then . ^ my personal opinions : ^  ame vs  ame : i would prefer the same for each . ^ if papers are organised thematically or alpabetically it woudl look odd to have one at  um pages and the next one at  um pages , etc as  ame says . ^ also there are other reasons that i have mentioned before . ^ i agree that we can only estimate no. of volumes needed after the conference . ^ we need to check that the printer 's offer will stay open for a few weeks , and that they are prepared to do a smaller print run and what the cost per volume woudl be for a smaller run . ^ it would be good to get this now so that we can check that if we only order  um , we can still charge  ound;  um and still not make a loss . ^ please if  um has done this , give me the number and i will ring them . ^ we cannot afford to take a loss on this because there is  um to bail us out . ^ ( we are charging a set price , eg.  ound;  um , up front . ^ we will hope that more people will buy than pay on the day so there is some guesswork involved . ^ if we order  um , the cost will be  ound;  um each totalling  ound;  um . ^ if we sell  um we cover our costs . ^ but we wo n't know how many we want to order until the day so clearly if we only end up only ordering  um or so , then the cost per volume will be higher . ^ if the cost per volume becomes  ound;  um , fine , but if it becomes  ound;  um each , then we will be making a loss . ^ in which case , we might want to set the start price higher to begin with . ^ so we need to find this out . ) ^  ame ^  ame all . ^ in reply to  ame 's email , this is to express my opinion regarding the issues under discussion : ^ to begin with , regarding the poster policy , i am in favour of allocating the same number of pages to both oral and poster presentations in the proceedings volume . ^ as far as i know , the oral presentations are  um and posters  um , so firstly , the numbers are both high and secondly , i am of the opinion that it would be better to stick to the view that the difference in the type of presentation does not entail any other difference between papers . ^ accepting this last point leaves us -in my opinion- with no real strong argument for a possible distinction in the number of pages allocated . ^ giving the same number of pages to both oral and poster presentations , on the other hand , would mean the allocation of  um pages per article out of a total of  um pages ( this is the limit for the printers if i am correct ) . ^  ame presentations were initially thought to be assigned  um pages anyway , so it wo n't make such a difference , as opposed to the poster presentations " space which will be significantly more . ^ furthermore , by allocating the same number of pages to all presentations , practical problems will also be eliminated in the proceedings volume ( thematic instead of oral-poster sub-sections , keeping in pace with common practices , more people possibly willing to buy the volume -especially from the people presenting posters- etc. ) . ^ therefore , my proposal is that the number of pages allocated to all presentations should be the same and that we should wait until after the conference in order to see what are the exact numbers of people attended and of papers presented . ^ after that we can circulate an email to all participants having presented a paper , informing them about details like deadlines , the exact number of pages and the format / template of the article to be included in the proceedings . ^ regarding the printing offer , the number of volumes should logically depend on the conference participants and we will not be in the position of knowing exact numbers until after the conference has taken place . ^ so , i think that it would be better if we could wait a bit more before ordering number of volumes . ^ about the final price of the volume , i guess that a price around  ound;  um would be fine , taking into consideration that when participants sent their abstracts , they have agreed on a price of  ound;  um and that the inclusion of final printing and postage costs would keep the price under the  ound;  um that we will ask for . ^ finally , regarding the formatting of the papers to be submitted , i could work on the style guide and on the templates to be circulated to participants . ^  ame , please let me know if there is any problem with that , so that i can start working on it . ^  ame , i hope this helps . ^ enjoy your break and until we meet again ... ^ all the best ,  ame . ^ - -on  um april  um  um :  um  um "  ame  ame " (  mail ) wrote : </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ hi everybody . ^ i just got back from a meeting with the  ame organizing committee and it seems that we really need to speed things up , so i 'm asking for everybody 's co-operation . ^ first of all , we need to finalize some decisions , and specifically , our poster policy . ^ the organizing committee feels very strongly in favour of giving the same number of pages to both oral and poster presentations , mainly for the following reasons :  har ) it is standard practice in conferences  har ) the difference in the type of presentation does not entail any other difference between the papers and  har ) it will not be very presentable to have  um sections in the proceedings entitled "  ame " and " poster " , since we want to have thematic sub-sections . ^ since this is a decision to make , i ask you to send me your opinion by tomorrow  um /  um and i will circulate the result tomorrow night . ^ i think it is the best way to decide on that . ^ so , if you do have access to  ame , send me an e-mail with your views on that . ^ there are more issues at hand :  um . ^  ame offer : it might be a good idea to wait till after the conference to finalize the number of volumes we want to order . ^ it would be good if we could ask the printers if they can wait for a couple of weeks for our answer , and if the price (  ound;  miley will be the same in case the number of volumes drops to  um , for example . ^ any volunteers for that ? ^  um . ^ the price ( probably around  ound;  um ) will not include postage , so i 'm going to ask tomorrow at the post office for postage costs , since we need to put that in the order form . ^  um . ^ we need to write in a word-document an order form , which will be available at our desk on the day of the conference and will be included in the packs given at registration . ^ anyone willing to do this , please e-mail me . ^  um . ^ we also need to finalize formatting of the paper submitted . ^ anyone willinf to do this , please contact me , and we might also get a couple of templates from  ame . ^ this also needs to be done in a word-document . ^ as all this must be done by friday , i ask for your co-operation . ^ waiting for responses have a nice day  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
