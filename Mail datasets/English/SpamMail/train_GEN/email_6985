^ guys i 'll ask &name to use the prayer points you sent for &name - if you do have someone you can send to &name who can help out by introducing them that would be great , if not , no worries . 
^ it seems silly , in my opinion , to be running a prayer meeting at 4pm in &name when &name is at &name ... ca n't people come to that , and we pray with &name at some later point before &num ? 
^ &name will finish at &name , sorry for getting it wrong ! 
^ so , there are a couple of options : &num ) i can meet &name and bring him to &name for &num , him having eaten dinner earlier , and we can pray in a suitable room for a while and then show him around etc at or after 7.15pm . 
^ &num ) i can bring &name to the rehearsal at &num for him to find out what 's what etc. he can then come to &name and out for some food with me , before arriving at &name &name 's at around &num for &num mins or so of prayer before we start 
^ let me know your thoughts . 
^ i shall be contacting &name on wednesday afternoon hopefully , if we have a decision by then ! 
^ thanks for all your work , love &name . 
^ &name &name 
^ &name college &name &name &name 
^ room telephone : &num &num mobile telephone : &num &num e-mail : &email visit me : room &name , &name court

^ &num ) saturday : please let me know where and when you would like &name to be so that i can liaise with him and meet him and bring him to the right places at the right time ! 
^ if you could do this as soon as possible that would be great , as he wants to know .

^ i 'll get back to you on this- i 'd have thought that if 3.30ish is n't too early to ask him to arrive , it might be an idea for him to come to the chapel then at the end of the rehearsal , to see &name ? 
^ then if we 're having a prayer meeting from around &num , he might like to join us for that ? 
^ then there 'll be time for him to eat and get ready before it all begins . 
^ i 've emailed the tape secs to check that there 'll be enough time 
^ &num 15-7.30ish to sort out recording with him . 
^ &name may prefer to arrive a bit later , so these are only tentative suggestions- i 'll get back to you with something more definate ...

^ just realised &char forgot about &name / &name ! 
^ on a previous email you sent , &name , it says bt will be &num . 
^ is that correct?- &name does n't usually take &num 40mins ... i 'm just wondering when would be the best time for us all ( or as many as poss ) to get together and pray on the day ? 
^ &name will be in evensong at &name from &num ( to get a head start in setting up ) , and rehearsals go on till &num ... from &num after evensong , setting up and audience admission begin . 
^ any ideas ? 
^ &name &name be able to use the prayer points i 've sent you for &name ? 
^ it would be great if people could be praying for the evening then &smiley i 'll try to make sure that at least one of the admin team is there to fill everyone in on the latest . 
^ love &name
