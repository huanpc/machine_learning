<text_normal> 

^ i hear you . 
^ i always find that when i have to force myself to get up really early i have to fight this wave of depression that hits me when the alarm goes off - just an instinctive thing - do n't really know why . 
^ but i 'm getting up between &num and &num : &num anyway so it 's not a problem right now ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ anyway , that 's how my work is . ... i love teaching year &num and &num ... they are so sweet and &char love it when they understand something or when they 're really imaginative or really responsive to you ... anyway i 'm just turning into a sad old teacher !

^ i 'm really enjoying the actual teaching although i had no idea how complicated it was having to break concepts down into something that children can understand , especially when they are very different from you and learn in different ways . 
^ i 'm doing some extra work on how boys learn and also how to get them interested in english which is really interesting and useful because it is those kind of boys who work in a very different way from me . 
^ lectures are really interesting . 
^ they are very creative and i 'm really interested in everything we 're doing . . ... it definitely suits me ! 
^ we spent this week looking at creative ways of getting children to write poetry and we did some poetry too and i was really lost in it . ... the first time that 's happened to me for ages . 
^ i like teaching english better than drama and i 'm also enjoying the english languague part of it which is surprising . 
^ i think i might decide to just be an english teacher if i do decide to be a teacher . 
^ assignments coming out of my ears ! 
^ they are really really interesting but there are just too many and i have monday afternoons off and also tuesday afternoons sometimes but i really need to spend that time working and then have to do everything else as well as a bit more work at weekends . 
^ it 's probably good for me but definitely exhausting . 
^ anyway , that 's how my work is . ... i love teaching year &num and &num ... they are so sweet and &char love it when they understand something or when they 're really imaginative or really responsive to you ... anyway i 'm just turning intoa sad old teacher ! 
^ better get on with my marking ! 
^ seriously that 's what i 'm doing !

^ on the whole , yes . 
^ sometimes i get scared because i 'm not understanding some concept or other , but most of the time i 'm ok . 
^ i 'm really enjoying being part of college and playing football , going to bops , chatting to people etc. 
^ i 'm also really enjoying the practical work we have to do - it is so good to have a purpose again ! 
^ your work sounds a lot more demanding ( physically and emotionally , if not mentally ) than mine though ! 
^ how are you handling it ?
