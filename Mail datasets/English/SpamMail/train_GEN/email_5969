^ thanx sooo much for all your hard work , hope that your degrees are stilll ok . ... 
^ we will do another run sometime this weekend coming on the university , replacing torn / vanished posters . 
^ if anyone thinks that the amount of posters you had was way too little / much then give us a shout , and i will alter your numbers accordingly . 
^ if you dont say , you will get a bit less anyway , because i hope that some of them will still be up ! ! 
^ i will try and get you the posters by friday night 
^ cheers guys you are stars ...

^ dear brothers and sisters , 
^ i hope that &name is privileging you to work through you this witness week to be the means by which his glorious gospel is proclaimed . 
^ thank-you all ( in advance , for some ) for your organisation and hard work in helping with the &name publicity . 
^ it is tremendously encouraging that so many people are willing to serve the &name in this way . 
^ further to my previous e-mail : the posters will be delivered to the person whose name has a star by it on the rota by &name friday 31st january ( this friday . ) if you are that person ( check ! ) , please make sure you check your pigeon hole and collect the posters from the p' lodge . 
^ the town run will then happen on saturday 1st and sunday 2nd &name as explained on the rota . 
^ since you obviously cannot do the university run this week as orginally planned , please would you do this on monday 3rd to tuesday 4th &name . 
^ i realise that this gives you a lot of work to do in a few days , immediately after &name ( and will be praying that &name will show you how best to organise your time and make sure that you have the energy to do all your academic work and everything else as well . ) however , as tickets go on sale from monday 3rd , and as we do not plan to sell tickets on the door of the concert , it is essential that the publicity goes up as soon as possible . 
^ as i have not received any e-mails to the contrary from anyone , i assume that everyone is ok to do what they have been allocated to do on the rota and is in the process of coordinating with their groups . 
^ if there are any problems , please e-mail me &name . 
^ please remember to pray together and commit the run to the &name before you start , asking him to show you the places where he wants the posters / fliers to go . 
^ thank-you all so much , again . 
^ love in &name , &name &name
