^ hello everyone , 
^ only &num thing to say at the moment ... its one of those exciting weeks when we have an intbrek ! 
^ &name and &name &name who have been working in central &name have popped back to &name for a bit , and have managed to fit us into their busy schedule to come and speak at the intbrek on thursday ! 
^ it should be really interesting to hear what they have to say about how they seek to bring the gospel to people in an unreached area , and an inspiration to us as we seek to spread the gospel here in &name . 
^ do let the guys and gals in your college groups about this one ... good news , good food , and its not really that early ! 
^ they do n't know what they 're missing out on ! 
^ hopefully i should be sending some prayer points your way soon for &name if you want to be using that for your college group meetings tomorrow , 
^ bien bien , hasta luego hermanos !
