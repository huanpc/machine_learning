^ dear brothers and sisters , 
^ thank-you for all the work you have all so brilliantly already done for the &name in the publicising of the &name . 
^ please could you also do the following : &name / type a notice that fits on the space in the poster that says : " tickets available on the door " print it out the requisite no. of times and go around your university areas sticking this notice onto the poster , tomorrow if at all possible . 
^ also , we do need to pile on the pressure to sell tickets so do your best to persuade everyone you know to come , especially if you have any townie contacts . 
^ ( we trust in the &name to provide for the budget , however let as also combine our efforts in his strength . ) 
^ love in &name , &name
