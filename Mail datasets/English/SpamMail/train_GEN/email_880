^ &name , 
^ hello . 
^ firstly , thank you for sending the " lucre " e-mail . 
^ your classification of &name ( at least i assume it was he ) was rather amusing . 
^ it was really great to hear from you the other night . 
^ thanks for calling . 
^ &name suggested you all kidnap me from work - i like that idea very much ! 
^ yesterday morning i was working , but in the afternoon i went up to &name and bought a pair of shoes . 
^ i am now in the rather frivolous position of having &num pairs of shoes . 
^ last night i had a wonderfully luxurious hot bath , which i enjoyed immensely . 
^ this morning i have been at church and am now looking forward to a delicious stir-fry for lunch . 
^ i have decided that i am only going to write up another &num chemistry lectures before next term , after which i will relax / turn my attention to more interesting pursuits in the evenings . 
^ bye , and enjoy next weekend . 
^ &name
