^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your emails . 
^ i 'm having a good summer so far and am finally on holiday for a bit ! 
^ &name ! 
^ i 've spent the day playing the piano , &name , and replying to emails ... all very nice thigs to do , i think ! 
^ i 've been at &name for &num weeks and will be back again for another &num in september . 
^ it 's been good fun , though a bit weird as i really knew very little about plasma physics or programming before i started ... and still do n't, to be honest , but never mind . 
^ i went to a a lecture which was supposed to be an introduction to plasma physics ( there 's a plasma physics summer school for &name people going on at the &name , so i sneaked into the 1st lecture ! ) and all the " basic physics " that the lecturer started from before leaping off into plasma physics was stuff we 'd done only last term ! 
^ d' oh ! 
^ apart form the use of &name - i just about coped there ! 
^ no , it 's all very interesting . 
^ and the atmosphere is good in the department too . 
^ there 's lots of &name students from all over the world , and there 's very much an ethos that they 're researching interesting stuff for the common good ( ie to get nuclear fusion to work ) rather than to earn lots of money , so that 's quite cool really . 
^ did you get the link about &name survivor ? 
^ i 'm looking forward to it , it should be good , so do let me know if you want some more info . 
^ i 'm going with a load of people from &name church ( to distinguish it from &name church , you understand ! ) and you 'd be most welcome to join us ! 
^ the teaching in the seminars and main meetings is always excellent , and the worship is so honest and brilliant , you ca n't fail to learn something new about &name i reckon . 
^ my bro 's coming for the 1st time this year - so i hope he enjoys it ! 
^ &name , i 'd better be off i think . 
^ several people said they wanted to ge to the prom on 22nd july , so i think that might be a good one to aim for . 
^ ( &name violin conc among other things ... yay , i love that &num and have attempted to play it but with limited success ! ) . 
^ i 'll get in touch some time to sort out details if you 're still interested ? 
^ i 'm most jealous of your blue &name badge , btw ! 
^ are you working or anything ? 
^ i ca n't remember . 
^ hope you 're having a good summer , whatever . 
^ enjoy the sun while it 's still here ! 
^ &name 
^ &name thanks for the advice re webmail.hermes - i ghad n't discovered that before . 
^ i 've got outlook set up now so it should be ok . ... have n't tried to send any attachments since though ... 
^ &name if you feel like doing any extra prayer . ... i sent this to someone else so sorry if it 's not quite phrased as if written to you ! 
^ i just ca n't be bothered to type it all out again ... 
^ if you need more stuff to pray for . ... the youth work at my church needs it at the &name ! 
^ i know that compared to your church ours probably seems really vibrant etc etc ( that is n't supposed to sound nasty - but i know that you were worried about that side of things at your church ) but we 're having some difficulties at the &name . 
^ we have n't had a youth worker for a few years now , and it 's beginnning to show . 
^ in a way it 's good because the young people left in the church are all rally keen and completely stuck into &name , which is fantastic , but we 've lost a fair few on the way . 
^ anyway , there 's someone coming for interview tomorrow so we 're praying that finally this might be &name 's man . 
^ ( the lack of youth worker is certainly not from lack of looking for one , just lack of suitable applicants ! ) . 
^ anyway , we shall see . ... 
^ also a friend of mine is setting up a bible study group for student / just graduated / that kind of age people which i think is fantastic ! 
^ he 's going to be a &name relay worker in &name next year and wants some practice first , i think ! 
^ anyway , we have a core of about &num people who i think will support it really well , but we need to decide whether the focus is on encouraging christians during the holidays with solid bible study and good prayer ( which is what it 's been so far - although we 've only met &num times ) , or more outward-looking and something we can invite &name or fringe-type people along to . 
^ i mean , there 's a lot of people who came to sunday school that i still see around from time to time , and it would be fantastic to get them involved in the church again . 
^ anyway , any thoughts you may have would be appreciated !
