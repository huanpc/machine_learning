^ hi &name 
^ i 'm really sorry but could you see if you can find another willing volunteer for this - everything is rather crazy at the moment with work and rehearsals ( we have a cums concert this &char / &char too ) , and i 'm not sure i have enough time . 
^ i know that everyone else is really busy too and if you ca n't find anyone else then do get back to me and i 'll do my best . 
^ also , i 'm afraid &num can' &char make the prayer meeting again - as we have a cums rehearsal that afternoon . 
^ but am continuing to pray for the concert / organisation and have a few people who are interested in coming . 
^ must dash but will email later with prayer points thanks &name 
^ hi 
^ &name term is going well for you and that work is n't too heavy . 
^ after the concert we 're hoping to have a curry similar style to last year ( except i want all the &name musicians and admin team bar myself and &name to leave promptly with the other musicians to avoid segregation again ) . 
^ i was just wondering if you 'd to take on the role of arranging this . 
^ basically it would involve finding out who would be willing to cater for us and how much that would be , then getting numbers ( probably via &name at first rehearsals ) and booking the curry house . 
^ then on the night you 'd need to do any sorting out that needs doing then ( like collecting orders from stewards / &name who will arrive later &char . 
^ hungry ) and taking everyone to the curry house . 
^ would you like to do that , or would you rather not ? 
^ the choice is yours - feel free to say no if you do n't want to . 
^ take care - perhaps see you saturday ? 
^ many thanks , 
^ love &name
