^ hello again ! 
^ less party this time and some more " important " issues ... 
^ i am having a meeting with the domestic bursar next week , and i know some of you were very kind and filled in the questionnarie we send out . 
^ however , if you have any more complaints in regards to housing , showers , heating or whatever , then i would like you to email me before the end of the week ! 
^ you have to mention where you live , so that college know where the exact problems are . 
^ the college is being very perceptive about these issues , and will fix what they can ( sorry , they will not build a new house over summer ! ) but then i need to know what needs to be fixed , otherwise nothing will be done . 
^ so take a little study break and reply to this if you have anything you want to put forward . 
^ thank you 
^ &name &name &name president &name &name &name &name
