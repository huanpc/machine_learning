^ dear panel member , 
^ as a member of the volunteer panel at the cognition and brain sciences unit , i am requesting your help in a study examining emotional responses to short film clips . 
^ the study will require you to watch a series of &num short ( approximately &num minute ) film clips . 
^ after each film clip , you will be asked to rate your emotional response on paper , by circling the response that best describes how you feel . 
^ one of these film clips is slightly unpleasant , but has been tested in extensive pilot work here at the &name and no volunteer has reported it to be very upsetting . 
^ you will also be asked to complete some short but unrelated memory tests that will be presented on a computer . 
^ these will test your memory for either letters or spatial locations and will be unrelated to the content of the film clips . 
^ finally , you will be asked to complete a few questionnaires . 
^ the overall length of the testing appointment should be approximately &num hour and &num minutes . 
^ for those who are both interested and willing , i am looking for volunteers this week and next . 
^ please email me with your preferred day and time : 
^ wednesday 15th january : &num : 30am , &num : 00am , &num : &name , &num : &name , &num : 30pm 
^ monday 20th january : &num : 30am , &num : 00am , &num : &name , &num : &name , &num : &name wednesday 22nd january : &num : 30am , &num : 00am , &num : &name , &num : &name thursday 23rd january : &num : 30am , &num : 00am , &num : &name , &num : &name , &num : 30pm
