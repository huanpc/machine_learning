^ firstly , we have &name documentation now , up on the website . 
^ &name , i 've added &name system should allow function hyperlinks " to the red list , by which i mean being able to write : 
^ # blah blah blah see # funcname ( ) for details 
^ a bit like &name . 
^ how hard would this be to implement ? 
^ i also have a question to anybody who may read it : 
^ ok , so if a command fails in a package script ( either prep or install ) we have to cope with this somehow . 
^ at the moment , we plough on regardless which is n't too smart , for instance it means that if we fail a require ( ) check , we try and install anyway . 
^ &name . 
^ the way &name deals with this is to run scripts with set &char enabled , which makes the script terminate at the first line that fails . 
^ you can protect code like this : 
^ something | | true 
^ i 'm wondering if autopackage should do this . 
^ in fact i did it just now , but i 'm not &num sold that it 's a good idea . 
^ for starters , it affects the rest of the code invoked from the script . 
^ because our functions call things that might fail and test later with $ ? , that means we need to protect them by doing something like this : 
^ function foo ( ) { &name ; set &char ; . ... code . ... 
^ &name 
^ and in fact i 've written and documented these functions . 
^ but do we really want to protect every &name call that a script might make in this way ? 
^ thoughts ? 
^ thanks -mike
