^ what i suggest ( in an attempt to avoid that ) is for everyone to write down times they cant do ( should be easier than times we can do ) and we 'll try to pick a regular common time .

^ afraid that does n't leave much . 
^ i can do other times , but just not every week , so it would mean changing about a bit .
