^ thanks 
^ &name 
^ dear &name , 
^ i 'm a rep for &name 's international coffee bar ( which you should all know about ! ! ) . 
^ every week we invite people to come to a different college for formal hall after &name 's ( which incidentally in on a friday &num if anyone wants to come along ) . 
^ the problem we have this term is that we do n't have many team members that are from colleges which have weekly fhs on a friday . 
^ i 'd love it if you could help me out . 
^ if your college has a formal hall on a friday that you can buy tickets for , and your college is not too far away ( in walking distance ) , and you have no really posh dress code , then please get in touch . 
^ what i would ask you to do is to get your cu to buy tickets ( we usually want between &num ) and then come along and chat to the internationals . 
^ thanks so much for your help .
