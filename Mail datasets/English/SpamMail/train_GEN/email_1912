^  ame tells me you had an interesting trip to  ame ^ 'miss  ame has now left , and therein lies a story ; i was taking her to  ame to drop her off with her brother , and she assumed that it would be easy enough to find the place because she knew what it was called -  ame halls . ^ thus , she did not ask for directions , and upon arriving in  ame , she realised that it was somewhat bigger than she had expected and we would perhaps not be able to just " find " the place by knowing its name ! ^ and so ,  um people , a number of text messages and an hour later we eventually found our destination ! ^ anyway , she is there now and i am emailing you from my living room where  ame is currently residing . " ^ most amusing ! ^ i hope you are well and enjoying your 'resting " . ^ email me back . ^ i 'm going off to  ame  ame on thursday week , so i 'll send you a postcard . ^ best wishes , ^  ame ^  ame thanks for e-mailing - i was shocked , it 's not 1st april " till sunday ! ^ remember to eat lots ! ^  ame as you know ,  ame is unwell . ^ perhaps you would like to send her a get well card . ^ a few people are . ^  ame has sent an e-getwell . ^ i would be quite amusing . </text_normal></message_body></message>
