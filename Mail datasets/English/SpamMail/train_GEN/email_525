^ dear &name , 
^ thank you so much for your e-mail ; it was really lovely . 
^ " i have always said good-bye to you , have n't i ? 
^ sorry if i have n't ... i guess i am funny sometimes ( in a way that is n't amusing , i mean ) . " 
^ - yes , you are funny sometimes , and , as &name said to &name and i at the beginning of the flat year when we were getting annoyed with your " funny " behaviour - " guys , she 's good for you . " oh , but do n't feel bad ; as i think i may have mentioned before , i 'm really glad i shared a flat with you . 
^ we have all been moody at some time or another , and personally , your moods are slightly amusing ( though only slightly ! ) . 
^ " what were your issues with &name ? 
^ you do n't have to tell me ... sorry , just being nosy . " 
^ - of course i 'll tell you . 
^ do you really think i would have mentioned it at all if i did n't want to tell you ? 
^ i prefer to see you as being interested , not nosy . 
^ thank you for being interested . 
^ well , on friday evening after dinner , &name and i were looking at the flat accounts . 
^ i pointed out to him some entries , and he found some other entries . 
^ the entries were as follows ... 
^ ( &num ) the fact that the rope was bought out of the flat account , 
^ ( &num ) the meal you and i had at &name &name that night &name was cooking , 
^ ( &num ) the fact that we had bought " the &name " out of the flat account this term . 
^ &name was very cold towards me for the rest of the evening , and i was upset . 
^ suffice it to say that i did not enjoy the &name that night . 
^ at lunchtime on saturday i asked &name if he had been annoyed with me yesterday . 
^ he said he was annoyed , betrayed , hurt , etc. 
^ we had a long and painful discussion about the whole thing . 
^ i told &name i did n't realise he did n't want " the &name " to be bought out of the flat account and he seemed to find this difficult to believe , but accepted it , i think . 
^ the rope , i said was intended as a joke and i would be quite happy to pay back , since i had intended to mention it anyway . 
^ the meal , well , i think that upset &name the most . 
^ he said he felt that since he was very careful about his money , when i spent it like that he felt hurt . 
^ he said he did n't realise the flat account would be used like this otherwise he would have felt quite differently about it . 
^ i said that money was n't important and we had all spent other people 's money , i.e. reading week etc. the entire conversation was very very very slow and drawn out . 
^ we never once laughed or smiled . 
^ i apologised for all &num counts and asked &name what he would like me to do . 
^ he said he would appreciate me paying for the items , and said he would forgive me , as best he could . 
^ he then said that it might take him a while and that his manner towards me over the next while might well be coloured by it . 
^ what i felt , but did n't say , was that the entire thing was blown out of all proportion and that it was very petty . 
^ perhaps &name reacted in the way he did because he is muddled up after splitting with &name . 
^ i do n't know , but i was very surprised at his ability to seemingly hold a grudge , as i have always thought and been told that he did n't do that for any longer than a very short time . 
^ i now regret eating that meal , but only because it caused all this trouble . 
^ unfortunately i ca n't feel much remorse for the act itself , although i am trying . 
^ i do feel quite bad for upsetting &name and hurting him . 
^ oh , it 's horrible . 
^ thank you for listening . 
^ i 'm sorry for foisting this upon your eyes , and i hope you do n't mind too much . 
^ " it seems funny when you describe your behaviour as emotional ... but do n't worry , i know you are ! " 
^ - i think i find it very hard to show my emotions when with company . 
^ however , i certainly have them , as i have discovered this year . 
^ they make life very up and down . 
^ i wonder why i never used to be bothered by them ? 
^ i did not enjoy being the only person in either &name &char or &char last night , and i dreaded living on my own in the future . 
^ thankfully , i do n't feel as bad this morning though ! 
^ &name ! 
^ now perhaps i can write something less mournful . 
^ i 'm in the library this morning , about to start researching for my dissertation . 
^ yesterday i said good bye to &name and later &name . 
^ our phone was cut off , so i only have my mobile . 
^ we had our flat inspection yesterday morning , and the domestic manager said she had never seen such clean flooring in the kitchen ! 
^ however , se wanted me to have another go at the oven and clean the bathroom windows with glass cleaner ! 
^ she was very thorough ! 
^ she and the bursar were full of praise for our flat in general and said they should have had a competition for the cleanest flat . 
^ &name says ours would win . 
^ i have a feeling they might still have that competition ... 
^ anyway , it does n't sound as if you 're too busy , so i hope you 're enjoying yourself . 
^ you deserve it since you worked very hard this term . 
^ you may say you did n't and just spent your day idling in the library , but you certainly appeared to be working hard and that is quite a feat in itself . 
^ is your sister home yet , or are you alone with your parents ? 
^ in reference to the letter " covered with hearts and stuff " for my mother to find ... hmmm . 
^ obviously i 'd like a letter , although not covered with hearts and stuff , and if that was the case certainly not for my mother to find . 
^ thank you fr the tea towels etc. did you mean to leave your iron ? 
^ e-mail me soon ! 
^ ( and i shall not wallow in myself and &name 's issues any longer ! ) 
^ very best wishes , 
^ &name 
^ &name i object to the greeting at the top of your e-mail . 
^ i detest sugar puffs .
