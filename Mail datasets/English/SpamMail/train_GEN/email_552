^ dear &name , 
^ thanks very much for your e-mail . 
^ it was really good to chat to you last night , and sorry for being in rather a depressed mood at first - if you noticed . 
^ anyway , i am happier today and have just got home from work . 
^ why are you so bored ? 
^ are you looking forward to seeing &name ? 
^ i look forward to receiving your pictures of &name . 
^ do you still want to know about &name 's idea for a practical joke ? 
^ well , if you do then please do n't tell anyone , especially him . 
^ his parents recently bought a new remote control doorbell , which can be activated from up to &num meters away . 
^ such an item would produce much scope &name suggested both placing it in someone 's room at night , and also in a lecture theatre in someone 's bag . 
^ i prefer the lecture theatre idea , but it is much more risky . 
^ &name , it might be interesting if he did that . 
^ anyway , &name 's brother 's username file still has not been created . 
^ i realised i could connect to the &name undergraduate server and find out , but it is not there yet . 
^ we must wait 
^ hope you become less bored soon . 
^ say hi to &name for me if you remember , 
^ &name
