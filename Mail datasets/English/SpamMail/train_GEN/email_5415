^ love , &name my dear &name , congratulations on your results . 
^ they may not appear to be great , but the fact is - you can improve them later . 
^ the supervisors know this . 
^ how did the others fare . 
^ what is the best result . 
^ usually , the asians take some time to fall into place . 
^ the supervisors have experience because there were other asians under him , perhaps who were not as good as you . 
^ also , the fact is -at the third year you can pass many who are above you . 
^ only thing is you have to work hard and be dedicated . 
^ respect the supervisor and be obedient . 
^ &name 's supervisor was so fond of him , he used to buy shirts for him and frequently invite for dinners . 
^ project is easy as you have enough time to prepare it .

^ actually what matters in &name 's are the projects .
