^ hi &name 
^ sorry i did n't reply to your e-mail before - i have n't been particularly well . 
^ i hope your party went well and you had plenty of people come along . 
^ hopefully you managed to find some way to play your music last night , but if you want to do it again , the best thing is to either get some computer speakers and plug them directly into your laptop or to connect the speaker socket of your laptop to the video / mini-disk input of a modern hi-fi and drive it through that ( which should give you more than enough output ) . 
^ the best person to go to for help on this if you need it is &name &name who lives just below you . 
^ as a minor consideration , i see &name translated directly as gingerbread below . 
^ i guess this is a reasonable translation and is what the dictionaries give , but i do n't think &name quite fit 's into a british person 's idea of gingerbread . 
^ certainly we 'd not put gingerbread on the list of things that are going to be at a party in the same way as you 've done . 
^ i 'd personally just put &name in both , since anybody with any knowledge of german culture ( which is going to encompass almost everyone with an interest in the german society ) knows what &name is and will understand what you mean better ! 
^ just my &num cents . 
^ anyway , enjoy the last few days of term and take it easy .
