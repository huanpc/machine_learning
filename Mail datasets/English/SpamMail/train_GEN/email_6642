^ &name &name again ! 
^ thought i 'd try sending stuff in &num separate emails today to break it down into manageable bits for you ... and to make you feel popular with nice full inboxes ! 
^ please read carefully ! 
^ very important stuff ... 
^ first thing is when you 've got a new intrep who is going to take over from you please can you email me to tell me who that lovely person is ? 
^ let me know their email address too and then we can compile a nice big list ! 
^ your reps are probably sending this info to &name too but this is just to make sure we definitely get everyone . 
^ second thing is the most important ! 
^ if you have n't already please please tell your successor about &name training and tell them how great and useful its going to be . 
^ it is vital that people get along to that if they can , so next year 's lot can get off to the best start possible ! 
^ its going to be on wednesday 23rd april , and your reps should have the fliers about this which have all the details and reply slip . 
^ thats all methinks , give me a shout if i 've forgotten something ... or if you just want to say hello ! 
^ love &name xxxxx
