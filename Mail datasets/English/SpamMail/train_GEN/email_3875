^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for your email , sorry it has taken me a while to reply . 
^ as you will gather i am not great at hte communication thing either as i have n't written to you all term ! 
^ glad to hear you are well and stuff with &name is going well too . 
^ i am ok , still no job but it should n't be long now . 
^ i have joined a few agencies but they are so slow at getting back to you . 
^ but now i have started phoning them up and hassling them , so hopefully they will get so sick of me that they will get me a job just to shut me up ! 
^ i am quite enjoying not working though , lots of time to read and think . 
^ my latest thought is that i might do an ma next year , probably here at &name and live at home . 
^ i do n't know if their courses are full but it is worth a shot i think . 
^ its difficult as i want to get into political research but unless you have political party experience or research experience it is impossible . 
^ although i do n't know what &name will think about this idea . 
^ we are talking now and on reasonably friendly terms , something i thought impossible at the beginning of the year . 
^ i think that things are looking up in terms of reconciliation of some sort . 
^ however , there is no way that i am ready for anything like that yet . 
^ i have just made some big shifts in priorities , moved away etc and i ca n't just go back on all that yet . 
^ but it is not looking totally hopeless which is good . 
^ i am getting involved in a few things down here . 
^ i have joined the &name philharmonic choir and we had our concert last week in &name cathedral . 
^ we did a mass by &name and one by &name which was incredibly difficult but amazing . 
^ i am also hoping to join the &name symphony orchestra , although i have n't played my oboe for years so it may need a bit of work ! 
^ i have also got involved in a good church in &name which has been a help . 
^ i am quite enjoying living at home , which is something i never thought i would say ! 
^ it has its moments of frustration but on the whole it is good . 
^ and i have just been insured on mum 's car which is a great help as it gives me more freedom . 
^ &name is lovely and sunny at the moment and i even managed shorts and t-shirt the other day - bit of a contrast from &name ! 
^ have you heard anything about your phd plans yet ? 
^ i hope you have a lovely &name . 
^ lots of love , &name xx

^ hi &name , 
^ i just thought that i would write you a quick e-mail , to see how things are going with you . 
^ have you managed to get a job yet ? 
^ how are things between you and &name ? 
^ - i 've seen him around college a bit over the last term , and am a bit worried for him . 
^ i know it must seem that people worry about him more than you , but i guess that is because you appear more strong . 
^ i do n't really know how you are doing though , as i have n't talked to anyone , including you , for ages . 
^ i do hope you are ok . 
^ you were such a huge support to me in first year , i loved coming over to your house , and i do care about you now , still , even if i do n't show it much . 
^ this last term has been a lot of fun , and very hectic at the same time . 
^ things with &name are going well , altough i miss her quite a lot . 
^ not good . 
^ i do n't know what will happen between us , but i guess we are just trusting that &name has a plan , and that he will reveal it to us at the right time . 
^ &name now , i 'm enjoying it , and thanking &name for this gracious and very wonderful gift ! 
^ work is coming to an end now . 
^ i 've finished all my lectures and practicals , and so now , its just exams . 
^ i think i will start my exam preparations now . 
^ here i go . 
^ lots of love , and a big hug !
