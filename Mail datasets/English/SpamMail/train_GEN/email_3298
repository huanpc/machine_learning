^ at any rate , it was n't much of a summer so we are looking forward to better times next season . ^ it would be great if we could all connect at the  ame cottage at some point . ^  ame had his graduation from high school last friday night . ^ he is still there doing his last  ame 's but  um graduates the fall after completing the 5th english course and since he doubled up last year , he graduated this fall . ^ it was a very nice do . ^  um kids got diplomas and we had cake and ice cream back at  ame and grandpa 's place with family and friends . ^  ame and his friends then left to camp out at another friend 's for the night ( hold the thought it is october of a wet and cold season here ) at any rate , they had a good time so i guess they did n't notice the cold / ^ how is school going ? ^ your mum said you had been in  ame on a field trip ? ? ^  ame all is well and interesting for you . ^  ame and i are both busy with schoolwork . ^ i have a student teacher with me from the university of  ame so that is fun , interesting , neat and lots of work for me ( the paperwork just never ends ) we just had thanksgiving weekend so it was nice to have an extra day to sleep in. ^ that 's about all the news from here . ^ take care and we 'll look forward to hearing from you soon . ^ love  ame (  ame and  ame too ) </text_normal><text_embedded> ^ hello ! ^ ( and sorry about the blanket e-mail ! ) ^ yes , the time has come once more , for e-mails from  ame . ^ having returned to college , and been locked out of my flat ( i 'll explain later . ) i am writing now to you . ^ i have had a good , if busy summer . ^ it seems so long ago since i was here in this computer room , sending e-mails . ^ let me try to summarize what i have been up to this holiday . ^  um ) work . ^ i have been punting on the river in  ame , taking all the rich tourists ( and some of the poorer one as well ) along the backs of the famous colleges , and allowing them to scream with delight at the sight of  ame college chapel , and other such places . ^ it was a good job , as it built up my muscles , kept me fit , and it allowed me to talk all day . ^ ( even if i was saying the same thing ! ) i calculated that i must have given the river tour between  um and  um times this holiday . ^ not bad eh ? ^ at the end of the summer term , i returned to  ame . ^ that night  ame cooked a wonderful meal ( as only she can do ) , and then , realizing that i was foolish enough to have said that i would be at work the next day , went to bed . ^ then next day was enjoyable , and by " enjoyable "  um mean " hard work " . ^ the rest of the summer continued along the same lines . ^ i worked  um days a week , and then had  um days  ame , off ! ^  ame ! ^ towards the end of the summer the weather turned foul , and the tourists migrated on further south , leaving  ame as a desolate wasteland . ^ ( well , maybe not , but that sounds dramatic , does n't it ? ) anyway , there were now tourists , so there was no money . ^ oh well . ^ what else did i do with my summer ? ^  um ) painting . ^  ame  ame wanted the side of the house painted , i , nor anyone else ever really got around to doing it . ^ instead , though , i did paint a portrait of moi , and worked a bit more or some other  ame stuff as well . ^ i suggested that i bring the picture of me to college to hang in my flat , but my flat mates , all being good christians and not wanting to be tempted into worshiping an idol , thought it better if i left it at home . ^  miley ^  um ) novel . ^ continuing along the creative front , for some reason , i decided to write a novel . ^ it was something that i have never tried before , but i thought that i would give it a go . ^ actually , it started out as a short story , but as time , and the page count went by , it became a short novel . ^ lots of fun ! ^ i do n't really know how good it is , but i am enjoying working on it . ^ if you want to know what type of story it is , it is very hard to put into any normal genre . ^ i suppose it is a historical adventure and romance . ^ there you go , i created a new genre as well . ^  ame , i 'm good ! ^  miley ^  um )  ame other stuff . ^ i did keep the rest of my time quite stuffed with things to do . ^ ( as usual ! ) ^ when i returned to college today ( sunday ) , i arrived at my flat , which college owns , and found that the flat key was not available until monday morning ! ^  ame eh ? ^ so tonight , i will be sleeping in a friend 's flat . ^ are n't friends wonderful ? ^ anyway , i should probably sort some other college things out now , ^ hope you are well , ^ take care &  ame  ame , ^  ame ^  ame  ame  ame ^ st.  ame 's college  um  ame  ame  ame  ame  ame ^ department of geological sciences university of  ame </text_embedded></message_body></message>
