^ is there any way that i could have the poster in a format that all the componants are independant of each other ? 
^ what i 'd really like is the poster as it it minus the price info and the bit at the bottom .

^ what font is the text on the poster ? 
^ i 've been investigating photocopying . 
^ the best place seems to be 'mail boxes etc " on regent st , which is 3p per copy inc paper , so that 's 6p per sheet and 24p a prog .

^ thanks , &name .
