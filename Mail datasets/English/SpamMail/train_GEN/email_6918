^ hi 
^ just to say that the backup script has been updated for the new &name and &char ile layout , and viewcvs ( web-viewable &name ) also now works with it . 
^ however , the makedocs script which creates &name and &name files is going to take me a bi &char longer , since the &name folder was a flat structure and the new documentati on folder has a number of different levels . 
^ it 'll probably therefore be saturday rather than tomorrow that i 'll have that finished . 
^ &name that 's acceptable to everyone . 
^ see you tomorrow , 
^ &name 
^ &name cornish room &name , &name &name &name college , &name &name &name &name : # &num | &name : &email &name : &num &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &name &num
