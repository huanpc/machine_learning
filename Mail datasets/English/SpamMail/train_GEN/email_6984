^ &num ) saturday : please let me know where and when you would like &name to be so that i can liaise with him and meet him and bring him to the right places at the right time ! 
^ if you could do this as soon as possible that would be great , as he wants to know . 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'll get back to you on this- i 'd have thought that if 3.30ish is n't too early to ask him to arrive , it might be an idea for him to come to the chapel then at the end of the rehearsal , to see &name ? 
^ then if we 're having a prayer meeting from around &num , he might like to join us for that ? 
^ then there 'll be time for him to eat and get ready before it all begins . 
^ i 've emailed the tape secs to check that there 'll be enough time 
^ &num 15-7.30ish to sort out recording with him . 
^ &name may prefer to arrive a bit later , so these are only tentative suggestions- i 'll get back to you with something more definate ...

^ just realised &char forgot about &name / &name ! 
^ on a previous email you sent , &name , it says bt will be &num . 
^ is that correct?- &name does n't usually take &num 40mins ... i 'm just wondering when would be the best time for us all ( or as many as poss ) to get together and pray on the day ? 
^ &name will be in evensong at &name from &num ( to get a head start in setting up ) , and rehearsals go on till &num ... from &num after evensong , setting up and audience admission begin . 
^ any ideas ? 
^ &name &name be able to use the prayer points i 've sent you for &name ? 
^ it would be great if people could be praying for the evening then &smiley i 'll try to make sure that at least one of the admin team is there to fill everyone in on the latest . 
^ love &name
