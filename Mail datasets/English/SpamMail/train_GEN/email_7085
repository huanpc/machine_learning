^ &name , 
^ i have checked the rota , and if you can do the morning service this sunday , that would be great ! 
^ i have just sent you an e-mail about the sunday evening service too . 
^ . 
^ . 
^ i could n't remember whether it was sunday evenings or thursday evenings which were bad for you - if you ca n't make it do n't worry . 
^ i might be stuck for a reader for tomorrow yet , so if thursday evenings are better than sunday we could swap !
