^ i emailed dad about not being done exams so i doubt he 'd read it when i spoke to him . 
^ but who cares ? 
^ &name it 's all over . 
^ &name . 
^ &name went ok i think - there were a few questions i did n't have a scooby about but i just wanted it to be over and &name was waiting for me at the &name so i just guessed and left . 
^ but it was n't as hard as i thought it would be . 
^ but i still probably fucked up and did n't realize ( realise ? 
^ - bloody north american spelling) . 
^ but final grades are n't being posted til after the exam period which finishes the day i get home so we 'll wait and see . 
^ although sociology posted grades - i do n't know if they 're just exam grades or our final &num for the yr but i have an &num which i 'm quite chuffed with cuz sociology was a shower of shite so at least i got a good grade out of it . 
^ &name is &name &name . 
^ i went to school with her and she 's taking a gap yr in &name . 
^ i 'm sure i would 've told &char b4 - i went to the phonics with her and &name and we had our posse of brits . 
^ our long vodkas were magic by the way . 
^ it took us a couple of tries to get the mix just right but when we did . . ... mmmm mmmm . 
^ like being back at old deer ! 
^ &name . 
^ but we 'd started speaking about them last wk so &name found bitters and lime stuff for us and it was all good ! 
^ then we went to the scots corner last night and drank grouse and irn bru all night . 
^ mmmmmmmm. 
^ ca n't believe i have n't told &char about the hostel . 
^ when i went up to &name &num the weekend a while ago we stayed there . 
^ it has it 's own bar and i do n't know what it is but i just love the place . 
^ well , part of it is the fact that all the male staff are soooooo hot . 
^ &name mmm . 
^ am quite in love with the new australian guy &name and a guy that works the bar who i renamed &name cuz he has hair like &name &name . 
^ i do n't think he understood but all &name 's mates started calling hm it too so he did n't have much choice . 
^ but &name , so going to miss the hostel bar . 
^ so plan on making tonight a good one . 
^ ( our long vodka kit is all packed up and ready to go since no one here knows what they are and never have bitters so we 're taking our own . )

^ &name is n't finished - her exams do n't start for a wee while yet . 
^ but it was just i emailed her asking if she knew much about city link buses from &name to abdn and if i could get a bus from the airport bla bla bla . 
^ and she phoned and said she would easy take me home . 
^ which is &char nice of her . 
^ so yup , that 's the plan . 
^ altho i hope her driving 's a bit better than in the summer cuz i was quite scared when i was in her car . 
^ hmmm. ...

^ this may sound stoopid ( but hey , that 's me , especially now my exams are finished - brain melt-down and am now ( or more ) a thick bastard) . 
^ &name . 
^ but what exactly is a dissertation ? 
^ apart from long . 
^ and time-consuming . 
^ but good luck with it anyway , my sweet . 
^ and tell that boyf of your that i do n't care that he does n't say hiya cuz i know he smells . 
^ so nah . 
^ ok , must get on with study . 
^ oh , no , that 's all over . 
^ &name . 
^ but need to sort the rest of my shit out &name i get picked up . 
^ and i have to clean out the fridge cuz &name are in &name &name for a few days so they do n't want too much left in the fridge so me and &name 's instructions were to take anything we wanted . 
^ hopefully this includes the drink cabinet . 
^ &char ha ! 
^ &name luv , &name xx
