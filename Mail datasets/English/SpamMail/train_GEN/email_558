^ " they scruff their snouts along the ground trying to find them , it 's called truffling . " 
^ - you seem to be rather an authority on pigs . 
^ " i will come visit you , whenever i get my first invite ! " 
^ - you 're most welcome to come and see me anytime . 
^ i will be very pleased to see you , and you do n't need an invite ! 
^ but if you 're not busy on tuesday sometime then you have an invite .
