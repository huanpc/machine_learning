^ i think generally the &name graduation ceremonies are in december , january , &name , march , april , may and so forth . 
^ you can check with your college the date that they will slot you in. whilst the course finishes once your thesis has been approved ( in august ) , until the degree committee of the &org have met to ratify the final results ( in september ) and the &org have also met ( in october ) , you will not be awarded the &name &name degree . 
^ i hope that rather convoluted explanation helps !
