^ hi &name , 
^ sorry for the delay in email . 
^ things are a ltitle crazy here &smiley 
^ what &name documents are you talking about ? 
^ from what i can recall , we never made any . 
^ but i could just be forgetting . 
^ i did find an early version of the grammar which i am attaching with this email . 
^ but do n't just forward that on to christian because some of it was changed when we implemented it . 
^ the best thing to do would be to open up &name and see how the structure of the code differs from the document i sent you and update the document . 
^ it should be fairly logical how the code translates to the grammar if you look through it , even if you have n't taken &name yet . 
^ i hope all is well - good luck with your presentation at the &name meeting tomorrow &smiley

^ hey &name 
^ how 's it going there ? 
^ things are tough here . ... as always . 
^ i have join about to be coded . 
^ i will present it on friday and hope &name will like it . 
^ other than that , everything else is driving me crazy . 
^ ok ... here is where i need help . 
^ christian was documents on &name . 
^ the storage manager i think is planning to use &name for connection points . 
^ i looked around for the docs , but ca n't find anything besides the pseudocodes that i wrote . 
^ since you did most of the big stuff , i am assuming you have those saved somewhere . 
^ i checked the little laptop for your files but could not find them . 
^ so i would be very grateful if you could send those files to me - of course if you have them . 
^ otherwise , i will try to write up something to give to christian . 
^ thanks 
^ cheers ! ! ! ! ! !
