^ hey &name , 
^ firstly , thanks for testing the packages . 
^ we need more people to do this . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ when i try to run the mplayer application after a successful installation i get the following error . 
^ missing library &name 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ ok , so mplayer needs this in order to be able to do the text mode progress status updates and so on . . ... most distros have this . 
^ &name may not . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i install the the sdl.package also successfully . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ ok , this is good to know . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ however when i type in a terminal window mplayer that is the error that comes up . 
^ i though autopackage is suppose to install without any dependency problems??&smiley note : i am running knoppix &num

^ &name . 
^ the basic problem here is autopackage cannot magically solve dependency problems . 
^ if an autopackage needs another package , then we can do our best to find and install this package first , but that 's all it is - our best attempt . 
^ we reckon that when we 're done ( that wo n't necessarily be by version &num btw ) we will be a lot better at this than other systems are , but that does n't mean we will always succeed &num . 
^ at the moment , we can only do this for software that is also packaged as an autopackage . 
^ so , if you ran the mplayer installer , and it detected that &name was missing , it should have automatically gone and installed &name for you as well . 
^ did it , or did you have to do that manually ? 
^ unfortunately , because this mplayer package is a preview release only , we did n't spend much time on producing it . 
^ so , we missed the dependency on termcap , or rather &name who packaged it decided not to produce the necessary code to autodetect it because &num of the time it will be there already . 
^ in theory , if we had packaged libtermcap as well , you could have &num .package files in the same directory : 
^ mplayer-0.90.package sdl-whatever.package libtermcap2.package 
^ and then you run the mplayer package and it 'd install termcap for you automatically . 
^ but , once you start doing that you hit a problem , as you can see mplayer needs quite a few things : 
^ * needed &name 
^ * needed &name needed &name needed &name needed &name needed &name 
^ * needed libgtk-1.2.so.0 
^ * needed libgdk-1.2.so.0 
^ * needed libgmodule-1.2.so.0 
^ * needed libglib-1.2.so.0 needed &name needed &name needed &name needed libx11.so.6 needed &name needed libsdl-1.2.so.0 needed &name 
^ * needed &name needed &name needed ld-linux.so.2 
^ the * marks the &num we check for . 
^ as you can see , we skipped quite a few . 
^ in future , we 'll check for them too , but as this was a " technology preview " release , ie autopackage is n't done yet , we do n't check for all those things because they are normally always present . 
^ even when we check for everything , some stuff we simply * cannot * install . 
^ libc.so is provided by your distro and is always present . 
^ the idea is that in future , when we detect that something is missing , we try and ask the distro itself to install it . 
^ in your case , something like this will do the trick : 
^ apt-get install termcap 
^ ( assuming termcap is the name debian use ) . 
^ so , our job then becomes figuring that this is the command we need to run . 
^ that code simply is n't written yet , and wo n't be for some time - read , probably about &num months . 
^ in this case the problem is that you 're running &name as a distro , which is wierd . 
^ in future yes , we 'll be able to deal with this , the design is meant to make this possible . 
^ but it 's not all written yet . 
^ feel free to help out &smiley 
^ thanks -mike
