^ &name mining aims to automatically and reliably extract prototypical facts from large text collections such as company take-overs ( news ) , protein-interactions ( functional genomics ) , missile tests ( defence ) etc. . 
^ typical approaches based on information extraction technology will usually focus on shallow semantics such as named entities in order to build up a template view of part of the text but this approach suffers from not being able to offer the computer a deeper understanding of the mined information or allowing this deeper understanding to feed back and influence the tempate filling process . 
^ in order to increase portability of knowledge and to allow the text mining system to incorporate deeper semantic knowledge of concept classes , properties ( slots ) , relations and axioms we are developing a front-end environment which allows domain-experts to specify such knowledge cooperatively online in the form of an ontology . 
^ once an ontology has been agreed , a representative set of texts can be annotated according to the specified classes and given to the information extraction system to learn from so that future texts in the domain can be automatically mined for similar facts . 
^ this talk introduces an overview of the system and also focuses in some detail on experiments we have recently done using support vector machines in extending the named entity task to domain-based terminology identification and classification for functional genomics .
