^ &name
^ at a recent seminar for leadership and management , the strengths and weaknesses of a good leader were discussed . 
^ when the session was over , a young burmese man approached the speaker and asked , " how can i change my personality , when it has been determined by the stars on the day i was born ? " 
^ most burmese people still believe strongly that their date of birth , and even the exact time of the day they were born , has a deep and lasting influence on their personalities . 
^ they believe that their lives are determined in a fatalistic way ; nothing can be done about it until they come under the influence of another star , at which point they change accordingly . 
^ for example , a person born on monday remains under the influence of the moon for &num years . 
^ then he passes into the house of &name and sojourns there for &num years . 
^ at the age of &num , he moves on and into &name 's domain , and so on . 
^ when a child is born , a careful note is made of the exact hour of birth , with the purpose of drawing up the sada or certificate of birth . 
^ every &name person has such a sada , which he consults , with the help of an astrologer , for the fixing of fortunate days and hours throughout his life . 
^ on the other side are a number of squares and numbers from which the future calculations are made ( see below )
