^ hi &name , 
^ now that the demo is over and that filter and map are done , we were wondering if you were available to help us out on another box : &name . 
^ this box takes input from a variable number of input streams and puts them together in &num output " fat " stream ( maintaining the input stream ids ) . 
^ ( professor &name - let us know if i did n't get that right ) 
^ what i think makes this task non-trivial is that right now the whole project assumes that there is maximum &num inputs to any box . 
^ this will mean communicating with the &name people to allow the user to enter more than &num input streams , and changing &name to have variable length input streams instead of &name and &name and changing &name etc. to pass these streams correctly to the &name box . 
^ let me know if you think you will have time to do this , &name
