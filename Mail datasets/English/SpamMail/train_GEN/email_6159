^ hi &name , hope you 're well , sorry we could n't get hold of you earlier so went through &name instead . 
^ basically &name 's been talking to various key performers who really would n't be prepared to pay &pound; &num for a curry so late at night ... his point is really that people have given up a lot of time for this , in the 'real " world , organisers would have to pay performers a lot to get them to do this , but obviously it 's different with student things- the " norm " is a party to thank them for all their hard work . 
^ &name 's also worried about the signals it could send about &name / christianity if we do n't have such a party , in that it could be seen as being ungrateful to the performers , or that if you 're a christian you 're not allowed to have parties or drink any alcohol ... his idea was to provide some wine plus plenty of soft alternatives and snacks . 
^ he estimated this would cost approx &pound; &num , and it 's been suggested that since we do n't have this sort &char &char money to throw around , all the admin team members / &name people who would have gone to the curry and spent &pound; &num could put about this amount towards such a party . 
^ &name 's already provisionally booked a room for this , and feels so strongly that he 'd pay for it initially ( on credit , as he ca n't really afford it ) and then hope that he 'd somehow be partially reimbursed from somewhere ... sorry i do n't know whether this all makes sense , i 'm not really awake at the &name ( ! ) but something needs to be decided before the afternoon rehearsal ( 2pm ) at the very very latest so that something can be worked out and performers can be informed . 
^ if at all poss , it would be good to know what you think before &num ( by phoning me ) . 
^ sorry this is all &char last minute ... and i 'm afriad this is n't the only thing that 's a bit last minute ... 
^ about half the programmes are now folded and stapled- as we all began to relax and count them to make sure we had enough , we found we only had about &num ! 
^ something 's evidently gone wrong here , as &name were told to do &num . 
^ there were some sheets which were unusable , since they only had &num side printed on , but even counting these , there 's a massive shortfall . 
^ there 's a vague possibility that we did n't collect them all from &name &name has a friend with the key to that building , so she 'll have a look tomorrow . 
^ but if we ca n't sort it out there , we 'll obviously need to go and do some more ... &name 's prepared to sort this , although this is another financial issue to be resolved at some point . . ... please pray &smiley sorry about this massive , rather negative sounding email- on the positive side of things , rehearsal went v well tonight , ticket sales seem to be going well- we only need &num adults / concessions on the door to break even according to the budget we had before today 's issues . 
^ i know &name will work it all out for good and for his glory , despite our weaknesses ! 
^ but i do apologise that we 've failed in many areas too- sorry . 
^ must go to bed now ! 
^ see you tomorrow , love &name
