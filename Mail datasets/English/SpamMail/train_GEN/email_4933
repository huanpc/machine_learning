^ i agree - if the user needs to know the original source of the tuple , he can add an additional attribute using a map box . 
^ if we go with this , then the output schema of a &name &name will be identical to the input schema , unless we agree when we meet on wednesday that stream id will be of variable length ( in which case the new stream id will likely be longer than the old &num ) .

^ &num clarification . 
^ the original restream proposal did indeed add one additional attribute to the result tuple , " oldsid " . 
^ however , since &name 's should be invisible ( and since they will probably be unreadable ) , i 'm now thinking that it should n't bother adding it . 
^ &name &name &num &num &num ( phone ) assistant professor , computer science &num &num &num ( fax ) &name university , &name &num &website ) &name , ma &num

^ hey &name , 
^ the restream box should display the input tuple schema and allow the user to select a subset of these attributes . 
^ the restream box will then add one extra field ( old stream id ) and will replace the stream id of the incoming tuples with a unique one that is dependent of the values of the group-by attributes . 
^ thus the output schema type will always be the same as the input schema type with &num extra string field ( old &name ) . 
^ yes , the union box does not need any kind of modifier . 
^ &name this helps , let me know if restream needs more explanation .

^ hey guys , &name just got a few questions about the restream and union boxes . 
^ i just got a bug report that says restream should only have &num column in which the user can select which attribute to group by on . 
^ can someone explain this to me ? 
^ apparently i didnt really have a healthy understanding of restream when i designed the properties dialog . 
^ also , as far as i can tell the union box does not need any sort of predicate / modifiers &name in the properties dialog because it always performs the same operation on the incoming streams . 
^ is this a correct assumption ? 
^ thanks
