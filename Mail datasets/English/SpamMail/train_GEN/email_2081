! ^ for the record the statistics are that you wrote about  um of you last e-mail on the wedding . ^ amazing ! ^ it sounds as if you had a really busy and mentally , emotionally , etc. exhausting few days . ^ i hope you enjoyed it and you have already said that it is a memory you will carry with you to your grave . ^ ( not in those exact words though ! ) i 'm kind of glad i do n't have an older sister to get married though it seems very strange . ^ so , who is it that you 're going on  ame camp with ? ^ well , i 've been on the camp now ( hence the lack of e-mails for which i apologise ) and it was fantastic . ^ i went with  ame  ame , whom i do n't know if you know . ^ she was a fourth year in  ame last year from  ame . ^ anyway , the camp was really good , although i am absolutely totally mind-numbingly exhausted . ^ i only got  um hours of sleep per night for the week . ^ sleeping in a dormitory with  um hyperactive , unnaturally energetic , ten-year old kids has many disadvantages . ^ however , i really enjoyed it all and the weather was perfectly splendid . ^ i knew a few people before i got there and knew a lot more by the time i left . ^ i just cannot understand how  ame can do one of those camps this  ame ! ^ she ca n't be human . ^ i was in  ame  ame yesterday ( not to see the golf , but to get a kettle ) and it was totally packed because of the open . ^ i 'm going to  ame on saturday though and looking forward to it all except the heat , the flight and the language difficulties . ^ i only speak scottish and english . ^ oh well ! ^ it will be an experience i am sure ! ^ okay  ame princess just what is this ? ? ? ^ discomknockerated ? ^ pinnickity ? ^ you 've got to be joking ! ^ let me know about when you come down to  ame . ^ i intend to go down to  ame on wednesday . ^ if you are coming down then you can either meet up with me during the day , or you can opt for the more interesting option ^ be in  ame station at  um : 30am . ^ make sure you are not followed . ^ avoid all radio communication . ^ leave you weapons behind . ^ embark upon coach  har on the ^ 09:  um train from  ame to  ame  ame street . ^ sit down in the seat next to the guy in the green hat . ^ he will offer you a black jelly baby . ^ take it , eat it , and say hello . ^ he will speak to you . ^ ask for another jelly baby . ^ well , the choice is yours . ^ also , how dare you quote me out of context - which you seem to do pretty often ! ^ simply because it 's fun ! ^ as to the  ame situation has  ame shed any more light on the subject yet ? ^ yes ! ^ have you been e-mailing him about  ame ? ^ it 's just that i received this email from him in which he called you a poor disillusioned girl from  ame who lost it somewhere . ^ here follows the full story , courtesy of  ame , just in case you have n't received it yet ^ it 's true ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ^ reports are coming in of sightings of a lifeless raven , lying below a tree somewhere in  ame . ^ it seems the raven in question was attempting some form of strange and twisted communication ritual involving bizarre movements of the head . ^ the word on the street is that this supposed raven could actually be the one known only as  ame , an intergalactic ambassador from the  har  ame . ^ we now turn to our reporter on the scene . ^ so , exactly how many reports have we had in ? ^ reporter : well ... actually not that many . ^ how many ? ^ reporter : well ... ummm ... not very many at all really . ^ how many ? ? ? ? ^ reporter : well , actually just the one . ^ just the one ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ^ who from ? ^ reporter : the eye-witness was  um  ame  ame , who appeared to be quite flustered and claimed she had seen the raven lying below the tree . ^ she also muttered something about being sick and tired of searching for  um . ^ we do not believe this had anything to do with her story however . ^ folks ! ! ! ! ! ^ i am hearing some breaking news . ... what ? ? ? . . ... surely not ! ! ! ! ! ^ . ^ folks , i have just heard from reliable sources that the whole story is a hoax - set up by some poor disillusioned girl from  ame who lost it somewhere during the search for this remarkable bird . ^ the name "  ame " has been banded about in relation to the  ame incident , and some say that the aforementioned persona has had contact with the raven since the reported 'death " of  ame . ^  um lives on ! ! ! ! ! ! ^ well , what do you think ? ^ my response is as follows ^ what ! ! ! ^  ame is dead ! ! ! ^ oh , thank goodness , it 's just a hoax ! ^ that had be badly shaken for a moment there . ^ do i take it rightly then ? ^ that you have performed an elaborate hoax by staging the death of  ame ? ^ just wait till i see you . ^ i am most displeased . ^ i arranged a legally binding contract with  ame 's  ame  ame ltd. i am not about to take this lying down . ^ some poor disillusioned girl from  ame who lost it ^ enough of the sympathy ! ^ this is serious now . ^  ame appeared to me in a dream last night . ^ ( i had eaten some cheese the night before ) here is what i can remember of my dream ^ as i slept , i saw a hazy black object speeding across a seemingly huge expanse of silvery grey sky . ^ as i watched , the object began to grow in size and became darker and blacker than the deepest hole or cave you can imagine . ^ what appeared to be stars began to spiral towards the object until there were so many that they flowed into it in the likeness of a milky river glistening with hundreds and thousands of precious stones . ^ then the scene changed suddenly . ^ i was standing on the top of a huge mountain , overlooking a city which i recognised . ^ as i watched , an arrow of flaming fire appeared from the north and sped down into the heart of the city . ^ sounds of wailing and moaning reached my ears as the entire city was consumed . ^ the scene changed once again . ^ i found myself standing on the banks of a cool shallow river . ^ on the opposite bank a shadowy figure was lurking . ^ i called on him in clear and ringing tones to show himself . ^ he wore darkness as a cloak and his face was more alive looking than any i had ever beheld . ^ he was a raven . ^ he spoke to me in a language i did not understand , using words  um cannot remember . ^ however , i understood his message . ^ his face began to swim before me - i could see cities , kings and nations in his eyes . ^ then all was black . ^ the dream is interpreted as follows ^ in the opening scene we see  ame winging his way across the hiajfhboj , which is the equivalent of the lowlands in his home planet of  ame sometimes described as planet of the  ame . ^ the increase in  ame 's size correlates to his flourishing knowledge of the ways of men . ^ his similarity to a black hole emphasises the idea persistent in siluhfodascian literature that they alone will  um day know everything , that there shall be no end to their knowledge and dominion . ^ the river of stars represent those who oppress and defy  ame , his people , the  ame , and their ways . ^ many are those , bright perhaps in their own way , but ultimately consumed . ^ this scene represents the power and majesty of the  ame . ^ the second scene portrays the judgement on those who diss  ame . ^ the city represents  ame and the judgement upon  ame for staging  ame 's death is inevitable . ^ [ this is a joke by the way  ame is probably a lovely place ] the arrow from the north is  ame , stationed as he is in some secret location near my abode . ^ this scene represents the terror and judgement of the  ame . ^ in the final scene the river portrays the uncrossable divide between the land of men and the  ame . ^ no man can ever set foot in  ame perhaps this is just as well . ^ the raven is a picture of  ame 's people . ^ their knowledge and antiquity burning bright but cloaked from us by vast distances in time and space . ^ telepathic thought as a means of communication is briefly referred to here . ^ the sudden end of the dream suggests a hint of what lies in the future for  ame . ^ could they be trying to pass on some of their ways and dominion to us as their time runs out . ^ this scene represents the personality and communicativeness of the  ame . ^ thank you . ^  ame of that what you will , but it 's message is startlingly clear to me . ^ i fear it came as a warning against us becoming to familiar with  ame as to stage elaborate hoaxes . ^ enough , no more , tis not as much as it was before -  ame . ^ well , why do n't you carry on the tale  ame ? ^ we would all appreciate some sort of defence from you in the midst of all these accusations of fraud and deception which are being flung at you . ^ i can only assume that you are making wild guesses and making things up ^ absolutely not . ^  ame and i have a very unique bond . ^ he followed me to  ame camp . ^ he observed me playing frisbee golf and football , was concealed in a tree as i was soaked with water by ten-year olds , peered through my dorm window as i caught some brief sleep . ^ yes , i have had contact with  ame , not to mention my dream . ^ such eyes are reserved for only  ame ^ i did not copy them from superman ! ^ honestly ! ^ i copied them from a book i read about  um years ago only it was vultures eyes there , and they were orange . ^ please give me a little more credit than that . ^ they would think i was mad associating with people who talk about such things ! ^ well , so would mine ! ^ to them the name of  ame is a dead secret . ^ all my e-mail transcripts and files in which he is mentioned are password-protected documents , with my disks under lock and key ! ^ that includes this one . ) ^ this thing has to be getting on for  um words - not that i 'm counting ! ^ yes ! ^  um to be accurate . ^ congratulations ! ^ well  ame ! ^ this one , i 'm afraid is not as long . ^ it is only  um . ^ well , please reply soon so that i know whether or not to bring some jelly babies on wednesday . ^ see you  ame . ^ i 'm slightly reluctant in writing the following , in case you think it 's scandalous and shocking , but i will anyway since  ame did to me and he 's the cu rep ! ^ yours in  ame , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
