^ i think not . 
</text_embedded>

</text_embedded>

^ do you have cold , wet fields in the vicinity that army types could run around in the dark in and try to shoot each other ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ hmmmm. there is " area &name " near &name which may might all your army exercise needs . 
^ if not , why not try the &name estate for riot control training - easily accessible and comes complete with violent townie types to expend . 
^ the other great offering ( for an indefinite period ) is the &name - perfect for those &name types who want to practise strafing columns of grid-locked &name tanks .
