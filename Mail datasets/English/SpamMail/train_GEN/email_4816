^ hi , 
^ attached with this email is a file with &name code &name and pseudocode implentation . 
^ the &name and pseudocode is separated into server side ( c++ ) code for box execution and client side ( &name ) code for what the &name calls when boxes , predicates , and functions are created . 
^ for the meeting at &num : &num tomorrow , the &name group will go over the first part of the document ( design issues ) and the client side &name and pseudocode . 
^ if you can , please print out and briefly look over the attached file before tomorrow 's meeting so that it will be easier to discuss as a group .
