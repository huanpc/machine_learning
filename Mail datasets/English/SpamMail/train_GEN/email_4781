^ hi &name , 
^ it appears that the emails you send do not have a " &name " field in their headers . 
^ without the content-type field , it is unclear how to interpret the content , and thus for safety sake , my system will remove such emails from the corpus . 
^ i cannot assume that emails that do n't have content-type fields are always in plain text , as this is not the case with some of the emails i have already collected . 
^ this means that you would get a blank response from the &name email thing . 
^ in this case i added a content-type field , specifying plain text so you should have got a reply anyway . 
^ have you got any idea why your email prog would leave out the content-type field ? 
^ do many others use the same email client ?
