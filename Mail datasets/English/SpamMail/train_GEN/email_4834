^ hi &name , 
^ let me rephrase my question about the quotation marks . 
^ if we stick with the &name standard and have quote marks as delimiters of the string , then the parser can recogize the string when it sees the first quotation mark , and can continue to read in the string until is sees the second quotation mark . 
^ however , if a quotation mark is found in the middle of the string ( like an apostrophe ) the parser is thrown off . 
^ i think there are &num solutions to this problem . 
^ either &num ) we use a delimiter that is not allowed to be in the string ( if it is a single quotation mark then we are disallowing apostrophes ) or &num ) an escape character is inserted before the delimiter if it occurs in the middle of the string . 
^ let me know which of the above options you prefer .

^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for you email . 
^ in response to your questions : 
<text_embedded> 

^ &num more question , how are you representing timestamps ? 
^ i want to make sure that we parse them in the right way . 
</text_embedded>

^ i did n't decide what to do for timestamps . 
^ as we decided in the previous meeting , i guess long is good enough for representing timestamps . 
^ in &name , long values are used to represent times in milliseconds since january &num , &num , &num : &num : &num &name . 
^ however , i do n't know what convention 's best to represent timestamp constants . ... there would be very many ways ! ! 
^ by the way , do you want to capture physical times ( e.g. , january &num , &num , 
^ 00: &num : &num &name ) or logical times ( some numbers just keeping time precedence or causal relationships ) ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ also , i want to make sure that string constants in the database will be surrounded by " quote marks . 
^ is this how you do it ? 
</text_embedded>

^ yes , i think we should follow the conventional sql formats . 
^ so i prefer to make string constants surrouneded by the quote mark 
<text_embedded> 

^ &num more question . 
^ if string constants begin and end with " , then will real occurances of the " be escaped '' ? 
^ will there be any other escape charaters that can be written out ? . 
</text_embedded>

^ i am sorry i do n't quite understand what the question is . 
^ i am just wondring if " and " are regarded as the same thing in strings . 
^ if i am right , i will use " for strings and " only for char constants . 
^ just refer to the following code : 
^ string &name , s2 ; &name " attr " aaa '' ; &name " attr " aaa '' ; cout ( ( s1 ( ( endl ( ( s2 ( ( endl ; cout ( ( " are '' ( ( s1 ( ( '' and '' ( ( s2 ( ( '' same ? 
^ " ; cout ( ( ( ( s1 s2 ) ? 
^ " yes " : " no " ) ( ( endl ; cout ( ( " is the 8th character in " ( ( s1 ( ( " ' ? 
^ " ; cout ( ( ( ( '' " s1 [ &num ] ) ? 
^ " yes " : " no " ) ( ( endl ; 
^ the answers to the questions are " yes " . 
^ thanks , 
^ &name .
