^ &name : 
^ this work paper proposes &num novel techniques designed to analyze the segmental intelligibility of accented pronunciation , both of which are based upon completely new and unique methods of observing and characterizing the accented pronunciation . 
^ the first technique , &name &name &name , extracts phonetic tree structure embedded in utterances of a student . 
^ results of analyzing japanese english visually and clearly present well-known japanese habits in speaking english . 
^ the second technique automatically estimates the segmental intelligibility not based upon acoustic matching with native speakers " utterances but based upon matching between &num structures , the extracted phonetic structure in the student 's pronunciation and the lexical structure in the target language 's vocabulary . 
^ the estimation is done using one of word perception models , cohort model , and the estimated cohort size is interpreted as degree of the segmental unintelligibility . 
^ experimental results show good accordance between the estimated intelligibility and the segmental proficiency rated by teachers .
