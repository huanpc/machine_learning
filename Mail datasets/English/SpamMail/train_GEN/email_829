^ &name & friends , 
^ interesting email . 
^ i do not think it is as clear-cut as your friend would have us think . 
^ just because science suggests something at this stage in history does n't mean that subsequent discoveries will not mean that our current hypotheses ( for after all , this is all we have ) must be radically changed / revised . 
^ having said that , it is obviously important not to ignore what science is telling us today , and since you obviously want to talk about 'scientific " issues , here is where i stand , for your perusal : 
^ age of the earth : i will make no statement on how old i think the earth is - i have no idea . 
^ if it is billions of years old , this does not affect my faith or my 'scientific " beliefs , but i do wonder what was happening during that vast length of time , and also why &name has told us nothing about it . 
^ if it is a number of thousands of years old then it does not surprise me . 
^ i do not have a problem at all with &name having 'deceived " us or something ( as your friend suggests ) . 
^ just because i cannot understand something in light of what i see around me ( science ) does not mean that the thing cannot be true and i must be right . 
^ &name : i do not think we evolved from lower species . 
^ the &name says that &name formed living beings to reproduce after their own kind . 
^ this law seems to be observable when we look at the product of cross-breeding ( sterility ) . 
^ i do not see any convincing evidence that evolution occurs , or occured , or ever would occur . 
^ this does not mean that i deny that within species one can observe favourable transformations ( aka fruit-fly experiments ) . 
^ being a computer scientist ( & working with statistics , orders of complexity , etc. ) , it is clear to me that the kinds of odds against special evolution are extraordinary - the law of thermodynamics indicates that this stands against the natural order of nature , and such concepts as the formation of &name are inconceivable by any other means than design . 
^ without coming from a standpoint of " evolution must have occurred " &num cannot see the evidence from the fossil record - surely we would expect thousands ( millions ) of gradual semi-formed organisms . 
^ in fact , most of our knowledge about 'missing links " is founded on fragments of bone . 
^ evolutionists can hardly even show us the complete skeletal structure of a single " primate-man " . 
^ if science rests on evidence then i see no reason to suspect that special evolution might be true . 
^ any other issues - let me know .

^ guys , i hummed and hawed about sending this on to you , as i 've only just cooled down from the weekend , and i do n't want to get het up about it again , but i sent an e-mail to &name &name , a geologist in &name , who is in my home group , and whom i hold in the highest respect re our favorite topic . 
^ for the sake of both sides , read what he says . 
^ you do n't have to , and i do n't want this to divide our friendship , guys , but i thought that i would keep screaming in my head if something was n't said . 
^ love you all loads , and thanks for the great day yesterday . 
^ &name 
^ hi &name , 
^ thanks for the emails - you obviously had a great time away ! 
^ as to the creation / &name earth business . 
^ do n't get too upset about it . 
^ i think people are doing a great deal of harm , but they are usually willing to say &name is white when pressed . 
^ saying that radiometric dating is unreliable is as silly as saying radio waves are unreliable ( when you change to channel &num , you usually get something with pictures and sound , unless there is a freak weather situation ) . 
^ likewise dating . 
^ when several different decay schemes are used on the same rock , each with its own different half life , and give the same age ( concordance ) the method ca n't be said to be false . 
^ the half lives of some decay schemes are among the most precisely measured constants in physics - e.g. the &name clock which now replaces our world 's measurement of time . 
^ &name can go wrong - things such as weathering , or reheating rocks above their &name temperature ( which resets their clocks ) can occur - but they are the analog of the freak weather conditions in the tv example - understandable situations which can usually be checked . 
^ i also do n't believe our &name plays silly games with us . 
^ he would not give us the gift of scientific enquiry only to turn round and say - &name ha ! 
^ i only put those old-looking fossils there to fool you . 
^ i think a lot of the problems people with a young earth viewpoint have stem with a fear that &num day science may pull the carpet of faith from under them . 
^ but if &name has made everything , science will never undermine what he 's done or prove he did n't do it ! 
^ below i have lifted out bits of articles from the christians in science website . 
^ it is well worth looking at some of the material there , and following links to other articles and books . 
^ &name the term goes well ( and exams are not too harsh )
