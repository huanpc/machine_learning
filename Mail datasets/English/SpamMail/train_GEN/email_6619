^ dear cums chorus , 
^ as some of you may have already discovered from a note that was surreptitiously passed round last thursday 's rehearsal , &char ( an undergraduate 
^ cums member called &name ) am doing a sponsored hitch-hike to &name this 
^ &name to raise money for the excellent charity link community development who run education projects in some of the poorest countries of &name . 
^ many 
^ of you kindly pledged your sponsorship in response to the note last thursday , but it somehow got waylaid and did n't make it to the tenor and bass section , or the altos , so i thought i 'd write an email to make up for that ! 
^ i will be there next thursday with a sponsorship form and if any of you who 
^ have n't done so already would like to sponsor me , it would be enormously appreciated - even &num or &num pounds will go a long way . 
^ link is an amazing 
^ charity and the money will be used to train teachers and provide materials for schools - the current programme stands to affect the lives of &num , &num children across &name . 
^ with your help i will soon reach my target of &pound; &num ! 
^ please bring a cheque book with you on thursday if you 'd like to sponsor me 
^ thank you very much ( for reading this far if not for donating ! ) 
^ &name
