^ so was &name &name . 
^ me and &name were going to go but had too much work to do . 
^ either that or we were skint ! 
^ the proclaimers was last night and they were fucking magic as usual . 
^ &name would have got us in downstairs but we didnt click how he would manage until it was too late ! 
^ me and &name were devastated that we had to sit . 
^ the supernaturals were the support and they were pretty damn good . 
^ specially when they sang my theme song ! 
^ &name is only a few weeks away so im chuffed about that . 
^ me and &name going .

^ from : " &name " to : " &name " , " &name " subject : oh yes &name : wed , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &num 
^ &name &name , 
^ you are going to be soooooooooo jealous . 
^ yes , yes you are . 
^ what did you &num do for bonfire night ? 
^ we went down to midsummer &name ( big bit of grass ) for the fireworks ( boring ) and then .. wait for it ... &name &name ! ! ! 
^ oh yes ... 
^ also , liberty ( we 'd never heard of them , but i 'm assuming you both know they 're the popstars rejects ... ) and &name &name . 
^ how exciting . 
^ yes , yes it was . 
^ see attached photos . 
^ i really do n't remember him being so ugly . 
^ hmmm. .. but anyway , he 's lost the mullet ( very sad ) and dances very badly . 
^ and mimes unbelievably badly . 
^ and thinks he 's sooooooooo coooooooooooooool . 
^ but is not . 
^ oh , but his guitarist , &name ( possibly his brother / &name lover ... personally i think brother ) is very * very * nice . 
^ &name . 
^ he was also very amusing . 
^ they did &num songs . 
^ his coming single ( yes ... he 's going to release another song ! ) , some other song noone knew , " american pie " ( which was actually quite good , especially with &name etc singing " the day the mullet died " over the top of him ... ) and then " the &num and only " ! 
^ &name ! 
^ it was classy . 
^ i knew you 'd be jealous . 
^ so anyway , that 's enough about that . 
^ what 's happening at new year ? 
^ &name , will you be home still ? 
^ i 've been planning on phoning home to speak about christmas and stuff all this week , but stuff keeps happening . 
^ like &name . 
^ ooooh . 
^ so anyway , yes . 
^ christmas . 
^ my point being that &name appears to have told dad ( i do n't know where she got this from ... ) that i 'd be coming home for christmas with &name . 
^ which is less than true . 
^ it being false . 
^ with it being &name " 21st on the 23rd of december , i 've been invited down to his house and then to stay for christmas , since travelling back would be a nightmare . 
^ so after checking with various parents etc. . 
^ it has been decided the best plan would be for me to go down to &name " for christmas , then both of us to come back up to the &name for new year . 
^ so now i have to tell people this is what 's actually happening , not what &name appears to be telling people . 
^ but dad wo n't be in tonight , he tells me , so i ca n't phone to confirm . 
^ so i thought i 'd email my lovely sisters and tell them instead . 
^ &name that 's almost the same . 
^ but then i realised i did n't have any so i emailed you &num instead . 
^ yes , yes i did . 
^ i 'm bored . 
^ i 'd better do some work though . 
^ oh , i got your postcard , &name . 
^ &name . 
^ i have n't bought you one . 
^ and i probably wo n't . 
^ &name ha . 
^ anyway ... 
^ see yous ,
