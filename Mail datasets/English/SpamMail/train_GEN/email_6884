^ hi , i see the account was created earlier today with just &email authorised to access it . 
^ i 've added yourself to the list too . 
^ that leaves the other &num , none of who currently have &name accounts . 
^ you should get them to e-mail &email requesting a personal account -- once those are set up i can grant access to the &name space . 
^ it will speed things up if in their request they give consent for the following information to be stored on the system : ( otherwise we have to e-mail them back to ask for that permission ) 
^ - surname 
^ - forename 
^ - initials 
^ - crsid ( i.e. &name , like the first part of your email address ) 
^ - email address 
^ - member status ( user , in your case ) 
^ - date joined 
^ regards , &name
