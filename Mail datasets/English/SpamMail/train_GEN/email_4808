^ hi professor &name , 
^ in order to study for the final for &name , i think we need to get the solutions for &name on the webpage as soon as possible . 
^ while i have the answers to the decision support questions , i do not have them for the security and benchmarking questions . 
^ when are you getting back from the &name meetings ? 
^ should i ask &name to let me into your office again to get them ? 
^ also , there is a question on the newsgroup on getting &name back . 
^ is there any need to get it back before the final ( or on the final ) ? 
^ &name says he does not have much time right now to grade it , and i would not have a problem holding the problem sets and giving them to students who want them after they are done being graded . 
^ would it be ok with you if we do not hand back &name in class ? 
^ &name
