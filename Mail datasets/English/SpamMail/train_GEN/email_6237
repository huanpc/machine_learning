^ have you changed some of my settings ? ? 
^ when i have a message box like when i close a prog and it asks if &char want to save &char normally press &name to get to the no button . 
^ now when &char press &name it jumps to another programme ! 
^ i 'm not annoyed - do n't worry ! 
^ i just want to know how to get it back the way &char like it . 
^ thanks ! 
^ yes , i maliciously changed all your settings so that your computer would play tricks on you and annoy you for the rest of your days . ... 
^ &name ! 
^ just the sort of thing that comp scis do to try and show how clever they are and boost their egos ! !

^ seriously , i did n't change anything to my knowledge and the above behaviour sounds more like a stuck &name key than anything else . 
^ try the following . 
^ hit ( give a good firm press on ) the following keys &num times : &name ( left ) &name ( left ) &name ( left ) &name ( left ) &name &name ( right ) &name ( right ) &name ( top of your keyboard ) &name ( right ) &name ( right ) and everything should be back to normal . 
^ it 's a trick worth remembering - you can really impress people by doing this since it looks like you 're just giving the computer a good bashing and then it suddenly , as if by magic , works again &smiley it did the trick , but was the whole of my keyboard supposed to go down when &char pressed they keys ? ?

^ ps revamping &name bit but do n't understand some of what &name " friend has written . 
^ shall &char ask &name ? 
^ &name , since he 'll have a much better ( some ? ! ) idea than me ... 
^ and he 's the one that wants to be fussy anyway 0&smiley
