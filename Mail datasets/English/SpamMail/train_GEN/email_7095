^ no worries .

^ hope i get better soon , and have a good christmas if i do n't see you before you go

^ ok , i 've cancelled , thanks for allowing me to do so . 
^ i 'm sorry &char ) for the short notice &char ) that this puts pressure on you next term &char ) for being a nuisance 
^ if we put num analysis sufficiently early in term , then it should n't interfere with timetabling heavily , because it 'll be a little time before supervisions get going for the new topics . 
^ given that you 've already done the work , i would n't have thought it should take you very long to refresh yourself before the supervision and we were due to have one on the first thursday back anyway . 
^ anyway , sorry again and many thanks for accomodating me . 
^ have a good christmas if i do n't see you before

^ &name , &char suppose we could delay the supervision til next term , its just i have quite a few supervisions now lined up for the first few weeks , which is going to be difficult for me , as &char only arrive back in the country on the first day of term , and hence have very limited time to refresh myself on the work we did this term . 
^ also a little more notice would have been handy as &char spent a long time working yesterday on the work for numerical analysis , which i could have otherwise spent on my computer design work . 
^ sorry i have n't got back to you earlier , but &char only got back from &name after &num and had to go straight back out , as a friend was having a big dinner for their birthday . 
^ i 'll leave the decision up to you , as i 've already handed in teh work to &name , but if you have n't done any then as you said there is not much point for you to go . 
^ please let me know what you want to do . 
^ thanks

^ i 've not been particularly well for the last few days and consequently i have n't done the work for &name for our sup tomorrow . 
^ neither have i really been able to look over the course properly in order to either understand it or have questions ready for the supervision . 
^ from these perspectives , there is little point in me having the supervision tomorrow . 
^ however , i realise that you have spent the time doing the work and gone to the trouble of going through the course . 
^ therefore it would be reasonable of you , if you did n't want to cancel . 
^ i 'll therefore leave the choice up to you . 
^ do you want to go ahead with the supervision as planned or to cancel / postpone it ? 
^ thanks ,
