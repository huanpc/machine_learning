^ &num has &name &name got back to you with travel costs ? 
^ if so , perhaps you could let &name know these so arrangements can be made for reimbursing him . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ he has n't got back to me yet . 
^ i 'll let &name know as soon as he does .

^ &num i have various things in my room which now belong to &name . 
^ these include a load of gospels , various items of stationary , a long-armed stapler , name badges ( used for stewards , but can be reused ) , lots of spare programmes ( i assume you just want me to recycle these ) and a bottle of wine . 
^ please let me know to whom these things should go ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ please do recycle the programmes . 
^ maybe i could collect the gospels , stationary , badges and stapler from you sometime soon .

^ 
^ &num i assume the aim is for you to be able to report fully on the concert at &name so we need to have debriefed and given you our thoughts well before then ? 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i do n't think there 'll be time for a big report in &name - we like to use that to put proposals forward and for people to bring up any questions they have . 
^ i will mention it briefly , giving praise to &name for using it , and would be good to give a financial summary if you have that by then . 
^ also , tomorrow night ( monday ) we have an exec meeting and &name would like to de-brief slightly on the concert as we have n't been able to get around to it yet ! 
^ if there 's anything useful you 'd like us to discuss that would be great . 
^ also , is there 's anything he thinks still needs to be done ? 
^ is a financial breakdown available ... ? 
^ anything else that might be useful ? 
^ thanks very much , &name you 're well , love &name
