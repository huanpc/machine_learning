^ the way &name are used in all applications is that they provide different views to the same data . 
</text_embedded>

^ certainly not . 
^ do all my konqueror &name show the same data ? 
^ do all my kspread sheets ( &num per &name ) show the same data ?

^ you are right ; and i should not have taken the shortcut in my explenation . 
^ in these cases the widgets that are outside the &name ( and thus common to the different pages ) make a very clear what they do . 
^ as soon as i put a button outside the &name , like , for example , an " apply " button the content of all &name is to be applied . 
^ if a widget outside of the &name ( like the location bar of konq ) does not show its different between the &name then it becomes cumbersome to use . 
^ and last , but not least . 
^ we read from left to right , top to bottom . 
^ when a button is outside and below the &name the user has just seen the different &name and the button is 'seen " as a button for all &name . 
^ this is why the kfind dialog would be horrible when the buttons are not at the right but at the bottom ( try it &smiley

^ &name , quick scetch attached that might not be the end-all , but should at the very least prove to solve more problems then most ideas i have seen so far .

^ this would still open a modal dialog ( the file dialog ) above the template chooser dialog ( modal too ) - is n't that considered bad practice ?
