^ &name : 
^ the &name &name initiative is a seed activity in the design and development of a new type of treebank . 
^ while several medium- to large-scale treebanks exist for english and some other languages , pre-existing publicly available resources exhibit &num or more of the following limitations : ( &char ) &name is monostratal , either encoding topological ( phrase structure ) or dependency information , ( ii ) the depth of linguistic information recorded is relatively shallow , ( iii ) the design and format of linguistic representation in the tree-bank hard-wires a small , predefined range of ways in which information can be extracted from the treebank , and ( iv ) representations in existing treebanks are static , creating challenges both for consistency during the development of a large-scale treebank , and for relevance over time as the field advances . 
^ &name &name aims at the development of a novel treebanking methodology , rich in nature and dynamic both in the ways linguistic data can be retrieved from the treebank in varying granularity and in the constant evolution and regular updating of the treebank itself . 
^ since july &num , the project hsa been working to build the foundations for this new type of treebank , developing improved tools for treebank construction and maintenance , and constructing an initial set of &num , &num annotated trees hand-selected from the full set of analyses for each example produced by the &name english resource grammar ( &name ) . 
^ both the tools and the data are distributed together with the &name system and the &name under an open-source license . 
^ in this talk i provide an overview of the redwoods initiative , demonstrate the available tools , and report on the current results of the first update of the treebank to reflect improvements in the &name during the period from july &num to october &num .
