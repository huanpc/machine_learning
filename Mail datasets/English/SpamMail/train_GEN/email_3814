^ &name , not sure that the &name &name were intending to be nutty when they wrote about wrapping cars around trees ! 
^ is n't that quite a sad song ? 
^ mind you , &name tells me half the &name and &name songs that i think are really fun are actually serious social commentaries ! 
^ i did n't mean that missing &name was pathetic , just that , looked at from mum and dad 's perspective , we may seem pathetic sometimes . 
^ anyways , we can talk more on the weekend if you like . 
^ " &name the reason to be jolly ( fa la la la la ) " ,

^ &name &name ,

^ &name , sounds like a very strange weekend indeed . 
^ i think i know what you mean about trying to be independent in a dependent way . 
^ i suppose it is most obvious when we make wrong choices ( independently of &char & &char ) , and then are told they are wrong by &char or &char rather than discovering this on our own ( as an independent individual would ) . 
^ it does n't help that while i am independent by necessity ( distance , etc ) you are independent by choice ( maturity , etc ) which is probably harder for &char & &char to deal with . 
^ incidentally , i 'm sure it 's hard for both of them but mum is the more outspoken . 
</text_embedded>

^ well , i only think i am independant because of college , and it was the natural thing to do . 
<text_embedded> 

^ someone once said : 
^ " you know you 're still young when you 're reminiscing about last year . " 
</text_embedded>

^ i did n't get that the first time around , but it makes sense . 
^ when you become &name , you reminice about &num years &name ! 
<text_embedded> 

^ i do n't wish it was last year but i can imagine that you do . 
^ you certainly had a lot of good things going for you . 
^ i was wondering how you see this msc fitting into your " career plan " that you drafted up at the end of the summer , given your comments to me that you did n't want to do a phd ? 
</text_embedded>

^ i very much &name this fitting into my career plan , as it seems to have more social consequences than straight geology , and might prove very interesting as &char &name . 
^ we shall &name what &name . 
<text_embedded> 

^ do n't worry about missing &name . 
^ even when we were first going out i missed &name , though i did n't always know what it was that i missed about her . 
^ it is difficult , i know . 
^ i 'm sure mum 's perspective is a right one , too , but she has the advantage of &num years of marriage , whereas we do n't have that stability yet . 
^ so i guess the ( sometimes somewhat pathetic ) missing of &name / &name is just a reflection of a desire for some assurance that everything is still okay . 
^ &name , i realise in re-reading that paragraph why i am not a relationship counsellor . 
^ very clumsily put , but do you get what i 'm saying ? 
</text_embedded>

^ &char get what you are saying , but &name . 
^ i would n't &name that my missing of &name is pathetic , and it is n't just the assurance that i want . 
^ she is my best friend so i miss her , just as i miss &name and you but &name because she is more than a friend . 
<text_embedded> 

^ i 'm glad that you did enjoy some aspects of the weekend ! 
^ i 'll do my best to be entirely wicked next weekend to take the heat off you . 
^ look out &name ... which bone will it be ? 
^ &smiley 
</text_embedded>

^ &name ! 
^ i 'll be a very good little boy ... humm . 
^ how does one do that ? 
<text_embedded> 

^ &name of the day for visual &name ... test your code as you go along . 
^ do n't try and write huge sections at once as debugging is a lot harder that way ! 
</text_embedded>

^ speak on brother . 
^ i 'm listening to the divine comedy right now as i work , and it is absolutely nutty . 
^ very good &name though . 
^ " we wrapped your daddy 's &name around the tree .. " 
^ keep well . 
^ &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ everything you 'll ever need on &num web page from &name and sport to email and music charts &website
