^ previously made by &name &name in &num as the american friend , &name 's game is an acute and complex study of a sociopath , made all the more convincing by a compelling , perfectly judged turn from &name in the central role . 
^ sophisticated , daring and , unlike other &name adaptations , imbued with a deliciously dark wit , &name also displays a technical dexterity , making the most of &name 's superb score and &name &name 's luminous cinematography . 
^ trembling before g-d ( &num ) &num mins hebrew with english subtitles built around intimately-told personal stories of &name and orthodox jews who are gay or lesbian , trembling before g-d poignantly portrays a group of people who face a profound dilemma - how to reconcile their passionate love of judaism and the &name , with the drastic biblical prohibitions that forbids homosexuality . 
^ nominated for the grand jury prize at the &name &name &name and the winner of best documentary film at the &num &name &name &name , the film has sparked passionate debate between liberals and conservatives , gay rights activists , the media and organised religion spokespersons . 
^ the destructive results of the archaic advice given by learned rabbis and family heads to those interviewed is revealed in frequently heartbreaking detail and as such the film becomes a compelling portrait of the search for community , self-identity and acceptance . 
^ the heart of me ( &num ) , &num mins based on &name &name 's novel " the echoing &name " , the heart of me is an impeccable study of passion and its repression , set behind the closed doors ( and closed family ranks ) of society &name .

^ &char subversive love story of sorts , secretary charts the relationship which flourishes between a meticulous , control freak lawyer ( &name &name , crash ) and the woman he hires as his secretary ( &name &name , &name &name ) . 
^ she is the product of a dysfunctional family , a self harmer only recently released from a mental institution , who willingly surrenders herself to his explicitly dominant impulses . 
^ visually accomplished - &name creates a stylized hyper reality - what really elevates the intelligent , compelling material are the perfectly drawn characters , vividly realized by a trio of stand out performances , not least from &name , no stranger to playing characters with unusual sexual predilections .
