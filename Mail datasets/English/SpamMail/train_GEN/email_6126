^ dear &name , 
^ hi , i 'm &name &name , current &name computer secretary . 
^ &name &name has asked me to email you to ask whether you could serve as the &name computing secretary for the next year . 
^ to let you know what 's involved , here 's what i 've done for the last year : 
^ + updating the website . 
^ each term , update termcard . 
^ beginning of year update contact details . 
^ and then any other updates that need to happen . 
^ &website - &name ! 
^ &smiley 
^ + managing the email lists . 
^ &name has over &num email lists . 
^ along with the database secretary i manage them all . 
^ most are * not * directly our control since they are college group email lists and reps sort them out . 
^ we sort out the &name central &num . 
^ we tend to average about &num mailer-error a day ( ! ) mainly because of full inboxes ! 
^ all managing done through &name obviously . 
^ + &name event website . 
^ this was an * extra * this year and not necessarily the job of the &name secretary . 
^ depends who the &name ask to do it 
^ - obviously whoever they ask will need access to the webserver though . 
^ + &website domain . 
^ our domain name provider is &name ( &website . 
^ also control of subdomains , email forwarding etc. 
^ + recently i 've started work on a members sections for the website . 
^ this is so we can publish things that we might not want complete public access to , e.g. talk downloads , prayer points etc. i 'm not going to finish it this term but will probably continue writing it over the vac . 
^ i 'm currently working in &name and probably &name . 
^ + the webserver for the website is currently , as i expect you know , the &name . 
^ i see you have an account already so that makes things a little easier if you decide to take the job on . 
^ it sounds like a lot of work but it 's not really that bad . 
^ the termcard each term is quite a big job but it 's only &num page of html editing . 
^ all in all an enjoyable job , if you like computing ! 
^ and you have the power to change the lovely green colour on the &name website ! 
^ i think i 've got quite used to it . 
^ . 
^ . 
^ have a think and pray about whether you 'd like to do it and let me know if you have any further questions and your response . 
^ cheers , &name
