^ the parsed questions ( currently best version ) are in ques-out-jan29.rmrs 
^ &num parsed answer files are in rmrs / ans ( namely questions &num and &num ) . 
^ this data should be enough for your immediate testing needs -- please let me know if this is not the case . 
^ we are currently working on &char ) parsing all top_docs and &char ) the exact rmrs 's will also change in the final version . 
^ they will contain more information , but are already syntactically correct ( cf. the corresponding dtd ) .
