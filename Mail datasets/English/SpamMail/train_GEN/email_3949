^ at the moment my plans are to leave on the 17th , so you 'll probably have to stay with the &name 's your last couple of days here . 
^ but that 's good . 
^ you 'll get some variety that way &smiley 
^ now , you may be interesed to know about this ... i have an all day gathering here on saturday the 14th for what i suppose you might call my " &name coast &name &name club " , we call ourselves the unfinished projects group ( a group of folks who meet once a month to work on indian art projects or related works and have dinner together ) . 
^ as my official house guest from exotic lands you are certainly welcome to attend . 
^ quite an opportunity actually since our charter member is none other than &name &name himself , the world 's foremost authority on the subject . 
^ it 'll be a real feather in your cap to say that you 've had dinner with him , eh ? ? ? 
^ at least to your former teacher for whom you did that report ! 
^ okay &name , that 's all for now . 
^ keeping you in my prayers as requested !
