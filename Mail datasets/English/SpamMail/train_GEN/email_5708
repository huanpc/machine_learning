^ i did receive your &num files alright hte first time around . 
^ i only wanted to point out to you that in order to run your second &name file in a sensible way , you need input from my side , ie , how to run jetty . 
^ i will provide this info tomorrow or so . 
^ ( what i meant by send it to me , is your changed .jsp files , in case you have them , and in case you would like for me to test it with jetty . 
^ this is not required for the tick ! 
^ it 's an extra if you 're interested . 
^ so you should be all set . 
^ best ,
