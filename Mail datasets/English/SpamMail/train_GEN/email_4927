^ hi all , 
^ there are some issues that we all need to talk about before the next phase of implementation begins in full swing . 
^ we 're generating a list of such issues , which so far includes things like stream &name 's ( how big are they ? 
^ what is their type ? 
^ what is there position in the tuple ? 
^ when are they being generated etc. ) and type inferencing . 
^ i would have liked to meet this week , but the &name paper looks like it 's going to make that impossible . 
^ given that it will have to be next week , we might as well wait and meet before the next &name meeting , which is currently scheduled for wed at &num at &name . 
^ so my question is , could all of the &name people make it to &name prior to the &name meeting ( say , at &num : &num ) for this meeting ? 
^ please let me know . 
^ - &name
