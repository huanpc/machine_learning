^ " perhaps they [ guys ] need to communicate more frequently , but wo n't. ^ - surely we 're not that stupid ! ? ^ i understand the need to try and solve the problem . ^ i also understand the release gained by sharing your troubles with someone else . ^ " a venusian ( woman ! ) feels good about herself when she has loving friends with whom to share her feelings and problems . ^  har  ame ( man ! ) feels good when he can solve his problems on his own in his cave . ^ - i think i disagree with this . ^ surely both men and women alike feel good when they have loving friends with whom to share their feelings and problems ? ^ why , how could marriage work if  um party decided they could solve all their problems on their own ? ^ " it 's difficult to tell with e-mail exactly how you express things ^ - as the  ame library  ame warned . ^ ( remember that one ? ? ! ! ) ^ - okay , it was the  ame its guide to  ame , and not only do i remember it i can call it up . ^ excerpt from e-mail dated 6th july  um , to  ame , from  ame ^ " i will end with the following quote from the its booklet " computing at  ame . ^ do n't tell me you have n't read it ! ^ i 'm amazed ! ^ utterly confounded ! ^ bemused , confused , and finally , shocked ! ^ section  um ; ^ " never forget that the person on the other end is human " it is easy to misinterpret a message without the voice inflections of face-to-face communication . ^ i agree . ^ e-mail is sometimes a difficult medium for communicating through . ^ " i 'm going to incur the wrath of  ame in saying that . ^ however , i 'm not scared , coz he 's not  ame . ^ - you will incur the wrath of  ame ? ! ^ i think i already have ! ! ^ he now communicates with me only through his lawyer , a 'mr  ame . ^ this is the last e-mail i received from him ^  ame  ame esq. , ^ as mr.  ame 's lawyer , i assure you that you are , how shall i put it in the soup . ^ frankly , you are a very unwise young man to have crossed my client . ^ you have dealt in an immature manner , and will be dealt with accordingly . ^ you may be assured that you will be sued to the full extent of the law , and will probably never see your homeland again . ^ ( you can expect to be deported as a slave to  ame . ) ^ oh yes , mr.  ame , you have played with fire , and now you 're going to get burned ( or burrrrrrrrned , as you would say ) . ^ you have unfortunately messed with one of the most important personages in the country ( in the form of my client ) , and i do n't get paid  ound;  um an hour to fool around in other words , your life as you know it is about to be terminated . ^ so there 's the good news mr.  ame . ^ the bad news is that my people ( thugs / mercenaries some might call them ) will be round shortly to un-tuck your bed-sheet . ^ yes it 's true mr.  ame , i 'm afraid there is no easy way to break this kind of news . ^ so , until we meet face to face ( probably in the dock ) let me wish you a happy future . ^ sincerely , ^ mr.  ame ^ well ! ^ how do you like that ! ? ^ i got that communication directly before i went to bed , so i was nervously looking around for the thugs / mercenaries who were dispatched to un-tuck my bed-sheets ! ^ ( perhaps you are unaware of the origins of this " un-tuck joke . ^ you see ,  um night i was just settling down to a good night 's rest when  ame banged on my door . ^ i was reluctant to let him in as i was tired , but he would not take no for an answer . ^ when i entered my room he immediately called  ame and the  um of them spent the next  um minutes laughing at the way in which my duvet still looked perfect even when i was in my bed . ^ they also laughed in amazement at how my pillowcase was as un-creased as normal even with my head on it . ^ they then took great delight in messing up my bed-clothes and messing up my hair . ^ i was slightly nonplussed , to say the least . ) ^ " what are you hatching up ? ? ? ^ i want to know ! ! ! ! ^ - i am unsure as yet , but i have some ideas . ^ " lots of shopping . ^  ame ! ^ - do you actually enjoy shopping ? ^ why ? ^ " was that the one which you 'strategically passed by answering only  um ( or something like that ) of the paper ? ? ^ - yes . ^ " we had a power cut . ^ - oh ! ! ^ how perfectly delightful ! ^ you are fortunate ! ^ it 's kind of unfair though you see , we move from a little village of a few hundred people to an isolated hamlet / farm with only about  um people because we expect there to be more opportunities for power cuts out in the country , rather than in a village . ^ then what happens ? ! ^ there have n't been any in the last year ! ^ whilst you on the other hand , living in a sprawling metropolis of a city , have a  um hour power cut ! ^ talk about unfair ! ! ! ^ i 'm quite jealous ! ^ "  ame makes you realise how much our everyday activities depend upon electricity . ^ - well , it does n't sound like you were able to do much without electricity ! ^ do n't you have a little gas-powered stove to make hot chocolate during emergency power-cuts ? ^ do n't you have a real fire to heat your house when the electricity is unavailable ? ^ we do , but then , we almost bought a portable electrical generator for power-cuts , but we decided not to . ^ we like to be prepared. ( ! ) ^ "  ame and i went to the cinema to see "  ame 's angels . ^ - my dad and brother are going to see that in  ame tomorrow amongst other things . ^ 'does it not amaze you how such colossal hunks of machinery ( stuffed full of mechanical parts , people and their luggage ) can get off the ground and  ame ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ^ - yes , but it amazes me more how such tiny things like birds can fly . ^ " i still have n't done any uni work . ^ - do you have collections ? ^ " i 've never been to a funeral before . ^ my dad 's been asked to do it too . ^ can you imagine doing your on mother 's funeral ? ^ - funerals are quite strange . ^ no , i ca n't imagine doing my own mother 's funeral . ^ does he really want to do it ? ^ " has anything arrived for you in the post yet ? ^ - yes ! ^ it arrived yesterday ! ^ thanks soooo much ! ^ the holographic doctor picture is soooooooo cool ! ^ ( it 's going up on my door next term ! ) also , the  ame  ame  um stuff is really useful all the pictures i wanted are there ! ^ thanks very much  ame ! ^ also , thanks for the address list . ^ i will return the items you wish back at the beginning of next term . ^ 'my fish fingers and chips are ready . ^ - do you know what they 're really made from ? ^ (  ame and potatoes . ) ^ well , hope you are having a good time  ame . ^ see you , ^  ame</text_normal></message_body></message>
