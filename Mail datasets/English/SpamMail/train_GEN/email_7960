^ here 's a challenge for ya . 
^ in case you did n't know ( i.e. if you were n't attacked by a huge fuck-off spider recently - ha ha ) theni was in &name last weekend and saw this irish band ( who were actually from &name scotia ) in a pub . 
^ anyway , they played the unicorn song , come on now , you remember the unicorn song do n't you ? 
^ it was on that tape &name made up for us when we were ickle . 
^ there was also sneaky snake which was my personal favourite it has to be said . 
^ when i was speaking to moary we remembered that the rivers of &name was on it as well , and i think puff the magic dragon was also on it . 
^ so the mission people , is to try and remember the other says on the tape , cuz it 's annoying me and &char want to know .
