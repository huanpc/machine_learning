^ hi &name ! 
^ in the present-tential form of the words of the terminator " i 'm back . " 
^ yes , it certainly was a tiring week , and last night i was absolutely exhausted . 
^ i think one of the hardest things about the camp was the incessant noise . 
^ i was leader of &num boys and they were just so noisy all the time . 
^ i thought my brain was going to explode . 
^ still , at least after the first night they quietened down for sleep without too much arm-twisting . 
^ yes , i acquired a number of femal fans during the week and i am now being bombarded with text messages by one of them - oh well . 
^ i now have &name staying with me , and we will probably attempt to do some shopping today ( do n't tell &name ! ) . 
^ i wonder if the shops in &name are open on sunday . 
^ life is crazy is n't it - i wonder what it 's all about . 
^ also , i wish that i was better at being myself all the time - then life would be less tiring ( sometimes ) . 
^ it sounds like you are being a good chemistry student , so good for you . 
^ &name sunscreen , 
^ &name

^ dear &name , 
^ hello . 
^ what was children 's camp like ? 
^ were you the subject of adoration for multiple teenage girls this time ? 
^ hope you enjoyed it . 
^ are you still living in &name ? 
^ i 've had thursday and friday off work since the harvest has been slow in starting and there was literally nothing for me to do - all painting and tidying completed . 
^ therefore i 've been spending my time doing some chemistry . 
^ last weekend i spend a lovely few days at &name 's house . 
^ she ate &num slices of pizza on monday lunchtime at pizza hut and felt rather ill afterwards . 
^ dear , oh dear . 
^ i consumed a much more respectable &num . 
^ after eating &num once with &name i decided not to attempt a repeat performance . 
^ yesterday morning i went for a walk on the beach which we all went to when the flat came to visit &name . 
^ it was gloriously sunny and most enjoyable , although i could n't see any remains from our forbidden campfire . 
^ bye , 
^ &name
