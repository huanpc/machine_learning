^ &name , 
^ 'my friend , vhat are i doing ? " 
^ - i could ask you the same question , but judging from your peculiar patterns of speech the answer would not be very illuminating . 
^ " &num hannant heard from &char for many dazs naa , an &char 's a wonnering if you 's ok ? " 
^ - yes , i 'm perfectly functionary , but now i must address the later section of the question to you . 
^ are you feeling okay ? 
^ is the sun getting to you ? 
^ " &name hanging in zee olde scot 's land ? " 
^ - &name , does that mean who is , i.e. wha' is . 
^ i presume so . 
^ therefore i feel that i am at a loss for words , since &num million ( a guess ) people is probably an accurate answer , but i am in no position to name them all correctly . 
^ " &name still 's remembers zee time we 's a spended in yer hous . 
^ &name . " 
^ - yes , i really enjoyed that weekend . 
^ it was great ! 
^ so &name , you have now finished your mapping project ( fieldwork anyway - i suppose you still have some written stuff left to do ? ) and have spent a week in &name . 
^ congratulations ! 
^ i hope you have a really great holiday with your family in &name . 
^ i 'm off to camp on saturday for a week . 
^ i 'm a bit worried as i will be leading an " enquirer 's group " for the children , so please pray about that . 
^ i 've been quite busy lately with chemistry . 
^ what have you been encountering this week in the way of &name , academic work , fun , or anything else ? 
^ i have been spending most of the last week writing my dissertation . 
^ i have now completed a rough draft , which ( thankfully ) my supervisor is " pleasantly surprised " with 
^ - i 'm not quite sure how to take that ! 
^ anyway , i have also been finishing my stone circle in our garden , and my dad is going to plant a tree in it next week . 
^ apart from that , i have been indulging in lazy mornings and late nights . 
^ very bad and undisciplined ! 
^ well , i certainly had a busy day today ! 
^ i got up at &num o' clock and caught a train to &name at &num : &num . 
^ after alighting at &name station i promptly made my way to the library . 
^ there i worked ( toil such as only &name would understand ) until &num : &num , after which i felt within me prognostics of hunger pangs . 
^ henceforth i skipped gaily along to &name 's restaurant of fine foods and procured a high quality lunch . 
^ late as it was , the time delay only heightened my appreciation of sumptuous chicken pieces delicately fried in the purest olive oil you know , &name only have a bad reputation due to the senior management 's most effective scaremongering tactics . 
^ if everyone realised how akin to &name their delectable morsels were the chief executives would have no where to eat out for dinner . 
^ very best wishes , 
^ &name 
^ &name i 'm still lost on the accent ! 
^ - which one is it ?
