^ as it happens , i 've been looking for some kind of recording software for my mac . 
^ however no luck so far . 
^ my initial ( conservative ! ) reaction would be that it takes quite a lot of work to do such a thing well ... however i particularly like the idea for posterity 's sake . 
^ it will be fun in &num years time to dig out the old &name player and listen to alternative christmas carols as performed by the &name : 
^ &name : the first &name : shearer , &num min ( pen ) &name : the &name &name &name ( &name pa pum &name 's) &name : &char &name town of &name ( why do n't you have a cinema ? ) 
^ i 'll have a think about this and get back to you . 
^ &name

^ hello . 
^ i am alive and well , you will be pleased to hear . 
^ i am missing &name quite a lot , and she is missing me even more , which is not very good . 
^ other than that . ... 
^ i was thinking that as we have been given a limit on amount of money to be spent this christmas , what we ( &name , &name and &char ) can do for people is make some &name 's of us playing music ? 
^ like christmas carols or other pieces ? 
^ i do n't know , what do you think ? 
^ do you think that you ( &name ) could download some multitrack / multiband recording software for either the &name or our comuper at home ? 
^ hope you are both well ! 
^ &name 
^ do you &name ! ? 
^ everything you 'll ever need on &num web page from news and sport to email and music charts &website
