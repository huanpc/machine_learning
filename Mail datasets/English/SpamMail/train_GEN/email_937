^ hi &name , 
^ i listened to your voicemail - let 's just say it 's not the kind of greeting i 'd have on my phone . 
^ anyway , i remembered a conversation between &name and myself last term and thought i 'd mention it to you . 
^ we were thinking about making a cd after the exams - what do you think of this ? 
^ obviously we 'd need to use your recording equipment . 
^ well , it might not happen but it 's an idea anyway . 
^ see you in a few days . 
^ &name
