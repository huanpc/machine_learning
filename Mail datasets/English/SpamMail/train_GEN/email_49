^ &name : experiments on the automatic induction of german verb classes 
^ speaker : &name &name &name &name - university of &name 
^ &name : 
^ the verb is central to the structure and the meaning of a sentence , so available lexical resources on verb knowledge represent an important means for natural language processing applications . 
^ this talk focuses on the automatic induction of verb classes : a clustering methodology is developed which utilises the relationship between verb meaning components and verb behaviour to provide a classification of german verbs . 
^ in the first part of the talk , i describe the acquisition of lexical syntactic and semantic verb properties from an unsupervised trained statistical grammar model . 
^ the properties are used to define german verbs on &num levels of verb description , purely syntactic frame types , prepositional phrase information and selectional preferences . 
^ in the second part of the talk , i describe the adjustment of the standard clustering algorithm k-means to the task of inducing semantic verb classes from the various verb descriptions . 
^ the clustering parameters , clustering evaluation and clustering results are interpreted and discussed .
