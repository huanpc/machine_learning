^ hi &name , 
^ hope you had a good christmas , new year etc. mine was good . 
^ i was at my friends " in &name for new year . 
^ i also saw lots of my godchildren over christmas , but did n't go through the religious significance of the season with them - i did n't think it was worth it since neither of them can talk or understand very much . 
^ so now it 's back to normal with life at &name 's ( obviously i use the term " normal " very loosely ... ) . 
^ my timetable has changed for the worse and i now have &num and a half hours a week . 
^ &num and a half of those are concentrated on a tuesday , so you can imagine how exhausted i will be by the end of today . 
^ how 's the &name 's posse who relocated to &name ? 
^ anyway , i 'm writing really to ask if you 'd do me a favour . 
^ there 's a journal article that i really need for my dissertation from a journal that they have in the &name university library . 
^ i put in an inter-library request for it at the beginning of november and still have n't had it . 
^ every time i go to the library to ask about it they tell me they 'll look into it and get back to me , but they never do , so i was wondering if i gave you the details , would you be so kind as to photocopy it / scan it / post it / email it / whatever . 
^ so if you get a chance , the journal is , american catholic philosophical quarterly , &num ; &num ( &name ) . 
^ the article is by &name &name , is called " the &name &name and the limits of philosophical theodicy " and is on pages &num . 
^ i would be eternally grateful and would tell everyone i meet what a wonderful example of human being you are . 
^ or something like that . 
^ &name . 
^ &name .
