^ hey &name , 
^ thanks for the email ! 
^ lovely to hear from you . 
^ i am so sorry that you did n't get the &name you went for - but it is nice and refreshing to hear your positive response . 
^ that is the attitude i have adopted ( and am striving to maintain ! ) with regards to what i do from here onwards . 
^ i have handed my notice in at &name having got fed up with the way things are at this place . 
^ they pay peanuts and give very little recognition for my efforts . 
^ oh well , time to get out . 
^ i do n't have anything lined up at present but have been applying for lots of jobs and have another interview on monday ( i really want this job - working for a christian organisation doing what i do best - organising things and marketing ! 
^ cool ! ! 
^ however , i have to trust that if i do n't get it then that is what is right . 
^ same as the whole me and &name thing . 
^ i hate what has happened so much but an searching for the sense in it and trying to better myself as a result of it . 
^ i still want him back and , if truth be told , part of my wanting to staty in &name is to do just that ... but we 'll wait on &name and see . 
^ &name , nearly 9am so had better sign off . 
^ be assured that you are often in my thoughts and prayers &smiley please pray for me too ( i 'm sure you do ) and also for &name and &name at present . 
^ his treatment has ended ( nothing more they can do ) and &name has given up work to spend time with him . 
^ they are going to the lake district a lot at present as &name wants to make the most of things while he still can . 
^ the doctors reckon that the next month will be crucial to indicating just how quickly things will get worse . 
^ the are amazing though , truely amazing and an example to anyone suffering or struggling with the whole &name why ? ? ? ? ? 
^ question . 
^ oh , better go now , take care and be in touch again soon , love &name &smiley

^ from : " &name &name " ( &email ) to : " &name &name " ( &email ) subject : re : &name : wed , &num &name &num &num : &num : &num &num 
^ dear &name , 
^ thanks for your e-mail , and sorry it has been so long in getting back to you , i 've been away from my e-mail for ages . 
^ i am sorry your future seems so uncertain . 
^ i know something of what that feels like , thought probably not to the extent that you feel it . 
^ i hope you get some inclination of what to do next year . 
^ i had an interview in &name for the &name that i did n't get last year , and have n't heard back from them yet , which makes me think that i have n't got it . 
^ &name does know best though , and so i am trying not to worry about it . 
^ it would be nice to knwo what was happening though . 
^ i feel like i would like to be all sorted out , with a life and a job and just be able to know who i am . 
^ yet those things should n't make me what i am . 
^ surely , knowing that i am a beloved child of the lord most high , this should be all the identity that i need . 
^ how far i have slipped ! 
^ perhaps then it is the security that i desire that makes me chase after a job , or &name ? 
^ but again , has n't &name said that he will provide for us ? 
^ sometimes i wonder at myself . 
^ i have been in with &name the last week and a bit , and it has been very good . 
^ it was wonderful to actually be able to spend some time with her , more than the weekend jaunts up to &name . 
^ even so , as i was with her family , &name and i did n't get much time on our own , which was a bit of a downer . 
^ please pray for us , that we may be able to get through the horrible year of not seeing much of each other . 
^ i find it hard , and i know that &name finds it even harder . 
^ your prayers would be appreciated . 
^ i shall pray that your future becomes more clear , and that you will trust &name with everything . 
^ &name bless you , and i hope your &name is wonderful . 
^ &name
