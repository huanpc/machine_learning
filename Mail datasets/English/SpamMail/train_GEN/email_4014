^ i 'd go with mono-syllabic myself . 
^ and i think it 's the english language that 's being mutilated rather than &name 's voice box . 
^ or perhaps he 's gradually frying the neuronic connections that supply him with information on how to form words . ...

^ of course i take offence at what you say . 
^ it really is silly to say offensive things and then expect people not to mind just be cause you say 'do n't take offence " at the end . 
^ are people not allowed to be in bad moods occasionally ? 
^ as far as i am aware we are meant to show our feelings . 
^ why bottle things up ? 
^ let 's " be honest " with everyone . 
^ oh , and contrary to all that you might think i do not find booking the video room difficult - just tedious and unnecessary as ( &char ) i dislike the place intensely and ( &char ) i have no need to book it when you &num can . 
^ and &name - i 'm sorry i asked you to reply to emails . 
^ i 'd forgotten that such replies normally take the form of incomprehensible multi-syllabic guttural mutilations of your voice box .

^ someone arrange to book the video room or find a video recorder because frankly i ca n't be bothered and am fed up with the whole thing . 
^ &name - if this does n't suit then you should have replied . 
^ let me know what time it 's being watched at and you can have the video . 
^ who knows , i might even watch it myself if i feel like it .
