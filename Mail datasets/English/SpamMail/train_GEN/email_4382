^ i think i should clarify . 
^ the room has the option of red , green , yellow and blue lighting depending on &num mood . 
^ flick the switch and the scene is set . 
^ quite groovy , and i believe , quite &name &name . 
^ secondly , &name , i 've met women in the past with names such as &name and ( funnily enough ) &name . 
^ they seemed perfectly happy with such titles so i 'm sure you 'll warm to it . 
^ why do i get the impression i 'm digging a big hole for myself ?

^ so is it that your going to &name or not depends upon the current colour of the hotel room or is it that you 're going to put your engineering skills to good use and go and fix this obvisously faulty button ( and what 's the role of &name in all this ) ?

^ oh dear . 
^ i did n't think we were going to be quite so vocal about our arrangements , &name . 
^ &name , i 'd love to come but there 's obviously the hotel issue to sort out first . 
^ apparently the room can change colour at the push of a button . 
^ i 'm very excited . 
^ love &name xx ( in the spirit of taking names of the opposite sex . 
^ p.s. why do girls of university age do that ? )
