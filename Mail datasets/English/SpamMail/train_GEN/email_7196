^ hi &name , hope you 're ok and getting enough rest- even more importantly , that you 're getting plenty of time to pray and feed on &name 's word &smiley ticket-selling was fairly quiet again today , but some were sold ... i 'm afraid i could n't quite work out what it is that we 're recording on the card with " cash " and " tickets left " ? 
^ i 'm assuming " tickets left " does n't mean " total number of tickets still to be sold " ? 
^ &name came in with some more money and tickets left over from ticket-selling , but at that stage we 'd only just arrived and i had n't seen that card to fill in , so did n't think to ask ... as for " cash' - does that mean total income for the day , or the amount of cash in the box ? 
^ i have the card here to fill in when i know how , i could drop it off this evening to whoever needs it for tomorrow . 
^ do n't worry , i 've made a note of the tickets sold , their numbers and types , and the fact that they 've been paid for . 
^ i 've also taken a few to sell at the &name &name &name group tomorrow , i 'll record these carefully and take the money and any remaining tickets to the &name , where i 'm on ticket-sales anyway . 
^ hope that 's all ok , sorry my confusion . 
^ see you thursday , if not before , love &name ps if you meet people in the p' lodge on thursday , i 'll stay in my room so that if anyone makes their own way there , it wo n't be empty &smiley thanks !
