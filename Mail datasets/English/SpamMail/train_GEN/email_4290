^ major ! ! ! 
^ &name stuff . 
^ &name &name - hmmmm . 
^ never sounds as good as the real thing . 
^ i think you can get some pretty good plucking effects , and actually some of the programming i 've heard is pretty cool , but for the serous solo stuff i really think you still have to have the strings . 
^ anyway - &name - my friend uses logic platinum , and he likes it . 
^ i used to use micrologic , which is a scaled-down version of logic - nice programs . 
^ i heard through the grapevine that you and i were up in &name for a couple of days ( i happened to be reading the daily mirror that day . ) . 
^ i 'm going up for the weekend of the 30th nov for &name 's 21st birthday . 
^ i really ca n't wait ! 
^ it 's funny really , just hearing you say that they 've re-done the &name room makes me feel sort-of jealous , like " they should n't have done something like that without me there ! " . 
^ silly really but there you go . 
^ did you see &name ? 
^ i 'm still waiting for an email from him ! 
^ either he hates me , or he 's really busy . 
^ &smiley 
^ the other day , someone pinched my bike lights while i was in &name . 
^ well , either that or someone in &name stole them which is possible but unlikely ( i hope ! ) . 
^ and then , today , someone stole my trouser clips of all things ! ! ! 
^ what is the flipping world coming to ? 
^ well , i had to go the bike shop and buy all the accessories again - bummer ! 
^ we played our second match the other day against &name college and beat them &num . 
^ i was playing at left-back ! ! ! 
^ quite a new experience for me . 
^ we played pretty well and the morale is much higher now . 
^ we 've got a new goalie now who is really excellent - he 's the college groundsman ! 
^ we were supposed to be playing a cup match today but it was cancelled due to a waterlogged pitch ( which probably still brings you out in a cold sweat ! ) . 
^ anyway , keep it real , and i 'll speak to you later , 
^ &name

^ hey &name ! 
^ how are things ? 
^ im taking some time out of what has been a mad rush of a day , to email ! 
^ you know when you suddenly think of a hundred and &num things that you should have done all at once . . ... that was my morning ! 
^ i managed to get the train in time for my first lecture so that is the main thing ! ! 
^ i am learning to use logic at the moment which is good fun . 
^ our tutor was showing us how to get a good guitar sound by just using &name but i was a bit synical ! 
^ it sounded fairly convincing but not great on the widdly solos ! 
^ anyway , i am back into the course after my 'reading " week ( i did n't do much reading but nevermind ! ) . 
^ &name and i went up to &name for a couple of days which was cool ! 
^ it has n't changed very much ( except the &name room has had a dramatic make over ) . 
^ it was great to see everyone up there . 
^ they all seemed happy ! 
^ it is strange but at times i could have easily believed that i was still there myself . ... it did n't take long to settle back into things ! 
^ how 's the workload mate ? 
^ are you still busy ? 
^ how about the football ? 
^ i went down to watch the &name " &name team play and that was good ! 
^ i think they are doing ok because they won &num ! 
^ the &char 's sound like they are doing pretty well but do n't have that many freshers . 
^ apparently there is a good centre back so atleast they have found a replacement for their captain ! 
^ anyway , &name just realised that i am telling you all this and im sure you know because of your brother ! ! ! 
^ &name , i wont delete it , it can jsut adds to my wierd day ! 
^ i hope things are going well mate , 
^ take care
