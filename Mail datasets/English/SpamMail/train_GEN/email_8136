^ &name people , 
^ i think i have all the right addresses for everyone , and have n't missed anyone off the list , but please shout at me if i 've got it wrong . 
^ to clarify , all &name &name compscis should be getting this ... 
^ okay , so ... we are the &name &name compscis . 
^ i 'm hoping we should all have met each other by now , but just in case i 'll summarise . 
^ we have : 
^ &name and &name - part &name &num &name - part &name &num &name - part &name &name - part &num &name - &name &name - &name 
^ if anyone has any name preferences i 've neglected , now would be a good time to make them known . 
^ &smiley 
^ i thought it might be a good idea for us all to get together and ... do something ... sometime . 
^ not to be too vague &smiley last year we managed to wangle a ( free ! ) subject dinner from college with the help of &name &name , who 's the nearest thing we have to a &name fellow here . 
^ if everyone is amenable , i can get in touch with &name and see if we can get a similar ball rolling this year . 
^ please email me with your thoughts on this , whether it 's a " yes please " or " no thank you' . 
^ in the mean time , we all have an invitation to &name " formal hall every &name . 
^ i suggest we * all * sign up &num particular week to give us a chance to mingle a bit more than we ( or is it just i ? ) have managed so far . 
^ and show up the &name " compscis , of course ... &smiley how does next wednesday sound to everyone ? 
^ please &name ! 
^ see yous , 
^ &name
