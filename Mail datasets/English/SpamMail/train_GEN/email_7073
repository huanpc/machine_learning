^ hello &name ! 
^ hope you 're all having a great summer vac , sorry to those of you who are n't 
^ checking your email and wo n't get this till you return to &name &name 
^ ( &name ? 
^ well its not in &name anyway ! 
^ who 's got all the sun ? ) 
^ here i am with some stuff to keep you entertained ... a summary of what we 
^ talked about at the last &name meetings ( cast your memories back ... ) - this is mainly for those of you who were n't able to make it along , but thought it might be helpful for others . 
^ yahay ! 
^ here goes ... 
^ at the link meetings we were talking about welcoming international freshers 
^ in october . 
^ there will no opportunity quite like freshers week for making 
^ friends with international students , and is a time when we can particularly 
^ be a help to them . 
^ we thought through some ideas under these headings ... 
^ making &name some ideas for making contact with international freshers included 
^ - getting hold of names and addresses from college authorities / &name committee and writing to int freshers coming up , introducing yourself and 
^ even giving them an opportunity to reply and let you know when they 're arriving so you can go say hi . 
^ might be a bit late for organising that by 
^ now though85 
^ - if addresses are n't allowed , then just getting hold of a list of names &char &char you can make contact once in &name 
^ - the international student welcome that meets international students arriving at bus train stations and offers to visit and see how students are 
^ getting on and help out will be passing on to me all names of undergrads who request visits . 
^ i will pass these names onto you so that you or people 
^ in your college groups can go visit these students . 
^ - if all else fails , just go along to freshers events being put on in your 
^ college to meet people , introducing yourself to international students and 
^ getting to know them there ! 
^ visiting85 us brits think that going round knocking on doors is an invasio &char of privacy , but do n't worry , its entirely appropriate . 
^ a visit and chance 
^ to chat might be really appreciated by some international students , as people often wo n't be taking the initiative to do this . 
^ stay and chat as long as you 're welcome , see if there 's any way you can 
^ help them out , and invite them round for tea or &name and tell them 
^ about &name ( you should have fliers by then ) 
^ what might be the needs of &name &name ? 
^ how can we help out ? 
^ have a good 
^ think about this one85 shopping , subject stuff , general where to be when , 
^ emailing , postoffices , banks . 
^ if someone wants to know where something is , 
^ its great to be able to offer to take them there , rather than just giving 
^ directions . 
^ putting on &name or &name . 
^ remember kiss ( keep it simple stupid ! ) 
^ informal and personal works best . 
^ invite people round to tea or breakfast 
^ or something like that , hosted by some of the college group . 
^ this is a great opportunity to get to know each other , so that friendships can be built . 
^ amid all the scary freshers stuff going on in college , something small scale where int freshers can just have a chance to chat and get to know a few people could be perfect ! 
^ inviting to globe 
^ do n't let anyone miss out on this one ! 
^ let all the international freshers 
^ ( and non freshers if poss ! ) know about &name . 
^ there will be some fliers for 
^ you by freshers week . 
^ it is very informal and relaxed and friendly so don " &char be scared about inviting people to it . 
^ the short gospel epilogue towards the end introduces &name in a really relaxed way , so you do n't need to worry if people have never thought about christianity at all ever before . 
^ &name will be having a special freshers week night that you can invite people to . 
^ enthusing the college group 
^ this is really important . 
^ please do n't try to go it alone ! 
^ you guys are 
^ here to encourage all your group in not forgetting international students 
^ in their evangelism to those around them . 
^ try to get some others on board 
^ in helping you in what you do during freshers week . 
^ maybe explain to the college group at some point why you are making a special effort to reach out to international students85 [ &name , because as we seek to present th i gospel to students in &name , international students will tend to get neglected . 
^ secondly , because this is particularly urgent and strategic evangelism . 
^ &name has brought people from all over the world to this university , and for many of them , this time in &name may be the only opportunity they have to hear about &name , and after &num years they will 
^ return to live and work in nations right across the globe . ] think how you 
^ can make use of the houseparty in encouraging your college group to think 
^ about outreach to international students , especially during freshers week , 
^ and to be praying too . 
^ christian international freshers just a thought85 will our college groups be welcoming to christian international students who come along ? 
^ we seek to bring the gospel to all people because it is for people of all nations . 
^ &name our brothers and sisters from all nations feel welcome at our college 
^ group meetings ? 
^ so as well as welcoming non christian freshers , lets look 
^ to be welcoming christian international freshers , encouraging them to be involved in the college group , and helping them out in settling in churches . 
^ &name , hope all that is some help . 
^ &name what a privilege it is for us to be 
^ able to get to know people from all over &name 's world and introduce his son 
^ &name to them ! 
^ lets pray that &name will be graciously revealing himself to 
^ many from all nations in &name this year ! 
^ just to let you know , some ideas on how to use international slots in college group meetings each week next term will also be coming your way . 
^ and please do n't hesitate to get in touch with me at any point about anything , love &name xxx
