^ salve amici ! ! 
^ i trust you 're all fine and &name , as well as being exteremely busy with work , plays , football , climbing ( that 's just for you , &name ! ) and lots of nearly-end-of- term-christmas socialising ! 
^ ( apologies to you fellow abroad peops , who are probably not doing any of those things ... ! ) i know it 's been a couple of weeks since &char last emailed , it 's been all go here , with a whirlwind of revision ( yes , it did happen , it 's not a typing error ! ) last week for my exam . 
^ i suddenly realised on monday that i did n't know anything about futurism , or anything else before or after it . 
^ and i had to speak in italian - nice one ! 
^ did n't have a clue what to expect and thought we might have to do a presentation or just have a chat . 
^ it ended up being a chat with the lecturer , who 's really nice . 
^ all i had to do was talk a bit about my favourite paintings and then tell her about &name . 
^ a really tough exam ! 
^ somehow &char came out with &num / &num - &char reckon she just made up a mark and gave it to me , &char hardly knew anything ! ! 
^ so anyway after that exam stress ( ! ) , decided we had to celebrate our results , and on monday , &name , &name and i went to &name . 
^ took a long time to get there by bus , train and tram but found the hostel quickly and walked along the sea front which was lit up . 
^ was told that the city is n't very nice but it 's still somewhere you have to go to ! 
^ i did n't think it was that bad , but there are lots of other prettier cities here , so i can understand what they mean . 
^ the next day we went to &name , which is more like a resort , and a place where celebraties go ( lots of yachts and posh hotels , darling ! ) i loved it there . 
^ was really relaxing , after the caos of &name ! 
^ now i 'm back here for a bit . 
^ then i 'm going to watch &name play inter , at &name next week . 
^ am meeting up with &name &name and some friends to watch the second leg . 
^ ( we won &num last time ! ! ) and there ends the exciting update on what i 'm up to ! ! 
^ but the main reason i 'm emailing , is to say that the new year 's party is still on . 
^ if you all want to come , it is ... ! ! 
^ at the moment , i do n't have a clue about any details , that can wait til nearer the time . 
^ but i would love to see you all and for it to go ahead . 
^ some of you , i have n't seen since july - how long is that ! 
^ &name and &name are probably going to &name 's party instead , but are hoping to make it to my house on new year 's day , so hopefully we could make it into a &num day thing , so that &name can see everyone as well ! 
^ also please feel free to invite anyone , especially as i did n't have everyone 's email addresses , both in our year and other years . 
^ just thought i 'd better email you all now , while you 're still at college . 
^ looking forward to hear from everyone ! 
^ lots of love &name get your free download of &name explorer at &website
