^ hi dad , &name , 
^ some thoughts on the canoe trip . 
^ &name , i 'm sending in another email the map of &name for your perusal . 
^ i assume we 're doing a &num night / &num day jaunt . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - entrance &num ( &name lake ) is south-east . 
^ not bad , but somewhat limited in how far we can go without hitting some big portages . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i agree with &name , it does n't look too bad . 
^ a loop with a day trip is often good , this does n't look like it would push us too much . 
^ &num potential problem is that there are n't many campsites on this route . 
^ day &num : &name ( good paddling , no portages ) &name &num : &name &name &num : &name ( &num longish portages , with not much paddling , this is the downer of the route ) &name &num : &name &name &num : &name &name &name ( should be feasible , but quite long ) &name &num : &name &name &num : &name ( another long portage ) 
^ &char little uninspiring perhaps ... 
</text_normal>

^ 
^ - we could do &name lake entry again , but head south out of &name .. looking at the map we could go to &name on the first day - only &num portage ( but it is 1.8k ) . 
^ then islet on day &num and &num ( &num portages to get there , but shorter - &num less than &num , &num about &num ) . 
^ on the second day we could do a day trip , or do a backpacking trip since we would be close to the backpack trail . , then a &num and &num back to &name lake ( we do a loop ) . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i like the idea , although i 'm not sure how far we 'd get into the interior proper . 
^ with backpackers etc. this could be a bit less isolated than normal . 
^ also i wonder whether doing this the other way round might be good , to put the big portage at the end after we 've done a few ? 
</text_normal>

^ 
^ - we could do just a backpacking run out of &name lake ( &name has done this with his camping ) . 
^ ( advantage of no canoe rental . ) 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - we could enter at the enrance above &name ( &name / butt ) and design a route through there . 
^ i think you have been there before . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &char great idea , our magnettawan-hambone-butt-queer-little &name &name route was great fun . 
^ the &num big portage ( &num km ) is the only downside , but if we 're up for this then great ! 
^ good paddling all the way , plus variety ( big lake , small lake river ) and &name &name is a bonus . 
^ we 've done it before but it was good . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ 
^ - we could go south off of highway &num . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i had a look , there 's a nice loop off &name lake with lots of little portages , something could be made to work there . 
^ perhaps a bit too challenging ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ give me some thoughts . 
^ i am sending in a separate e-mail an &name version of the algonquin map for you to look at . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ how about 
^ day &num : &name &name &num : &name ( i think where we camped the first time , with the gray &name ! ) &name &num : &name &name ( this is ambitious , but no long portages ) &name &num : &name &name &num : &name &name ( i doubt &name &name gets many visitors ... ) &name &num : &name &name &num : &name ( &num long portages , but we could split them and have lunch on &name ) 
^ this has a combination of new stuff and old favourites . 
^ i tried to fit &name &name into this route , but could n't. 
^ if you can think of a way then let me know ! 
^ well , there are my thoughts . 
^ i reckon a challenging trip is more rewarding , but perhaps less relaxing ! 
^ love , 
^ &name
