^ hi , as someone posted on the &name maker forum the latest virus definition file of &name &name says that all executables generated with &name maker have &website / dr virus . 
^ it is not the first time &name definitions detect suspecious code in regular software . 
^ i guess that you will get several requests on that subject in the next hours . 
^ i will try to address the problem with &name support if possible . 
^ regards , &name .
