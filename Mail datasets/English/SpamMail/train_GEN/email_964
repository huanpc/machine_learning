^ &name fabulous friends . 
^ i have never done a group email before ( i do n't think ) ( well , not like this one anyway ) ( of course , i have done group emails of sorts , but ... ) . 
^ i am writing to you because i 'm about to head off up to &name for about &num weeks for a caravan " holiday " , and i 'm not sure i 'll be able to check my emails , as i 'm not sure whether they have electricity in &name . 
^ i 'm pretty sure they do n't have telephone lines anyway . 
^ so , the upshot of all this mental projectional activity on my part is that i probably wo n't be able to reply to your emails for a while ( about &num weeks actually ) . 
^ but rest assured that as soon as i get back i will reply to all who have sent me communications . 
^ " be patient brethren , and you will reap that for which you have laboured " ( &name &num : &num ) 
^ so , all the best , 
^ &name
