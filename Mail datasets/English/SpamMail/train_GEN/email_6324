^ &name , 
^ have sent out an e-mail telling everyone to hold the publicity until i know what you want me to do . . . . ... particularly about the ( non- ) collection of the town tickets on the door . . . ... do we need to send out an ammendment and ask people to include their addresses if they send a cheque ? 
^ ( i think &name did n't understand my extensive instructions about what should go to the university and what should go to the town ... i never thought the uni . 
^ tickets could be collected on the door . ... ) 
^ the offensive sentence has gone to all the churches and chapels but &num else ( as far as i know ) . 
^ do we need to send out a general apology ? 
^ i really am very sorry . 
^ i 'm going to go and pray and go to bed now ... i ca n't believe that i should 've done something like this ... oh dear , oh dear . ... i was just trying to do what the exec . 
^ wanted . . ... i guess i did n't realise how the thing read . 
^ i lifted it pretty much straight from &name " e-mail . 
^ i did double-check everything . ... i guess i just do n't know how to spell . . ... 
^ oh , i 'm so sorry , &name ... i know you do n't need this . ... i 'm going to pray very hard that there are n't any further repercussions . 
^ i should have cleared what i sent out with you first . . . ... i think i was trying to do things quickly and very late at night . ... okay , so why am i making excuses ? ... basically , i just messed up . 
^ i 'm so so sorry . 
^ if anyone gets upset about this , it was my fault not yours .
