^ dearest &name , i do want to come and see you , i just forgot- and yes , i am very busy with stupid work , but i still want to see you . 
^ i do see it from your poin of view- i do understand- but i really did n't forget on purpose ; i just have a lot on my mind at the moment . 
^ i 'm sorry i irritate you , but i ca n't do much about that , really , except try exceptionally hard not to forget- and i really did n't mean to . 
^ i 'll see you at &name 's birthday bonanza . 
^ if i can find you among the multitude of people he 's invited , it 'd be nice to say hello . 
^ love &name xx

^ dear &name , 
^ &name , sorry , sorry , sorry ... 
^ please forgive me - i get easily irritated about people not being on time / forgeting appointments etc. 
^ " it certainly does n't sound like you want to see me . " 
^ - this may seem like strange logic , but if i did n't want to see you i would n't be bothered if you did n't turn up . 
^ i do want to see you . 
^ that 's why i was very disappointed when you did n't turn up . 
^ i wo n't bother asking you to try and see it from my point of view because i have no wish to have an argument . 
^ i 'm really sorry for offending you . 
^ if you 're too busy with work then why did n't you say so ? 
^ you do n't have to come and see me if you 're stressed about you dissertation , exams , etc. just let me know . 
^ as for my reply to &name 's email ; that was not petulance and should not have been taken for it . 
^ it is quite true that i am not usually one to go to formal dinners ( having only been to &num and i 'm in third year ) so i think me reply was quite justified and was intended top be a positive statement of approval for &name 's idea . 
^ whether your judgement of it was coloured by our earlier " encounter " i have no idea , but i certainoly hope everyone else did n't see it the same way as you did . 
^ " what happened to forgive and forget ? " i 've forgiven and forgotten - now , but it took me a few hours to do so . 
^ i am really very very very far from perfect and that is why i was so temperamental . 
^ hope you feel less tired , less stressed and less rubbish very soon ,

^ &name , about your text messages ; if you do n't want me to come and see you , i wo n't, seeing as i have a " great capacity for irritating ( you ) " ; it certainly does n't sound like you want to see me . 
^ what can i say ? 
^ you hated it when i wrote you something this rude , and now you 're doing it to me . 
^ i am tired and incredibly worried about my work . 
^ i am sorry that i forgot to come and see you , but i really do n't think it merits this kind of behaviour , and i really ca n't take it at the moment . 
^ it just seems really petulant , as does your comment replying to &name 's email about the festival dinner . 
^ what happened to forgive and forget ? 
^ you make me feel really bad ; as if i 'm not feeling rubbish enough already . 
^ i do n't really know what else to write . 
^ &name .
