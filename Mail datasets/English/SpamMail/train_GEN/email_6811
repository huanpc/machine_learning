^ looks great to me- just a few points ... 
^ &num ) have you found out where toilets are situated ? 
^ ( and filled this in the &num relevant places ? ) 
^ &num ) question re " new &name ensemble' - this comes up at least twice- in &name &name 's biog and in &name mead's- both in lower case . 
^ is this correct , or should it be " &name &name &name " ? 
^ &num ) &name &name 's biog- perhaps it would be better to keep the letters &name &char together , rather than split over &num lines ? 
^ &num ) &name staples- the last &num sentences are each on separate paragraphs- is this necessary ? 
^ ( but please bear in mind i 'm no arts student , so do n't really know a thing about paragraphs anyway ! ) 
^ &num ) in &name 's biog , and the 1st para of the intro talk , we have " bible " in lower case . 
^ i normally use a capital &char , but again , this may just be my mistake &smiley 
^ &num ) do we need " 's around the biblical quote at the beginning of the intro talk ? 
^ &num ) acknowledgements- not sure about thanking &name &name , do n't know what you think though ? 
^ also , how about " the publicity team and all * others * ( rahter &name " those " ) who helped publicise the concert' - or just " all those who helped with publicity " ? 
^ &smiley choir list- alphabetical order ? 
^ or is there a reason for having it as it is ? 
^ also , you could put " ( leader ) " next to &name 's name , but i 'll leave that to you 
^ ok , that 's all i could find , hope that 's all clear , sorry to be a bit terse- got a lot to do this morning ... &smiley 
^ hope to see you later- do n't worry if you ca n't get to the beginning of the prayer meeting , if you can make it at all , you might like to bring programmes with you for folding etc ! 
^ &name i will be coming late , around &num i 'll forward you the directions &char sent him for getting to my room , in case that would be useful for you ... 
^ thanks again for everything ! 
^ love &name
