^ why should i get the choice between a4 / legal / letter size of paper ? 
^ in 
^ 46rance , you ca n't buy in a shop legal size paper only &name and i guess in &char orth &name it is the opposite . 
^ you should be able to change the size of the paper in a option dialog ( you do it once in a while ) or with a wizard but &char ot in a startup dialog where if you fumble and press by mistake the wrong size 
^ you 'll finish with strange problems when you start printing .

^ &char ) when the open existing file button is clicked the current dialog disappears and is replaced with a stand alone &name . 
^ this would leave us wi th the quandry of what to do if the user presses cancel in the &name ( probably just treat it as if they pressed &name in the koffice open dialog , but another possibility is to go back to the koffice dialog first ... )

^ i think it is the best solution . 
^ the user will understand than pressing the 
^ " open existing file " is the same action than doing file--)open . 
^ the same action should bring the same widget .
