^ hi &name 
^ hope you 're well and that work is n't getting you down . 
^ sorry i did n't re ply to this earlier - i meant to and do n't really have a good excuse for not doing so . 
<text_embedded> 

^ you really should n't be running around &name buying people flowers , with all the work you have to do and busyness etc. ! ! ! 
</text_embedded>

^ contrarily , i _wanted_ to thank you ( and everyone else ) personally and would n't have been happy otherwise , since i feel a personal debt of grati tude to you all , as well as wanting to thank you on behalf of &name . 
^ in particular , the flowers were very much from me rather than &name because you were a really great support to me through the whole concert thing and i really appreciate that . 
^ without you and &name there giving me personall &char encouragement and support , i 'd not have been able to cope with this term . 
^ you were a great source of blessing to me ! 
<text_embedded> 

^ do n't worry too much about thanking everyone . . ... we should n't be doing it in order to be thanked anyway . 
</text_embedded>

^ no ... and it would be a bit silly to take on jobs in &name for any side benefits you may gain ... but it 's nice to thank and be thanked anyway 
<text_embedded> 

^ having said which , thank-you so much . 
^ it was so lovely to get home toda &char and find flowers and your wonderful god-centred card ! 
^ i thank &name for &char he work he has done in the lives of people like you and &name . 
^ so many people out there do n't live according to the love of the cross , and &char &char as feeling this painfully last week . 
^ the contrast was an encouragement to me and the way everyone was serving &name during the concert helped me throu gh a spiritual battle i was fighting . 
</text_embedded>

^ hey , i 'm glad i could be of some kind of encouragement . 
^ your enthusiasm and faith were equally an encouragement to many on the team . 
^ &name has taught me a lot through these concerts and one of the things has been to point me to him working in others and to encourage and teach me through that which has be en a great source of blessing to me . 
<text_embedded> 

^ the way you and &name have run the concert has been an inspiration to me throughout . 
^ somebody should thank-you for your willing service and the kindness and love with which you treated &char our team . 
^ as i said to &name , i do n't know who 's job it is to do this , but anyway , i thank you on &name 's behalf , as it were ( if that 's not a dodgy theological position ! ! ! ) 
</text_embedded>

^ i 'm not sure about from a theological position how this stands and i woul i have to spend a lot of time thinking it through if i were to make up my &char &name on that , but thanks anyway &smiley it has actually been a source of great blessing to do these concerts and &name has used them to teach me and enabl &char me to grow which has been great . 
^ we have a good &name ! 
<text_embedded>

^ hi 
^ i popped round this evening , but you were out . 
^ the flowers are from me as a thank you for your support & encouragement you 've given me throu gh the concert proceedings and for the kindness , generosity and concern that you showed to me . 
^ thank you ! 
^ the other item should be fairly self-explanatory . 
^ glad to hear that you 're feeling a bit better , well rested and more positive . 
^ do make sure you get plenty of rest until you 're completely better and do n't try to push yourself .

^ 1: &num etc. 
^ i could do with knowing from you how much money you 've spent on the concert , both for publicity ( stationary etc. ) and programmes ( &pound; &num . 
^ &num ? ) . 
^ we 've got enough money in the income as far as i can see to pay for a ll of this ( praise &name for this ! ) so let me know and we can reimburse &name &char . 
^ as for the stapler , there 's no rush , so get it to me in your own time &name might be easiest to give it to an &name at stag on sunday . 
^ as for me , i 'm fine , though as to be expected very busy ! 
^ i guess pra yer for help to fit everything in that i need to ( group project deadline far too close for comfort ) , that i would n't overly stress with it all and for relations with the rest of my group would be good . 
^ i also had some interesting conversations with one of my supervisors at comp . 
^ sci . 
^ fo rmal hall yesterday , so please do pray for them - both ex " christians " . 
^ &char &char for &name , she has n't been particularly well either , though we 've be en praying for her too and she 's getting better . 
^ obviously it 's hardly helped her work situation though . 
^ so if you could pray for her , i 'm sure she 'd really appreciate that . 
^ is there anything else i can be praying for for you ? 
^ take care and look after yourself ,
