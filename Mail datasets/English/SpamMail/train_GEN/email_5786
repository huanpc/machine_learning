^ hi &name ! 
^ did you make the grade for the &name trip ? 
^ hope you did ! 
^ ( vicarious thrill : have always wanted to go to &name &name , though for me , would prefer a spanish-speaking country . 
^ love spanish but have forgotten it all now since school , which is very sad . 
^ was doing class at the language centre but never finished as i degraded . . ... ) 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ but now i am doing lots of fun things . 
^ which is probably not the right thing for exam term &smiley 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ recently discovered ctrl 
^k in &name , which have to use via telnet on &name 's computer in house . 
^ it 's great : cutting my reply time by half , practically . 
^ all these little things that you just do n't know until someone happens to mention it in passing . 
^ anyway , think doing lots of fun things is good . 
^ for you anyway . 
^ i doubt if you 're in any danger of doing disasterously badly in your exams , unlike me and i get the feeling that fun things has n't been the main focus of the year for you before now ! 
^ &name made a beautiful and varied world out of the overflow of his unimagineable delight in creation . 
^ by all means enjoy his goodness and praise him for it ! ! 
^ &name &name from &name &name has passed me some photos from the snow in &name on the house party , remember ? 
^ i was so excited to see snow for the first time . 
^ and i remember on the walk , i said " every good and perfect gift is from above " and really meant it . 
^ and then some bloke ( do n't remember who it was ) spoilt it all by saying in a very serious and admonishing tone that i could n't say that and the world was fallen and everything was n't lovely and he disliked people quoting scripture that way etc. etc. and i guess he had a point . 
^ but , like , i was really impressed by the snow . 
^ still more so when it covered &name the next term , even though it made me sick . 
^ and i think that 's a valid feeling , y' know ? 
^ and ( hypocritically ) every time i think about the snow and that walk now , i remember what he said and how he managed to completely spoil my exultation in &num fell sweep and spoilt the memory for me . ... so that 's not a loving way of thinking , i know , and we 're all as bad as each other . 
^ good job i ca n't remember who it was . 
^ what was my point ? 
^ there was none . 
^ i think you are being introduced to me on rambling mode , having previously got some quite sharply composed e-mails ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ sorry to hear things are going tough at the moment . 
^ it 's not easy doing something you do n't enjoy and find hard . 
^ but " the lord gives strength to his people ; the lord blesses his people with peace " ( &name &num : &num ) and 'do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid " ( &name &num : &num ) . 
^ " our citizenship is in heaven . 
^ and we eagerly await a saviour from there , the &name &name &name " . 
^ ( &name &num : &num ) 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ i keep getting pulled up short at the command 'do not let your hearts be troubled . " and 'do not be anxious about anything . " it 's hard to keep perspective , is n't it ? 
^ i think more sincere quiet times and a lot more prayer would go a long way towards that . 
^ i 'm not being terribly faithful at the moment . . . ... but it 's astounded me that , contrary to expectation , and definitely in answer to prayer , i 've had so many opportunities to evangelise this term , so far . ... yet i feel as though i am speaking out of emptiness , like the person listening is gonna see right through how useless i 'm being at the moment in my christian life . 
^ i feel like i 'm serving out of emptiness . 
^ ever had that feeling ? 
^ i just keep praying that &name will be pleased to use my efforts even though i 'm so impure in my heart . . ... 
^ &name .. it just occurred to me that my answer was right there ( about a million times ) in the passage at &name training today ... 
^ " i am the vine you are the branches . ... " wow , writing letters / e-mails always helps me get my thoughts together . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ sounds good - i 'm looking forward to it anyway and been considering for a while whether to get involved in this mission next year , so this may be a helpful guide in that 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ hey , hope it 's really great ! 
^ you never sit still do you ? 
^ always on the lookout for opportunities ... 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ if i go , then yes , it will be my first trip to &name &name and indeed outside &name . 
^ not sure about the speaking portuguese , but perhaps i 'll 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name , i keep forgetting how spoilt i am and everytime someone says they 've never been outside &name , i feel surprised . 
^ when you move continents to go to uni , it kind of changes your perspective on things . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ was n't she int rep last term ? 
^ i think i met her at a link meeting . 
^ i do n't 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ yes , that 's the one . 
^ she 's a good friend of mine . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i gave her directions today , so i hope that she can make some sense of them ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ she made it . 
^ it 's cool to have a malaysian in the group now . 
^ she said she reckoned she 'd come along every week . 
^ she 's a lot like me . 
^ in &name not &name and not in &name and knows what i mean when i say i 'm a " traitor " to my nationality in &name circles . 
^ went to school in sevenoaks and did the &name , like me , going to an international school and doing the &name . 
^ &name to meet someone a bit similar once in a way ! 
^ she might be helping out with &name in &name in the summer and i said that if she did and let me know where she 'd be i might go up and say hello on the train . 
^ that 'd be cool . 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ & &name &name told me when i took on the job - oh , it 's just a small thing - only about an hour training and an hour prep a week . 
^ if only i could prep it in an hour ! 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ oh well , not all of us are as talented as each other ! 
^ it takes me like &num hours to prep ! 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded>

<text_embedded> 

^ &name 's word is so amazing . 
</text_embedded>

</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name &num : &num ( i 'm working through &name in &name 1-2-1s at the &name , so recently came across this ) 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ goodness me , &num as well ! 
^ i 'm never going to be able to keep up with you ! ! ! 
^ &smiley 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ &name reckons that you have to pick out a main point which you want to draw and then drive that out as you work through the passage - a variation of what she called 'motorway preaching " . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ very wise advice . 
^ yes i think &num kind of worked that one out for the second study . 
^ it 's what you think is most fitting to the group you 're working with , is n't it . 
^ what you think will most inspire / motivate / challenge them . . ... 
^ well , this is long ! ! 
^ sorry , know you 're busy . 
^ will try to be more circumspect next time ! 
^ hope the busy weekend goes fantastic . 
^ love in &name , &name
