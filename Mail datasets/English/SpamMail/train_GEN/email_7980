^ metaphors from &name essays 
^ her face was a perfect oval , like a circle that had its &num other sides gently compressed by a thigh master . 
^ his thoughts tumbled in his head , making and breaking alliances like underpants in a tumble dryer . 
^ she caught your eye like one of those pointy hook latches that used to dangle from doors and would fly up whenever you banged the door open again . 
^ the little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a &name &name would n't . 
^ &name fell &num stories , hitting the pavement like a paper bag filled with vegetable soup . 
^ her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after a sneeze . 
^ her eyes were like &num brown circles with big black dots in the centre 
^ her vocabulary was as bad as , like , whatever . 
^ he was as tall as a six-foot-three-inch tree . 
^ the hailstones leaped from the pavement , just like maggots when you fry them in hot grease . 
^ long separated by cruel fate , the star-crossed lovers raced across the grassy field toward each other like &num freight trains , one having left &name at &num : &num p.m. travelling at &num mph , the other from &name at &num : 19p.m . 
^ at a speed of &num mph . 
^ the politician was gone but unnoticed , like the full stop after the dr. on a dr &name can . 
^ &name and &name had never met . 
^ they were like &num hummingbirds who had also never met . 
^ the thunder was ominous sounding , much like the sound of a thin sheet of metal being shaken backstage during the storm scene in a play . 
^ the red brick wall was the colour of a brick-red crayon . 
^ even in his last years , &name had a mind like a steel trap , only one that had been left out so long it had rusted shut . 
^ the door had been forced , as forced as the dialogue during the interview portion of family fortunes . 
^ shots rang out , as shots are wont to do . 
^ the plan was simple , like my brother &name . 
^ but unlike &name , this plan just might work . 
^ the young fighter had a hungry look , the kind you get from not eating for while . 
^ " oh , &name , take me ! " she panted , her breasts heaving like a student on 31p-a-pint night . 
^ he was as lame as a duck . 
^ not the metaphorical lame duck either , but a real duck that was actually lame . 
^ maybe from stepping on a land mine or something . 
^ her artistic sense was exquisitely refined , like someone who can tell butter from " i ca n't believe it 's not butter . " 
^ she had a deep , throaty , genuine laugh , like that sound a dog makes just before it throws up . 
^ it came down the stairs looking very much like something no one had ever seen before . 
^ the knife was as sharp as the tone used by &name &name &name in her first several points of parliamentary procedure made to &name &name &name , leader of the house of &name , in the house &name committee hearings on the suspension of &name &name &name . 
^ the ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her , like a dog at a lamppost . 
^ the revelation that his marriage of &num years had disintegrated because of his wife 's infidelity came as a rude shock , like a surcharge at a formerly surcharge-free cashpoint . 
^ the dandelion swayed in the gentle breeze like an oscillating electric fan set on medium . 
^ it was a working class tradition , like fathers chasing kids around with their power tools . 
^ he was deeply in love . 
^ when she spoke , he thought he heard bells , as if she were a dustcart reversing . 
^ she was as easy as the &name &name crossword . 
^ she grew on him like she was a colony of &name coli and he was room-temperature british beef . 
^ she walked into my office like a centipede with &num missing legs . 
^ her voice had that tense , grating quality , like a first-generation thermal paper fax machine that needed a band tightened . 
^ it hurt the way your tongue hurts after you accidentally staple it to the wall .
