^ i realise some of you found it difficult to get in for my lecture today - what i suggest is that you go through the handout and have a look at &name and &name &num ( even those of you who were in the lecture would probably benefit from having a look at that , since my notes are somewhat sketchy ) . 
^ if there 's demand , i will then schedule a tutorial session for 11am on &name 14th , where i can go through that and anything else that 's come up about dialogue systems or language &num . 
^ the rest of the dialogue systems lectures do n't depend on you knowing about this stuff , however .
