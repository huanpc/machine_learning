^ just a thought , but &name , i think you 'd better just say the 15th as it 's getting a bit late and the longer you leave it the more red faced the blonde from up north will get ... 
^ love you , &name 
^ could we get some degree of noise out of you people as to yes or no. .. if it 's looking good i 'll book my train tickets ... if not strangely enough i wo n't! !
