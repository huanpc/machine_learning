^ hi , &name ! 
^ &name to hear from you ! 
^ i had n't realized that you were still at school -- i thought you were done by now . 
^ when will you be going to &name ? 
^ i 'll be sending your belated birthday card and gift in the latter half of next week ( you 'll understand why , when you see it ! ) . 
^ anyway , shall i send it to your house in &name ? 
^ i naively sent you an electronic birthday card via your dad 's email account , assuming you were already home . 
^ did you get it ? 
^ hope you had a good birthday . 
^ your plans for the summer sound exciting-- we 'll keep you in our prayers and hope that we 'll be able to cross paths when you get to w' loo ! 
^ take care &name , &name and the gang &smiley &name greetings to your family , too . 
^ i just sent off a long letter to your mum via snail mail ( i wonder if she 'll ever like email ? 
^ it 's sure easier to read than my handwriting ! ) bye !

^ dear friends , 
^ i realize i have not written to you for some time , but this is not because i have forgotten you ! 
^ i am having a very busy year here in &name , and am presently in the middle of exams . 
^ so , i 'm sure it is also obvious to you that it is of utmost importance to write an e-mail at this time . 
^ ( anything to get away from revision ! ) 
^ i hope you are all well . 
^ the weather here in &name is finally starting to look up , and after a particularly rainy winter , it is easy to believe we deserve it ! 
^ my life has been quite manic the last term and a bit , as i have been trying to sort out a dissertation and things like that . 
^ this process was upset on more that &num occasion , by 'minor " problems such as &name and mouth disease , etc. i have finally got that sorted , and will be accompanying &num other students to mammoth lakes in &name , this summer , to map the rocks around that area . 
^ ( that 's what geologists do ! ) 
^ anyway , that will last for &num weeks , and i 'm sure will be quite tiring , but hopefully a lot of fun as well ! 
^ after &name , i 'll be going up to &name for a week , which will be great , and then i 'll move on to &name for a holiday with my dear family . 
^ ( sound busy ? ) i think when i return to &name my accent will once more be quite north american . 
^ i have finished leading chapel now , which is both a nice break , and also something which i miss . 
^ &name well , i still go along . 
^ &name has so blessed that service this last year . 
^ it has been amazing ! 
^ i would appreciate it if you would pray for me over this summer , as i will be away from most of my family and friends for a long period of time , esp . 
^ the &num weeks in &name ( 2nd june - 12th july ) . 
^ certain prayer points include : 
^ that i would keep my focus on &name the whole time , and live accordingly . 
^ that i might be a servant to the other students who i am mapping with . 
^ they are both female mature students , and are not christians , so i feel the best way to treat them is to serve them . 
^ this is gonna be hard for me , and i 'll need all the prayer you can give . 
^ that i might find a church for my time in &name lakes . 
^ that i would keep safe and have a good time . 
^ that &name might give me opportunities to talk to &name and &name ( the ladies with whom i am mapping ) about him , and share the gospel with them . 
^ that i would grow in &name both before , and during this trip . 
^ ( and that i would use that wisdom too ! ) 
^ but before all that , if you could pray that i could really concentrate on getting some good marks in these exams , i.e. , being able to keep at my work , i would really appreciate that ! 
^ thanks very much for all your friendship + support . 
^ love ,
