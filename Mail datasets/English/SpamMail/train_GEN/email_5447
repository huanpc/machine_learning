^ dear professor &name , 
^ i was wondering whether i could meet you for a few minutes ( today if possible ) to discuss how i should determine the multiple classes for each word . 
^ i think i know how to change &name code to build a model for all permutations but i am unclear on how i can locate the relevant class fron the class map . 
^ thank you . 
^ with best wishes , &name &name
