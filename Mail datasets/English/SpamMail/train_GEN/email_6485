^ ok , looks good , thanks . 
^ just a few comments : 
^ &char &name &name exists to ... 
^ &char &name " should have ( small somewhere ) by kind permission ... 
^ &char not all ticket sales methods are equal - students are most likely to go by e-mail or &name , so might be worth making them bigger to really stand out &char since people often do n't see them for long , prob best just to use the @ sign for the e-mail address as it quickly identifies something as being an e-mail address , so draws attention to itself 
^ otherwise it 's fine . 
^ many thanks 
^ love &name
