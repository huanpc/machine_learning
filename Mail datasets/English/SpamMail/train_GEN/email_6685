^ expect you have had a postcard form mum and &name from &name . 
^ all well there it seems . 
^ here we ran out of milk on the same evening the toaster blew up ! 
^ &name almost run out now . 
^ &name 's computer now has a &name writer - same as &name 's except with &name software . 
^ to cope with a slight under specification we put in some extra memory , probably way over the top but better safe than sorry - he now has &name ! ! 
^ working well . 
^ have just ordered &name 's computer . 
^ unfortunately you can no longer collect computers from them in order to avoid delivery charges , except if the machines are off the shelf . 
^ so it will be delivered here after all at a price . ...
