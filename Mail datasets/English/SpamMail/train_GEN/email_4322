^ ok &name , 
</text_normal>
<text_embedded> 

^ i was under the impression that the party was from 31st to the 2nd . 
^ was i wrong ? 
^ if the party is only for &num day then it 's a very very long way to come from &name for such a short time . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ &name has invited some people to spend a couple of days at his house around new year . 
^ this is not the case with everyone , and i am not organising that . 
^ speak to &name if you are unsure as to whether his invitation still holds ! 
</text_normal>

^ also , why are we arriving so late on the 31st ? 
^ my train might get in a lot earlier . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ oh my goodness ! 
^ well , &name , for you i think we can make an exception - but again if you want to arrange with &name to arrive earlier and spend the afternoon at his house ( or mine ! ) then that should be fine .

^ thirdly , how can we forward this to people you may have missed out if we ca n't see who you 've sent it to ? 
^ you did something funny with the sent field and it appears only to have been sent to you . 
</text_embedded>
<text_normal> 

^ the way it works is : if you 've invited someone then you ask them if they 've had an email from me , and if not you forward it to them . 
^ i know it 's a bit of extra hassle , but there are reasons for it , and i 'm the big cheese here &name i 'm organising it so if you do n't like it then tough cheddar ! 
^ &name this clears things up you chunky monkey !
