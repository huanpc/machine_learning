^ hi &name , 
^ i am trying to package some software for web deployment . 
^ i have recently downloaded your program and wanted to know whether there is anyway of doing the following : 
^ &num i created &name file 
^ &num &name creation i need to include an extra file into &name ( this file will be different for each end install - the addiition will be done by an administrator and then the &name will be made available to an end user ) 
^ i tried using winzip to open and add a file ( as this is a common tool - that most administrators can get access to ) - and i believe this corrupts the &name info somehow and therefore prevents it from executing . 
^ any help on this matter is appreciated . 
^ thank you for your time . 
^ regards &name &name
